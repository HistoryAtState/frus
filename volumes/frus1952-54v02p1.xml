                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <list>
                    <item>
                        <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> To avoid publication of matters which would tend
                        to impede current diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                    <item>
                        <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> To condense the record and avoid repetition of
                        needless details.</item>
                    <item>
                        <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> To preserve the confidence reposed in the

                        despatches and not acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there
                        is one qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable,
                        where possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before
                        the decision was made.</item>

                <p>Documents selected for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes are referred to the Department of State
                    Classification/Declassification Center for declassification clearance. The
                    Center reviews <pb xml:id="pg_IV" n="IV" facs="0008"/>the documents, makes
                    declassification decisions, and obtains the clearance of geographic and
                    functional bureaus of the Department of State, as well as of other appropriate
                    agencies of the government. The Center, in coordination with the geographic
                    bureaus of the Department of State, conducts communications with foreign
                    governments regarding documents or information of those governments proposed for
                    inclusion in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p>This volume was initially prepared under the general supervision of Fredrick
                    Aandahl and, at a later stage, of William Z. Slany, his successor as General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. John P. Glennon,
                    Charles S. Sampson, and William F. Sanford, Jr., assisted in final preparation.
                    Neal H. Petersen was responsible for the planning, review, and editing of the
                    volume. Mr. Petersen compiled the documentation on the President’s Committee on
                    International Information Activities and collaborated with Lisle A. Rose in the
                    preparation of the documentation on atomic energy and regulation of armaments.
                    Mr. Rose prepared the compilations on national security policy and the foreign
                    information program.</p>
                <p>Rita M. Baker of the Publishing Services Division (Paul M. Washington, Chief)
                    performed the technical editing under the supervision of Margie R. Wilber. The
                    index was prepared by the Twin Oaks Indexing Collective.</p>

                        attended by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
                        Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of
                        each of the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

                        directed that I work with the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to revise
                        the budget of the Department of Defense to reflect your decision to stretch
                        out the build-up of the defense program because of material and fiscal
                        considerations. This stretch-out was to be accomplished within expenditures
                        estimated at $44 billion for F.Y. 1952 and $60 billion for F.Y. 1953. It is
                        understood that these estimated expenditure figures cover both expenditures
                        for the account of the Department of Defense and the military portion of the
                        Mutual Security appropriations.</p>
                    <p>While there was no decision as to the amount of new obligational authority to
                        be included in the budget for F.Y. 1953, it was understood that it was to be
                        adequate to sustain the stretched-out program, and to permit the Department
                        of Defense to achieve a steady build-up of production over as much of this
                        period as possible.</p>

                        above totals for new obligational authority are exclusive of the new
                        authority required for financing public works projects in F.Y. 1953,

                    <p>3. That the funds appropriated for Military Assistance be made available to
                        the Department of Defense in such a manner as to permit the most
                        advantageous overall production program that can be achieved, taking into
                        consideration the combined needs of the U.S. Forces and our Allies.</p>
                    <p>4. That the Military Departments, with the approval of the Secretary of
                        Defense, be granted permission, prior to or during the coming Congressional
                        hearing, to adjust the amounts between appropriations if further study of
                        the proposed program indicates that such adjustments would result in a
                        better balanced program within the total appropriations being recommended
                        for each of the Departments. This request is made because of the limited
                        period of time during which the Department of Defense has had to consider
                        the results of the revised appropriation distribution.</p>

                                with $61.7 billion in 1952. The President declared that “This
                                reduction is possible because a substantial portion of the
                                obligational authority required to finance our military expansion
                                has already been provided by the Congress.” The President’s Annual

                        Future Soviet Actions)</p>
                    <p>1. Whatever the estimate, and the field is, of course, highly speculative, of
                        Soviet future actions or long-range and short-range intentions, there are
                        certain fundamental features of the Soviet system which are generally
                        uncontested by all analyses. These fundamental factors represent the solid
                        and unchanging basis for the programs of rearmament in the Western world.
                        Regardless of any particular phase of Soviet policy, it is generally
                        accepted that the Soviet system:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Is a totalitarian state, heavily armed and continuously seeking to
                            increase its military potential, where the power of decision rests
                            entirely in the hands of a small group of men;</item>
                        <item>b. By the nature of its state structure, reinforced by its ideology,
                            is fundamentally and unappeasably hostile to any society not susceptible
                            to its control;</item>
                        <item>c. The directing group of the Soviet Government and of international
                            Communism are totally uninhibited by any considerations of a
                            humanitarian, moral, or ethical character which have acted, in history,
                            as restraints upon the use of force.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>These factors, quite apart from any other considerations, require that the
                        non-Soviet world and the United States in particular, not permit a decisive
                        imbalance in military force in favor of the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>2. Drawing conclusions about future Soviet actions is not only difficult but
                        can be dangerous unless it is borne in mind that the purpose for which one
                        attempts to do so is to find the best—or least bad–assumption for planning
                        purposes, in other words, to draw only those conclusions which it is <hi
                            rend="italic">safe</hi> to make the background of one’s own
                        behavior.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_6" n="6" facs="0036"/>
                    <p>3. In order to have some context within which profitably to draw conclusions
                        about future Soviet actions it may be helpful to make an arbitrary
                        distinction between two dangers: (a) the danger of becoming involved in
                        global war, and (b) the danger of being defeated in a global war. In that
                        way we can at least put aside initially what it is we are <hi rend="italic"
                            >not</hi> studying. Because there is no important disagreement that if
                        matters reach the point where the Soviets attain the capability of
                        delivering a “decisive”<note n="*" xml:id="d5fn-sym1">A “decisive” blow is
                            one which renders the enemy incapable of further serious action.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> initial blow on the United States
                        without serious risk to their own regime, they would do so, i.e., that they
                        would do so would have to be considered so probable for planning purposes,
                        that it would be unprofitable to argue about degrees of possibility. What we
                        are considering here then is the probable nature of Soviet actions short of
                        delivering a “decisive” blow on the United States.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviet regime came to power in October 1917 with what the Bolsheviks
                        considered to be a clear, thoroughly thought out thesis, or doctrine, which
                        described the direction of the future course of world history. In seizing
                        power by a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> rather than by the prescribed
                        revolution and in a country which had none of the doctrinaire prerequisites
                        for socialism they immediately violated the doctrine, and have continued to
                        do so ever since. The life of the Soviet regime has been one continual
                        contradiction and, in essence, Soviet actions have represented an unending
                        series of compromises as, with each concrete situation facing them, they
                        have attempted to resolve this contradiction. The moment that they seized
                        power they discovered that doctrine was totally inadequate to answer the
                        questions as to how to exercise power in that country, under those
                        circumstances, at that time. Compelled to consolidate the power attained and
                        to strive for absolute control over the captured state, Lenin compromised
                        with doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> has
                        continued to do so, and since 1917 whenever a conflict has arisen between
                        doctrine (the revolutionary ideology) and any question of power, the latter
                        has prevailed without exception. Where Lenin, however, acknowledged each
                        compromise as such, <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> has
                        twisted the doctrine to fit the compromise. His policies therefore have been
                        completely opportunistic—but by necessity, not by design.</p>
                    <p>5. The basic contradiction, then, lies in the twin necessities of maintaining
                        power at home and advocating revolution abroad. From this has sprung the
                        dual nature of the State wherein the same men are at once the rulers of the
                        Soviet Union and the Board of Directors of an international conspiracy. To
                        date no sacrifice of the State has been made for the benefit of the world
                        revolutionary <pb xml:id="pg_7" n="7" facs="0037"/>movement. It is
                        unnecessary, however, to state dogmatically that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> regime is interested in
                        maintaining power in Russia entirely for the sake of power and not at all as
                        a base for eventual world revolution since, for the foreseeable future, they
                        amount to the same thing. The prime preoccupation of the masters of the
                        Kremlin remains the security of the home base and there is no realistic sign
                        that in the foreseeable future the internal situation in Russia will undergo
                        such radical alteration as to remove this preoccupation from their
                        minds.</p>
                    <p>6. Furthermore, the specific and artificial nature of the Stalinist regime,
                        which bears little resemblance to any socialist or communist society as
                        envisaged by either Marx or Lenin makes it probable, if not inevitable, that
                        any Communist regime not susceptible of control by the Soviet Union would be
                        basically different in its development from Stalinist Russia and hence
                        potentially hostile to it. The relationship of the Soviet Union and other
                        Communist states which it cannot control is a subject of extreme complexity
                        and one on which we have very little evidence to base any firm conclusions,
                        but as Tito illustrates, the mere fact of being Communist does not eliminate
                        the possibility of a hostile relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>7. To say that the ideology of Communism and the doctrine of Marx and Lenin
                        do not provide any real guide to Soviet action, in the sense of cause and
                        effect, does not mean that doctrine does not have an effect on Soviet
                        action. The effect is indirect but nonetheless real. Doctrine has served as
                        the rationalization and justification of Soviet actions taken for different
                        reasons. By this fact alone it conditions to an important degree the manner
                        in which the action is taken. And it is the bait that attracts supporters
                        abroad. In one field, furthermore, it has a very important effect, and that
                        is in the field of analysis of situations in non-Soviet countries and,
                        hence, on the Soviet estimate of the policies of non-Soviet governments.
                        Available information indicates that in the analysis of the development of
                        capitalist society, rivalries between capitalist powers, and the
                        relationship between “colonial powers and colonial or semi-colonial peoples”
                        the Soviet rulers operate quite literally according to doctrine. It is in
                        this field that doctrine plays its greatest role and contains the greatest
                        possibility of serious Soviet miscalculation as to the reaction of other
                        countries (Finland and Korea). In a contradictory sense, however, it also
                        operates as one of the safeguards of world peace and makes our behavior one
                        of the principal factors bearing on Soviet action.</p>
                    <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] General war is clearly not something into
                        which the Soviet rulers would enter lightly. One of the chief factors which
                        they would obviously consider would be the relative strength of the <pb
                            xml:id="pg_8" n="8" facs="0038"/>enemy. But regardless of their estimate
                        of this factor, they must regard any major war as highly dangerous to the
                        regime. It would subject an overburdened economy and their control of the
                        satellites to grievous strains. It would greatly increase the problem of
                        defection. Most seriously of all it would alter to the detriment of the
                        party the relationship between party and army; and control over the army is
                        one of the principal cornerstones of the survival of the regime.</p>
                    <p>8. For such people, however, struggle is the most natural environment. The
                        interests of the regime have no direct relation with the interests,
                        aspirations, and needs of the Russian people. Preoccupied with the problems
                        of maintaining iron discipline over the captive peoples, they are obliged to
                        justify it by the bogey of “capitalist encirclement” and an ostensible goal
                        of world revolution. A tranquil relationship with the outside world, then,
                        becomes impossible and their expansionist tendencies spring from a desire to
                        push the edge of freedom farther and farther away.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Bearing in mind that the purpose of this analysis is neither to draw all
                        possible conclusions concerning Soviet actions nor to set down everything
                        which might help us understand events as they occur but rather to enumerate
                        only those conclusions concerning the nature of future Soviet conduct which
                        will assist in formulating our own strategy, the following may be
                        stated:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. It must be accepted as probable that the Soviets would attack us if
                            they felt they could deliver a “decisive” initial blow to the U.S.
                            without serious risk to their own regime.</item>
                        <item>b. The Soviets might attack if they were convinced as a matter of
                            fact, rather than theory, that an attack by the West was actually
                            imminent—and the facts would probably have to include a physical
                            preponderance of Western strength in being plus a menacing political
                            attitude on our part.</item>
                        <item>c. War could come from miscalculation on the part of the Soviets
                            coupled with the unwinding chain of action and reaction—a concomitant of
                            this conclusion is that our actions play an extremely important part in
                            Soviet actions.</item>
                        <item>d. War could come from accident—as contrasted with
                            miscalculation—simply as a result of the confrontation of two armed and
                            arming hostile powers.</item>
                        <item>e. Short of a above, and possibly b, Soviet action is more likely to
                            be confined to the “cold war”—i.e., a continuous hostility and a pushing
                            and probing toward an exploitation of all Western weaknesses.</item>
                        <item>f. The following represent certain criteria, all of which should be
                            present before the Soviet Union would be likely to take or support overt
                            action against non-Soviet territory but which conditions, even if met,
                            would not necessarily impel such actions: <pb xml:id="pg_9" n="9"

                                <item>(1) That the territory’s accession to Soviet power would have
                                    a direct and important effect in improving the Soviet strategic
                                    position;</item>
                                <item>(2) That the territory could be brought under total Stalinist

                                    the “objective” conditions for revolution, at least to the
                                    extent of providing cover of revolutionary or civil war activity
                                    to which Soviet or satellite forces would bring assistance;

                    <p>Secret</p>
                    <p>Here are a few highlights which spell out briefly the effect of a cut in
                        appropriations for the Air Force<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">Following
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1">Truman</persName>’s
                            submission of his annual budget to Congress on Jan. 21 (see <ref
                                target="#d2fn3">footnote 3</ref>, p. 3), the Department of Defense
                            requested an appropriation of $50.9 billion, $1.5 billion less than the
                            obligational authority requested by the President in January. On Apr. 3,
                            the House Appropriations Committee recommended a $46.7 billion military
                            budget. Cuts totalling $4.2 billion from the Defense request included
                            $1.7 billion in Army requests, $1 billion in Navy requests, and $1.5
                            billion in Air Force requests. Further cuts on the House floor reduced
                            military appropriations to an even $46 billion. (<hi rend="italic"

                            Congressional Quarterly Service, 1965), p. 270)</note> for the FY1953,
                        which you suggested I submit to you prior to your meeting with Mr. Vinson
                        this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Under your budget submitted to the Congress, the Air Force would have
                        received $19, 233, 000, 000 for the FY1953. Under the $46, 000, 000, 000
                        expenditure limitation by the Congress, the Air Force would receive $17,
                        400, 000, 000, or a reduction of $1, 833, 000, 000.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as the Air Force is concerned, such a reduction will bring about very
                        serious and far-reaching effects. For example, such a reduction for FY1953
                        will severely reduce the activation, manning and equipping of air combat
                        units provided for by the President’s budget. The attainment of a modern 126
                        combat wing force would be delayed approximately 18 months.</p>
                    <p>Breaking this down further, the Air Force had planned on attaining a total of
                        96 combat wings by the end of FY1953; only 83 combat wings can be provided
                        with the reduction in funds. In FY1954 the Air Force had planned to attain
                        120 combat wings; only 98 combat wings can be provided under the reduced
                        funds. The Air Force had planned to reach 120 combat wings by December <pb
                            xml:id="pg_10" n="10" facs="0040"/>31, 1955; with reduced funds this
                        cannot be achieved until approximately June 30, 1957. Such a further delay
                        on the top of the previous year stretch-out would be most serious.</p>
                    <p>Under expenditure limitations, aircraft production would have to be
                        substantially reduced. This amounts to the elimination of 3, 000 aircraft
                        (approximately 27%), during the period January 1, 1953 to June 30, 1954.
                        This reduction on top of the previous stretch-out would produce havoc in the
                        industry and probably make it necessary to shut down at least one medium
                        bomber, two jet fighter and three transport and training production
                        facilities, as well as two engine facilities. Obviously the waste that would
                        occur in the build up of production facilities would be enormous. Then, too,
                        our production capability to meet an all-out war, instead of being improved
                        will have been crippled, insofar as our air power is concerned.</p>
                    <p>The effect upon labor would be very harmful in that labor forces would have
                        to be reduced, including some located in critical employment areas.</p>
                    <p>Under this limitation of funds, substantial quantities of combat ammunition
                        would have to be deferred for 12 months. The serious danger here need hardly
                        be mentioned further.</p>
                    <p>There are other items and activities which I shall only mention in passing
                        which will be seriously affected and will not be possible of procurement
                        until after FY1953 with this limitation in expenditures. These are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Substantial quantities of ground support equipment and ground
                            electronic equipment for the control of aircraft in the defense of the
                            United States.</item>
                        <item>b. The capability of the Air Force to maintain its equipment and
                            aircraft in a satisfactory and safe condition would be substantially
                            reduced.</item>
                        <item>c. Stock levels of maintenance materials and consumable supplies below
                            minimum safe levels required for present forces would result (to say
                            nothing of the additional forces which are contemplated).</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. President, in my judgment the results of the expenditure limitation on
                        the Air Force, as a consequence of the $46, 000, 000, 000 expenditure
                        limitation passed by the House, constitutes more than a calculated risk and
                        might well wreck our entire preparedness program and threaten our National
                            security.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">No reply to this memorandum has been
                            found. Senate action on military appropriations at the end of June
                            resulted in a bill appropriating $46.4 billion, and a conference with
                            the House. The conference report carrying a $46.6 billion appropriation
                            was approved by voice votes in both houses on July 5. (<hi rend="italic"

                        from what I have heard about this study it might be better that it not be
                        circulated formally because, unless radical changes are made in the method
                        of developing it, it will probably be worse than useless. Leaving “programs”
                        aside for the moment we are faced, then, with the task of reappraising the
                        policies of the 68 and 114 Series—or, as it has become the custom to express
                        it, our national strategy.</p>
                    <p>That being the case, the first necessity is to identify as clearly as
                        possible those ideas which represent the core of our national strategy. The
                        next task would seem to be to “reappraise” it in such a manner that when we
                        are through we have a better idea than we have now of the nature of the most
                        serious problems facing us and the manner in which we should attempt to meet
                        them. I would suggest an approach somewhat as follows and I would think
                        that, whether we consider this effort as the “conclusions” of the paper
                        which the Steering Group is struggling to write, or as the paper itself,
                        most of the following thoughts should be reflected therein:</p>
                    <p>A. During the two or three years immediately following World War II it became
                        increasingly clear to the U.S. that its national security was again faced
                        with a threat of major proportions and that this threat stemmed primarily
                        from the strength and attitude of the Soviet Union, coupled with the unusual
                        means available to the <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0043"/>Soviet Union
                        for making its strength, and our weaknesses, felt abroad, particularly the
                        apparatus of international communism.</p>

                        Council setting forth the nature of the threat and some ideas as to what we
                        should do about it. The summary conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 20/4 were approved by the Council and by the President. The
                        essence of these ideas was that by methods short of war we would have to
                        encourage and promote a gradual retraction of undue Russian power and change
                        the attitude of the Soviet Union. Implicit in the development of these
                        ideas, and all others that flowed from them, was the belief that we did not
                        have to and should not try to attain these objectives in any specific time
                        period. (To quote from 20/1: “In the first place, there is no time limit for
                        the achievement of our objectives under conditions of peace. We are faced
                        here with no rigid periodicity of war and peace which would enable us to
                        conclude that we must achieve our peacetime objectives by a given date ‘or
                        else’”). Among the most important requirements set forth by 20/4 as
                        essential to the attainment of these objectives were:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. “A level of military readiness which can be maintained as long as
                            necessary as a deterrent to Soviet aggression, as indispensable support
                            to our political attitude toward the U.S.S.R., as a source of
                            encouragement to nations resisting Soviet political aggression, and as
                            an adequate basis for immediate military commitments and for rapid
                            mobilization should war prove unavoidable”, and</item>
                        <item>b. To get as much help from others as possible.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>For the purpose of this study, then, these thoughts can be considered the
                        essence of U.S. national strategy as of the date of approval of 20/4.</p>
                    <p>C. By direction of the President, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 was
                        designed to examine this national strategy in the light of recent evidence
                        that the Soviets had developed an atomic bomb, and to determine whether or
                        not it was still valid and to what extent. <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68 reaffirmed the validity of the national strategy set
                        forth in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20 Series, but found that
                        our level of military readiness was inadequate—in fact, dangerously
                        so—particularly in the light of what we could expect in the way of a
                        developing Soviet atomic capability. The President approved the conclusions
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68.</p>
                    <p>D. The rest of the 68 Series was concerned primarily with the buildup of our
                        military strength in the light of this conclusion and of the Korean war.

                        114/2 were generally inconclusive <pb xml:id="pg_14" n="14" facs="0044"/>and
                        in the process of preparing them sufficient doubts were raised about the
                        validity of U.S. national strategy to make necessary the current
                        “reappraisal”. A basic question is again raised: Does currently approved
                        U.S. national strategy remain valid in the light of the apparently rapidly
                        growing atomic, and possibly thermonuclear, capacity of the U.S.S.R.? In
                        other words, is time of the essence? Can we really hope to “contain” the
                        Soviet Union even if we maintain a high-level military strength
                        indefinitely? Or must we adopt a more “aggressive” policy? To what extent
                        can we rely on the threat, explicit or implicit, of global war to protect
                        the periphery? Can we seriously hope to change the nature of the Soviet
                        Union if we place greater emphasis on the avoidance of war?</p>
                    <p>E. That analysis of the balance of military power between the U.S.S.R. and
                        the U.S., as it is now and as it is expected to develop, which most sharply
                        challenges the validity of our current strategy goes as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. If a certain number of targets in the U.S. were destroyed, the U.S.
                            would face unavoidable defeat.</item>
                        <item>2. The Soviet Union is capable of producing the requisite number of
                            atomic, or thermonuclear, bombs to destroy those targets and is capable
                            of producing the means of delivering the bombs.</item>
                        <item>3. Because primarily of the nature of the weapons, the U.S. will not
                            be capable of preventing the Soviet Union at some time in the not too
                            distant future of delivering the requisite number of bombs on targets in
                            the U.S.</item>
                        <item>4. We must assume—because we cannot afford not to assume— that when
                            the Soviet Union attains such a capability, it will be used against
                            us.</item>
                        <item>5. Therefore, we must overthrow the Soviet Union prior to the time
                            when we think the Soviet Union can attain and employ against us such a
                            capability. Time is, then, of the essence. We do have to attain our
                            national objectives with respect to the Soviet Union by a certain date,
                            “or else”. That date can be put off somewhat by the nature and extent of
                            our armament effort; but, by the very nature of the mathematical
                            inevitability of the Soviet attainment of the capability under
                            reference, it cannot be put off indefinitely. And our currently approved
                            national strategy as set forth herein is invalid.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>F. If, however, we examine this atomic analysis, we find that it is unsound
                        for a number of reasons, of which the following are the most important:</p>
                    <p>1. A key part of the analysis (subparagraph E, 3) is based not only on the
                        fact that we do not have today defenses adequate to keep out a large
                        percentage of our attacking force but also on the assumption that we are
                        incapable of developing such defenses for the future. (50% on target of
                        bombs sortied seems to have been accepted as a constant.) This assumption
                        gives <hi rend="italic">no</hi> consideration to the fact that new weapons
                        are constantly being developed, and that, in <pb xml:id="pg_15" n="15"
                            facs="0045"/>the past, new defensive weapons which could successfully
                        challenge new offensive weapons have invariably been produced. The point is
                        that while we cannot rely on the development of adequate new weapons neither
                        is it wise or advisable to ignore completely the possibilities in this
                        field. That the possibilities are great is evidenced, in one important
                        instance at least, by the fact that the atomic bomb itself was designed,
                        developed and used within a four-year period.</p>
                    <p>2. The analysis must assume one, or some combination, of the following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. That, regardless of the defensive measures which we may take, the
                            Soviets will be able to destroy our retaliatory capacity;</item>
                        <item>b. That, although the Soviets might not be able completely to destroy
                            our retaliatory capacity, they could inflict on it such damage that we
                            in turn would be unable to do major damage to the Soviet Union,
                            particularly as the Soviets would measure “major damage” against the
                            advantage of eliminating the U.S. as a world power;</item>
                        <item>c. That the Soviets would be willing to accept any damage that we
                            could inflict upon them with our retaliatory capacity in the belief that
                            they could rebuild much faster than we could and be more successful than
                            we in maintaining internal control.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Taking these up in reverse order we find that, although differing in degree,
                        neither Assumption b. nor Assumption c. reflects what we know about the
                        Soviets and the bases of their actions. In Part I of the “reappraisal” it is
                        stated that “should the Soviets attain the capability of delivering a
                        ‘decisive’ initial blow on the U.S. <hi rend="italic">without serious risk
                            to their own regime,</hi> they would do so”—or, at any rate, that we
                        would have to assume that they would do so. It is also pointed out in Part I
                        that the major preoccupation of the Soviets is with internal security and
                        that they must consider any major war as “highly dangerous” to their regime.
                        That they would deliberately choose a course of action sure to result in
                        heavy atomic blows on their major centers with effects which neither they
                        nor we can accurately predict seems highly inconsistent with the
                        analysis.</p>
                    <p>Assumption a. and, to a certain extent, Assumption b., seems to ignore the
                        nature of our retaliatory power, the tremendous difficulty of destroying it,
                        the possibilities open to us of increasing that difficulty and, finally, the
                        decisions which the Soviets would be forced to make before they could
                        attempt to destroy it.</p>
                    <p>In the first place we must assume, at least until the contrary is
                        demonstrated, that we are now and will remain capable of doing greater
                        damage to the Soviet Union with atomic bombs than the Soviet Union can do to
                        the United States <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> the Soviets, by taking the
                        initiative, critically damage our retaliatory striking <pb xml:id="pg_16"
                            n="16" facs="0046"/>force <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it can be put
                        into action. But looking at our retaliatory striking force as a single
                        target system, what the Soviets must consider, if they plan to destroy it,
                        is the following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Air bases scattered over half the globe, some—although not a large
                            number at present—specifically designed for the purpose of launching
                            strategic bombers on combat missions, but many others which could, under
                            dire circumstances, be used for that purpose.</item>
                        <item>(2) Planes and crews which, if in the air, cannot be destroyed and
                            which, given a relatively short warning, can somehow or other get into
                            the air.</item>
                        <item>(3) A warning system which, in addition to a radar screen that can be
                            completed prior to the time that the Soviets obtain the minimum
                            capability necessary for the attempt at a decisive blow, includes the
                            fact that if all elements of this complicated target system are not hit
                            concurrently, the other elements will, <hi rend="italic">ipso
                                facto,</hi> be warned.</item>
                        <item>(4) Bombs which can be protected from destruction.</item>
                        <item>(5) Fuel which can either be protected from destruction or which can
                            in circumstances of dire emergency be obtained elsewhere than those
                            places designated by current plans.</item>
                        <item>(6) Potentialities for flexibility of employment of <gloss
                                target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> which must always leave the Soviets in
                            doubt as to how much of our striking force we could send against them if
                            they failed to knock out all of our bases and keep them knocked
                            out.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that we can maintain a position which
                        will indefinitely face the Soviets with the following as a comparable
                        dilemma: either that they throw all of their atomic power against ours with
                        the strong possibility of succeeding only in eliminating both atomic
                        capabilities, while starting a long war with U.S. industrial potential
                        largely undamaged; or face the probability of incalculable damage to the
                        Soviet home base as the price for rendering the U.S. incapable of a full
                        scale effort in a long war.</p>
                    <p>G. From the foregoing it can be concluded that it lies within our power for
                        the foreseeable future to prevent the Soviet Union from attaining the
                        capability of waging general war against the United States without serious
                        risk to the Soviet regime.</p>
                    <p>From what we know of the Soviets we can also conclude that it is unlikely, in
                        these circumstances, that they will deliberately initiate a general war
                        against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The essence of our national strategy, then, remains valid; and we can
                        continue to work toward our objectives with respect to the U.S.S.R. without
                        feeling the compulsion of achieving them by a certain date, “or else”.</p>
                    <p>Such is the nature of relations between the Communist and non-Communist
                        world, however, that general war is now, and will continue to be for the
                        foreseeable future, an ever-present possibility.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_17" n="17" facs="0047"/>
                    <p>Furthermore, we must assume that any general war will be sooner or later an
                        atomic war and that, as time goes on, damage to both sides in such a war
                        will be progressively more serious, and both general war and the threat
                        thereof less and less rewarding.</p>
                    <p>We cannot assume from this, however, that the Soviets will cease their
                        probing; nor that we must give up marking [<hi rend="italic">marching?</hi>]
                        toward our objectives. What does follow is that we must develop both a
                        greater willingness and a greater capacity for dealing with local peripheral
                        “cold war” situations than we have, as a nation, demonstrated to date.</p>

                        substantially represents my views.</p>
                    <p>The present tentative outline of the entire study calls for at least one

                    <p>There will be a preliminary Steering Committee meeting on this draft on

                        would therefore like to have your comments on the attached draft in my hands

                            >NSC</gloss> 114/2 and in the light of (1) Further analysis of Soviet

                            n="19" facs="0049"/>of another atomic bomb in the U.S.S.R., (2) the
                        current evaluation of the net capability of the U.S.S.R. to injure the
                        continental United States.”</p>
                    <p>2. There has been a further analysis of Soviet atomic capabilities, but the
                        project to arrive at a net evaluation of the net capability of the U.S.S.R.
                        to injure the continental United States has not yet been completed.
                        Nevertheless, the Steering Committee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Senior Staff decided that it was necessary to proceed on a
                        preliminary basis with the work called for by <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Action 575c.</p>
                    <p>3. The drafting committee has not had access to a large body of information
                        which relates directly and significantly to a reappraisal of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 and 114 policies. This includes
                        information relating to the atomic tests scheduled for this fall; to the
                        problem of civilian defense; to the tactical uses of atomic weapons; and to
                        accomplishments in the field of research and development which may greatly
                        affect both our defensive and offensive potentialities. Largely because of
                        its lack of access to this information but partly for other reasons which
                        are not self-evident, the present draft study is almost wholly irrelevant to
                        the major issues on which this Government must take decisions within the
                        coming months. It would be, in <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>’s opinion,
                        positively harmful for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to proceed
                        with the consideration of the present draft study with a view to its
                        eventual approval as a reappraisal of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68
                        and 114 policies.</p>
                    <p>4. The paper does not consider, for example, such questions as:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The risks associated with this fall’s atomic tests;</item>
                        <item>b. The implications—in terms of relative military strength—of
                            successful tests;</item>
                        <item>c. The exploitation of a radical shift in our favor in power
                            ratios;</item>
                        <item>d. The implications of the foregoing for political and military
                            policies;</item>
                        <item>e. A reconsideration in light of the above of our objectives in peace
                            and war and the conditions of a peaceful settlement;</item>
                        <item>f. The relation to the foregoing of the actual and potential strength
                            of our civilian defenses and of accomplishments in the field of research
                            and development.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>5. The paper also does not consider the relation of such specific problems as
                        Berlin and Germany, Iran, Indochina, and Korea to our general strategy, even
                        though much work has been going on through <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> channels which indicates that developments in such specific
                        situations may have a strong and perhaps decisive influence on the conduct
                        of our general strategy.</p>
                    <p>6. In light of the information available to it, <gloss target="#t_SP1"
                            >S/P</gloss> believes that the General Conclusions of the draft study
                        are inadequate, misleading in some respects, and inaccurate in others.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_20" n="20" facs="0050"/>
                    <p>7. In <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>’s opinion, there is a need for a
                        high-level review of national political-military strategy in the light of
                        developments since the completion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68
                        and foreseeable future developments. This review should be made by a group
                        having access to the relevant information. When <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68 was prepared, the State–Defense Working Group had very
                        little to go on and broke almost entirely new ground. Now there has been
                        much thought on many aspects of the problem and it is important for one
                        group to draw together all the bits and pieces in order to see what they add

                    <p>Top Secret</p>
                    <p>The following is a statement of the military program for fiscal 1953 as
                        approved by the President and submitted to Congress.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Objectives and Minimum Tasks which the Program is
                        designed to fulfill</p>
                    <p>1. The objectives of the Department of Defense program are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Protection against disaster; and</item>
                        <item>b. Support of our foreign policy.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the course of meeting these objectives, the Department of Defense program
                        is designed to provide, at the least possible cost in manpower and national
                        resources, a maximum deterrent to enemy aggression and, in case war occurs,
                        give the nation a reasonable assurance <pb xml:id="pg_22" n="22" facs="0052"
                        />of victory. However, imposed fiscal limitations will result in postponing
                        until 1956 the full realization of the United States military capabilities
                        originally planned for achievement in 1954.</p>
                    <p>2. In order to attain the above objectives, the forces listed herein are
                        intended to carry out on an austere basis the following approved basic
                        military tasks:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To provide a reasonable initial defense of the Western Hemisphere
                            and essential allied areas, particularly in Europe.</item>
                        <item>b. To provide a minimum mobilization base while offensive forces are
                            being developed.</item>
                        <item>c. To conduct initial air and sea offensive operations to destroy
                            vital elements of the enemy’s war-making capacity and to check enemy
                            offensive operations until allied offensive strength can be
                            developed.</item>
                        <item>d. To defend and maintain the lines of communications and base areas
                            necessary to the execution of the above tasks.</item>
                        <item>e. To provide aid to our allies to assist them in the execution of
                            their responsibilities.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. The major wartime tasks to be performed by the several Services, and the
                        timing and nature of the operations have generated the bases that have been
                        used for the development of the forces required.</p>
                    <p>a. Army and Navy forces, in view of their basic responsibilities, have been
                        developed on the basis of tasks as set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                    <p>b. Since the Air Force is responsible for the air defense of the United
                        States, by both defensive and offensive air operations, and since it is also
                        responsible for strategic air warfare (both tasks being D–Day tasks), the
                        forces of the Air Force have been developed to accomplish, under the basic
                        tasks listed in paragraph 2, the following Air Force missions, listed in
                        order of priority:</p>
                    <list>

                            critical areas in the Western Hemisphere, with particular emphasis on
                            defense against atomic attack.</item>
                        <item>(2) To conduct a strategic air offensive to destroy the vital elements
                            of Soviet war-making capacity.</item>
                        <item>(3) To assist in the direct defense of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        will be available for other elements of the active Army. This situation is
                        created primarily by heavy consumption of equipment and munitions in Korea

                    <p>The approved <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 active forces will be in
                        place and operational from 1 July 1952 (1 January 1953 for Marine Corps
                        forces) on, at manning levels which are the best attainable within the
                        budgeted personnel strengths and which will vary for different units from
                        about 85 per cent to full war strength. Currently programmed modernization
                        of the equipment of these active forces can be substantially completed with
                        the funds provided in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953
                        Presidential budget and prior appropriations. However, because of policy
                        decisions taken during the review of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1953 Budget Estimates, dictated in part by the necessity for holding <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 expenditures within prudent limits and
                        in part by the desirability of maintaining expansible production capacity
                        for an indefinite period of years, actual deliveries of modernizing
                        equipment will not in all cases be completed before 31 December 1954. As a
                        further result of the same policy decisions, the acquiring of mobilization
                        reserves has been extended through a longer period with maximum long-range
                        reliance placed upon the principles of industry capacity and production in
                        being. Training, both individual and organizational, will be emphasized
                        throughout <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. In summary, although
                        force levels remain constant, significant improvements in combat
                        effectiveness at those levels are anticipated.</p>

                    <p>b. If Korean hostilities do not end by 30 June 1952 it will be necessary for
                        the Department of Defense to utilize such funds as may be available to
                        support sustained hostilities. This may require the submission of a
                        supplemental appropriation request during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1953.</p>
                    <p>c. The build-up of the military program has been stretched out so as to be
                        accomplished within an expenditure limitation of $85.6 billion for the
                        18-month period from 1 January 1952 through 30 June 1953. This $85.6 billion
                        covers expenditures of Department of Defense funds and the military portion
                        of the Mutual Security Assistance Program. It reflects the Presidential
                        decision that expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 for
                        these programs should be less than $60 billion, and adds to this amount the
                        $25.6 billion half-year unexpended portion of the $43.3 billion of
                        expenditures estimated for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952. The funds
                        appropriated for military assistance will be utilized <pb xml:id="pg_28"
                            n="28" facs="0058"/>in such a manner as to permit the most advantageous
                        over-all production program which can be attained, taking into consideration
                        the combined needs of the U.S. forces and our allies.</p>
                    <p>d. Production goals for the current year remain about the same as previously
                        planned, and it will be necessary to double the output of hard goods and
                        construction during the year in order to achieve these goals. Production
                        rates during calendar year 1953 will be somewhat lower than the schedules
                        contemplated in 114/2. Under the present program, maintenance of production
                        on a high plateau will result in greater production subsequent to 1953 than
                        was previously scheduled and a correspondingly higher mobilization base in
                        the event of an emergency.</p>
                    <p>e. The obligational authority included in the cost table set forth in

                        War</p>
                    <p>1. The mobilization program, as it was originally conceived in late 1950 and
                        as it will continue into fiscal 1953, has been built on four concepts:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To attain current production rates of military equipment adequate
                            for American forces in being, to aid <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies and friendly nations in accordance with our
                            commitments, and to provide adequate military reserve stocks.</item>
                        <item>b. To develop carefully planned capacity for output of military
                            matériel in full-scale war, to be held in reserve either as idle
                            capacity in existing plants, as side-by-side plants with those now
                            active, or as dual-purpose plants used, prior to full hostilities, for
                            other products and readily convertible.</item>
                        <item>c. To expand our sources of materials, processing and fabricating
                            facilities, and basic industries so that a current program of military
                            production can be conducted alongside a normal civilian economy and so
                            that an enormously expanded military effort could be supported
                            immediately without waiting for further expansion of the industrial
                            base.</item>
                        <item>d. Consistent with the foregoing objectives, to maintain a healthy and
                            growing civilian economy as a valuable source of national strength to
                            meet the possible shock of full-scale war.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. These objectives, as formulated for the guidance of the Executive Branch,
                        have not been altered. Reconciliation of specific conflicts between the
                        objectives, the refinement of precise quantitative goals within each
                        objective, and pressing for the accomplishment of these goals, have required
                        and will require the bulk of the mobilization agencies’ efforts in fiscal
                        1953.</p>
                    <p>3. The term “mobilization base” includes both the second and third
                        objectives, and “industrial base” the third only. In this discussion the
                        term “military matériel mobilization base” will be used to describe the
                        second objective. “Industrial base” will be used in discussing the third
                        objective. In fiscal 1953 the distinction will become of greater importance
                        because the problems involved in attaining selectively the two objectives
                        will be more clearly separable than in the first eighteen or twenty months
                        of simultaneous and rapid pushing ahead on many fronts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Current Military Production</p>
                    <p>4. In terms of the planned military strength in the United States and in
                        other countries of the free world, particularly in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_30" n="30" facs="0060"/>area, the flow of many items of
                        current munitions production (the first objective above) is not yet great
                        enough. Production of particular items will attain the rate necessary and
                        level off at various times, and new models will of course always be coming
                        in. For the program as a whole, expenditures should level off at the end of
                        calendar 1952 and continue level at least two years.</p>
                    <p>5. In determining the point to which expenditure rates should be raised a
                        choice was involved between short-range and long-range strength. It was
                        necessary to decide on a position on a range between two extremes. One
                        extreme would be to build up strictly military strength as fast as possible
                        by freezing the models and techniques and pouring out today’s arms today
                        even though many categories would rapidly become obsolescent. The other
                        extreme would be to minimize current production. An intermediate position
                        would be a broader and more sustained build-up of current output while
                        concentrating on research, development, and the mobilization base. We would
                        then concurrently be producing substantial amounts of equipment, developing
                        our resources, our techniques, and our production lines for the newer
                        weapons of the future, and keeping our civilian economy as strong as
                        possible for the long pull.</p>
                    <p>6. Because we and other free nations were girding to defend ourselves, not to
                        attack others, we knew we could not choose the day on which our stock of
                        weapons would be put to test—nor can we now.</p>
                    <p>7. Therefore, the nation must be strong against an attack which may come at
                        any time over an indefinite future. With such an outlook, our best defense
                        program has seemed to be one of moderate production of current weapons, a
                        continued development of the newer and better weapons, and creator of
                        greater resources and more effective production lines, all at levels which a
                        healthy civilian economy can build and sustain as a long-range program. We
                        have thus placed emphasis on the intermediate position, even though it
                        entails a calculated risk.</p>
                    <p>8. The result is a production plateau to extend through 1953 and 1954.
                        Through most of fiscal year 1953, however, we must continue to push ahead to
                        achieve the levels required by this “plateau”. Toward the end of the fiscal
                        year 1953 the monthly rate for deliveries and construction put in place is
                        expected to rise to about $3.5 billion. (The rate was $2.4 billion in March
                        1952). For hard goods only, the monthly rate is expected to increase from
                        $1.8 billion in March 1952 to about $3.0 billion early in calendar year
                        1953.</p>
                    <p>9. Nevertheless, on some items, we are already facing the problem of how to
                        schedule continued production to meet the requirements resulting from
                        obsolescence and the need for replacement. <pb xml:id="pg_31" n="31"
                            facs="0061"/>For the program as a whole, obsolescence caused by
                        technological advances in matériel could become (probably early in fiscal
                        year 1954) the primary determinant of future production needs. The date of
                        the turning point—from buildup to maintenance—may depend on policy
                        determinations not yet made.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Attaining an Adequate Military Matériel
                        Mobilization Base</p>
                    <p>10. Outbreak of full-scale war would require rapid expansion of production of
                        military matériel above the rate to be reached in a period of partial
                        mobilization. As our current production nears a plateau, increasing
                        attention must be given during 1953 to making ready added production
                        capacity for military end-items beyond current armament needs, as a
                        protection in case of full-scale war. Careful planning, initiative in
                        action, and substantial direct and indirect financial assistance must be the
                        function of government in the attainment of the second objective.</p>
                    <p>11. Development and maintenance of standby or readily convertible capacity is
                        a necessary but not sufficient step in preparedness. The capacity must be
                        supported by a broadening and strengthening of our general industrial base
                        on which it must rely for raw materials, additional facilities, and, indeed,
                        manpower with the necessary skills and experience. The government’s function
                        in all of this latter area is largely general guidance and direction.</p>
                    <p>12. The development of standby, partially utilized, or readily convertible
                        capacity for direct military production involves special problems,
                        techniques, and costs to the government not met in expanding and maintaining
                        the general industrial base in an economy operating at a high and expanding
                        rate such as we have had since 1950.</p>
                    <p>13. Planning for the military matériel mobilization base is only now getting
                        under way. Both planning and action must be accelerated during 1953. The
                        U.S. base must be reviewed in relation to current and future efforts to
                        develop munitions production in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries and in other areas.</p>
                    <p>14. Following are some examples of current planning for the military matériel
                        mobilization base. The Air Force had computed, as of early 1952, that a
                        monthly production rate of 86 million airframe weight pounds is required
                        under full mobilization to sustain all-out efforts in global war. This
                        compares with a maximum production rate of 21 million pounds under the
                        current schedule. Production for partial mobilization will in the main be on
                        a one-shift basis. A large part of the increased capacity for full-scale war
                        would be the result of moving to a three-shift operation. The Air Force
                        proposes to arrange the needed additional capacity in three types of plant:
                        (1) plants which are partly devoted to civilian production; <pb
                            xml:id="pg_32" n="32" facs="0062"/>(2) separate plants adjacent to
                        civilian production plants; and (3) independent plants not used for civilian
                        production. From 15 to 20 plants are in each category. Contractors are being
                        asked to specify their tool requirements for such plants and to estimate the
                        cost. Obviously, however, initial tool costs represent only one segment of
                        the cost and planning problem involved in maintenance of this standby
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>15. The problem of what kind of supplementary industrial capacity to develop
                        is illustrated by the example of the hull of the M–48 tank. Capacity is
                        approved or proposed for only half the planned rate of 2, 150 a month. Plant
                        construction has been delayed until further tests on an eleven-piece hull to
                        replace the one-piece hull have been made.</p>
                    <p>16. Mobilization agencies in accelerating planning and action in developing
                        the military matériel mobilization base in 1953 will seek:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. to foster parallel and integrated planning action by the armed
                            services.</item>
                        <item>b. to develop facilities suitable for a rapid change to three-shift
                            operations while meeting current requirements by one-shift or other
                            types of reduced operation.</item>
                        <item>c. to give particular attention to the manpower and training problem
                            required for a rapid expansion of production both by adding shifts and
                            utilizing the standby capacity.</item>
                        <item>d. to acquire or assist industry in acquiring a reserve of machine
                            tools and other production equipment needed for shift expansion or
                            conversion. Particular attention must also be given to the replacement
                            and modernization of tools as it affects the expanded operations.</item>
                        <item>e. to assist in developing techniques for maintaining the military
                            matériel mobilization base at maximum readiness; that is, in such
                            condition that full production of military requirements may be obtained
                            within the time that military reserve stocks would be consumed so that
                            tactical operations will not be delayed for want of matériel.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>17. In some areas of the economy, actions to achieve the desired military
                        matériel base (second objective) merge into efforts to achieve the
                        industrial base (third objective). The machine tool industry is a case in
                        point. In World War II, and again in this emergency, military production
                        waited while machine tools were designed and ordered and the industry geared
                        up to the needs of military production.</p>
                    <p>18. To avoid such delay in the future, two things are necessary. Tools must
                        be on hand and the tool industry must also be kept operating at a moderately
                        high level. The problem is immediate because the backlog of orders for some
                        tools is beginning to decline. The point at which this decline should be
                        checked and stabilized <pb xml:id="pg_33" n="33" facs="0063"/>must be
                        determined. The initial step is a calculation of specific and realistic
                        requirements by the military services and by important contractors, who have
                        the primary responsibility for identifying the tools that will be needed in
                        full-scale war. Continuing civilian requirements, availability of existing
                        machine tools in the economy, and government-owned reserves, must be taken
                        into consideration. Provision must be made in military budgets for the
                        initial slice where that has not already been done. Congress, industry
                        executives and the public must understand the difficult long-run objectives
                        of the program and be ready to accept and support the necessary cost.
                        Finally, orders must be placed on a realistic basis of needs, and assurances
                        given of their firmness. The machine tool industry is only one of several
                        industries for which rather specific support may need to be given in the
                        coming years to sustain production somewhat above that required by the
                        current demands for the defense build-up and the civilian economy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Attaining an Adequate Industrial Base</p>
                    <p>19. The over-all industrial capacity of the United States is the foundation
                        on which current military production and the military matériel mobilization
                        base, as well as a healthy civilian economy, must jointly rest. This
                        capacity was twice as high early in 1952 as it was in 1940. Even more
                        important, a large part of this expansion in the great basic industries has
                        been accomplished since 1945. A major remaining task of the mobilization
                        program is to supplement the enormous expansion which has already taken
                        place. Private industries’ own capital has provided all but a small part of
                        the total expansion. This will continue to be true. Guidance and direction
                        is the function of government in developing an industrial structure capable
                        of supporting a full war effort (the third objective) leaving until the
                        actual war period only those minimum emergency additions which the
                        indeterminate nature of certain full war requirements makes necessary.</p>
                    <p>20. Expenditures for new plant and equipment in 1951 were at a high level.
                        While capital outlays in almost all manufacturing industry rose from 1950 to
                        1951, the increases were substantially greater among the defense-related
                        industries. Certain of the defense-related industries, such as chemicals,
                        electric power, and metals, are scheduling even greater capital outlays in
                        the coming fiscal year. These actions are in accord with mobilization
                        program objectives.</p>
                    <p>21. Two major tools have been used to channel the enormous flow of private
                        capital in the directions desired. One has been the authority originally
                        granted in the Defense Production Act of 1950, to permit an accelerated
                        amortization of facilities in the determination <pb xml:id="pg_34" n="34"
                            facs="0064"/>of tax liability.<note n="§§" xml:id="d10fn-sym4">Outlays
                            under certificate are currently running at over 30 percent of the
                            country’s total investment by manufacturers in new plants and equipment.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> This permission to amortize the
                        cost of added facilities in five years, instead of the ten to twenty-five or
                        more years normally permitted under the corporate tax laws, may operate as a
                        powerful inducement to make decisions to invest in new facilities. If the
                        new facility will have maximum usefulness and earning power during the five
                        years, the total tax liability for earnings from the investment during its
                        life may be lessened. On the other hand, if the new facility continues to
                        have earning power after the expiration of the five-year period throughout
                        its normal physical life, total tax payments may be little altered, since
                        payments in later years would be proportionately larger in the absence of
                        the normal depreciation deduction. However, a future but real inducement to
                        private corporate investors in new plants and facilities is the possibility
                        that prescribed corporate tax rates may be lower after 1956 or 1957; in that
                        event, the five-year write-off would become particularly attractive.</p>
                    <p>22. Actually, the rapid amortization of new investment over the five-year
                        period has operated to induce additions to capacity to an unexpectedly high
                            degree.<note n="║║" xml:id="d10fn-sym10">As of May 1, 1952, the total
                            value of industrial investment thus aided exceeded $19.5 billion.
                            Another $7.0 billion in applications were pending at that time. The
                            Treasury is now preparing more detailed estimates of the “cost” of the
                            rapid amortization program, in terms of lowered revenue. However, rough
                            calculations, based on the value of certificates issued as of the end of
                            the month of March 1952, show a probable revenue loss of $600 million
                            this fiscal year (1952) and $1 billion loss in each of the next several
                            years, up to perhaps five years. Varying certain assumptions in such a
                            calculation can alter the results substantially. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>23. There is thus a major responsibility to make any additional grants
                        effective in attaining the correct proportions of added capacity over the
                        whole range of American industries. This necessitates the establishment of
                        balanced expansion goals. The Defense Production Administration will be
                        actively engaged in fiscal year 1953 in the task of adjusting and approving
                        expansion objectives. This task cannot be fully completed in the sense of
                        covering each of hundreds of industrial segments. Such determinations of the
                        objectives for expansion are made in cooperation with other government
                        agencies, and after consultation with industry.<note n="¶¶"
                            xml:id="d10fn-sym6">Expansion goals to be reached between 1953 and 1955
                            have been established by DPA for just under 100 major commodities and
                            products. Important commodities for which goals have been set include
                            steel, pig iron, manganese, chrome, lead, and a number of nonferrous
                            metals. Aluminum, copper, and numerous other commodities are still under
                            study. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>24. A second helpful tool of government, useful in guiding the rate and
                        direction of expansion, is the quarterly allocation of materials <pb
                            xml:id="pg_35" n="35" facs="0065"/>going into industrial construction.
                        This will also be used in the light of balanced expansion goals as those are
                        established. As materials controls become less of a limiting factor on
                        private industrial planning and actual construction, this tool will be
                        dulled.</p>
                    <p>25. Some of the expansions planned by American industries in the next three
                        years are very large. To a considerable degree they represent capacity
                        sufficient to support a future war economy on the one hand, and on the other
                        to support the current output of munitions, new capital investment in tools
                        and equipment, and the requirements of a healthy civilian economy in the
                        absence of full hostilities. The higher of these two requirements is
                        theoretically controlling in determining an expansion goal. Except for some
                        critical raw materials, official Defense full war requirements are often not
                        available, and goals tend to be based on requirements of partial
                        mobilization plus a high level of civilian activity, rather than full
                        war.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Healthy Civilian Economy</p>
                    <p>26. The fourth objective of the mobilization program encompasses achieving
                        the other three while at the same time maintaining a healthy and growing
                        civilian economy as a valuable source of national strength.</p>
                    <p>27. The present security program is large, but the strain on the economy
                        caused by the program so far has been surprisingly small. Though the impact
                        in the coming fiscal year will be larger, it is well within our economic
                        capabilities. Actually, a larger program would be economically feasible if
                        it were militarily desirable and if political and public support for larger
                        military appropriations could be developed.</p>
                    <p>28. Since the beginning of the mobilization effort, total gross national
                        product has increased more than have governmental security expenditures.
                        Through 1953 this relationship is likely to continue. Moreover, if total
                        private investment declines as seems possible, more output will be available
                        for personal consumption. Consumer expenditures in 1951, measured in real
                        terms, were only slightly lower than in 1950, but higher than any other
                        recent year. This decline was only partly, if at all, the result of
                        shortages since the demand for many commodities did not keep up with
                        output.</p>
                    <p>29. The requirements of the defense program, however, did noticeably affect
                        some segments of the economy in 1951. Housing starts declined, less
                        essential civilian construction fell, and passenger cars and other consumer
                        durable goods production was reduced. Credit and other anti-inflationary
                        controls and materials shortages were partially responsible for this decline
                        but falling off in demand also played a part. Rising military requirements
                        for materials, <pb xml:id="pg_36" n="36" facs="0066"/>as well as for
                        defense-supporting industries, made necessary, during the first quarter of
                        calendar 1952, contractions in the output of consumer durable goods, and, in
                        some instances, public and private investment, but significant expansion
                        will be possible in the second and third quarters barring severe strike
                        losses.</p>
                    <p>30. With the expansion of total output, as well as that for key materials
                        expected in the next two years, consumer supplies can, in general, expand
                        beyond any levels previously reached in this country. Such temporary
                        curtailments in limited areas as may be necessary will not involve
                        sacrifices for the general public which can be regarded as severe measured
                        by levels of consumption in 1948–51.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Expanding Production of Raw Materials</p>
                    <p>31. Underlying all four objectives is the need to provide assured sources of
                        all essential raw materials. The United States is, in whole or in part,
                        dependent upon sources outside its continental boundaries for many key
                        materials—iron ore, manganese, petroleum, wood pulp, natural rubber,
                        industrial diamonds, nickel and certain other alloying metals, copper, zinc,
                        and lead, fibres, and some staple foodstuffs. For some materials, there
                        simply is not enough in the whole free world to meet an unrestrained U.S.
                        demand, including a satisfactory rate of stockpile building. Congress has
                        provided authority in the Defense Production Act for a program of expansion.
                        The program has been developed and is being carried out. When it is
                        completed, it should take care of all but a few problems of shortages.
                        However, shortages of many metals will last through calendar year 1952 and
                        to a lesser degree into 1953, and in some cases it will be 1955 or beyond
                        before requirements are met (i.e., nickel and certain other alloying
                        metals). For a few commodities, such as copper, unrestricted requirements
                        may continue to exceed supply for two or three years, although essential
                        requirements may be met in the latter part of the current year. There will
                        be no single date on which all shortages will be ended.</p>
                    <p>32. Major responsibility for implementation of materials expansion rests in
                        the hands of private producers, both at home and abroad. Success of
                        government efforts to extend the scope of exploration, the construction of
                        new mining or processing facilities, and the immediate supply from existing
                        sources depends heavily on the actions of private producers. Government
                        stimulation is provided mainly through accelerated tax amortization,
                        long-term contracts guaranteeing “floor” prices, grants for exploration,
                        direct purchases of high-cost output for the stockpile and
                        purchase-and-resale-at-loss operations in particular commodities. Increased
                        emphasis is being and must be given to the expansion of secure foreign <pb
                            xml:id="pg_37" n="37" facs="0067"/>sources of supply by both private and
                        governmental undertakings in order that the U.S. may meet its requirements
                        for raw materials in the years ahead. Budget funds required are primarily
                        working capital for the purchase and resale operations, which may or may not
                        result in actual losses.<note n="*" xml:id="d10fn-sym1">For fiscal 1953, an

                            addition to the existing borrowing authority of $2.1 billion. Ultimate
                            costs to date of the total expansion program are estimated at only $200
                            million, but a much larger sum is tied up in working capital funds.

                    <p>33. To meet the four objectives of the present mobilization plan, larger
                        amounts of some materials may be required, paradoxically, than under full
                        war conditions. Sharp reductions in wartime civilian usage could bring this
                        result. In other cases, however, the opposite would occur and demand would
                        sharply increase. In these latter cases, conservation and substitution
                        measures are crucial. Balancing the alternative of conservation
                        possibilities with the concept of ready-but-not-currently-used facilities to
                        increase output after war began (thus treating the problem as part of the
                        second objective) will remain a key problem in planning for this group of
                        materials during 1953.</p>
                    <p>34. Achievement of a satisfactory position in several materials, for which
                        known and potential free world sources are inadequate under conditions of
                        either defense mobilization or full war, requires efforts to channel demand
                        away either by substitution or other materials (which may either be more
                        expensive or technologically unfamiliar), or by conservation, i.e., use of
                        smaller quantities to achieve the same results. Those cases where the
                        current supply is reasonably adequate but long-run balance is doubtful, or
                        where supply is inadequate under either situation, will receive major
                        attention during the coming year.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Guidance in the Distribution of Materials</p>
                    <p>35. To sustain day-to-day progress in the attainment of the four mobilization
                        objectives, some government guidance is needed over the flow of materials,
                        to meet current consumption needs, stockpile goals, and construction
                        requirements. The Defense Production Administration is charged with basic
                        responsibility for guiding the use of resources in the economy, and
                        especially of the materials which have a central controlling role in the
                        direction, volume, and pace of industrial output and of the expansion of
                        facilities. In carrying out this responsibility, DPA has followed the policy
                        that the determination of the security needs of the nation is a matter for
                        the Department of Defense, and that the task of the mobilization agencies is
                        to meet the material requirements of that program. In the event <pb
                            xml:id="pg_38" n="38" facs="0068"/>those requirements are so large as to
                        interfere very seriously with essential industrial programs, the question
                        would be taken to the President as to whether military or industrial needs
                        would be cut.</p>
                    <p>36. So long as military demand plus the needs of the stockpile requires the
                        diversion from civilian use of a substantial percentage of the total supply
                        of particular materials the government must take responsibility for control.
                        There are three reasons for this:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. There must be assurance that military needs are met. This is a
                            relatively simple problem, once the program is determined, since
                            military orders are readily identified for preferential
                            treatment.</item>
                        <item>b. There must be assurance that defense-supporting and essential
                            civilian needs also are met. This is a complex problem involving the
                            maintenance and expansion of industry, the stockpile, the materials
                            sources themselves, the agricultural base, and the transportation and
                            communication services.</item>
                        <item>c. There must be a fair division of the remaining supply among less
                            essential needs. This is a difficult problem in reconciling clashing
                            interests, and the Government must perforce take primary responsibility
                            for its solution.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>37. Because of the easing of the materials situation in the Spring of 1952,
                        consideration has been given in consultation with industry and claimant
                        agencies to the future relaxation of the Controlled Materials Plan, which
                        governs the distribution of steel, aluminum and copper. Top priority for
                        essential defense projects would still be retained. The intention otherwise
                        is to remove the demand-control aspect of CMP to the maximum extent
                        possible, but to maintain standby control machinery ready for future use if
                        needed. Maintenance of the control function as such is dependent upon
                        extension, beyond June 30, 1952, of the necessary authority from
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>38. In addition to the controls exercised on the three commodities through
                        CMP, the Government intervenes in a wide range of other commodities to
                        insure their proper allocation, conservation and end-use. This is
                        particularly important for the nonferrous metals which will continue to be
                        in short supply.</p>
                    <p>39. <hi rend="italic">Stockpiling</hi>—The development of a national
                        stockpile is partially dependent upon the authority for general control over
                        the flow of materials. The policy is now established that controls will not
                        be completely abandoned in any case until stockpile needs are met.</p>
                    <p>40. Building war-reserve stocks of key materials, owned directly by the
                        Government, rests on the assumption that supply sources outside the United
                        States during full war would be subject to loss or crippling by enemy
                        action, or that these sources plus domestic sources of supply in a full war
                        period would be inadequate to meet enlarged demands. The stockpiling program
                        of the Munitions Board antedates the 1950–52 mobilization effort. (The
                        status of the <pb xml:id="pg_39" n="39" facs="0069"/>stockpile is covered in
                        the summary statement on the National Stockpiling Program (No. 5) below.)
                        The stockpile goals will be given thorough review in the coming year,
                        particularly to define various levels of urgency, to eliminate some
                        materials, and to emphasize the particular materials where expansion or
                        purchase programs should be stepped up.</p>
                    <p>41. In this review the “rating band” to which a strategic and critical
                        material is assigned will reflect a judgment as to the supply position that
                        would exist should total war come in January 1953. After the materials have
                        been assigned to agreed rating bands, determination of the action to be
                        taken beyond present expansion or controlled measures will be made. It is
                        anticipated that these actions may include extra-ordinary programs to expand
                        supplies, development of transportation facilities, encouragement of
                        construction of additional processing facilities to prevent disruption of
                        supply through destruction of one of the limited number of present
                        facilities. The Defense Production Administration will be charged with
                        responsibility to see that there is implementation of the action
                        recommendations.</p>
                    <p>42. How the four objectives of the program are balanced has been strikingly
                        illustrated in the management of the current purchasing for stockpiles in
                        the past eighteen months. Where necessary to bolster current supply,
                        particularly to permit carrying out expansion programs for new munitions
                        facilities (the second objective) and for additions to the industrial base
                        (the third objective), current output of some materials destined for the
                        stockpile has been diverted to current consumption. In other instances,
                        materials actually in stockpile have been released. The maintenance of a
                        healthy civilian economy (the fourth objective) has also been taken into
                        consideration in these decisions.</p>
                    <p>43. <hi rend="italic">International Action to Meet Defense Needs for Raw
                            Materials</hi>—It became clear, shortly after the outbreak of
                        hostilities in Korea, that some action in the international sphere was
                        called for to support national efforts to channel the flow of scarce
                        materials to defense and essential civilian needs. In early 1951, the
                        International Materials Conference, (consisting of seven commodity
                        committees, a central group, and a staff) was established. The raw materials
                        selected for coverage by the commodity committees were those which required
                        immediate attention because of the widespread need for them and the great
                        apparent shortage. The seven committees are as follows: Copper-lead-zinc;
                        Cotton-cotton linters; Manganese-nickel-cobalt; Pulp-paper; Sulphur;
                        Tungsten-molybdenum; and Wool.</p>
                    <p>44. The first task of the committees was to review the facts of supply and
                        demand. The second task of the committees was to determine <pb
                            xml:id="pg_40" n="40" facs="0070"/>what, if any, action should be
                        recommended to governments to alleviate the difficulties revealed by a
                        review of the facts.</p>
                    <p>45. In a number of cases the facts revealed such a disparity between
                        available supplies and the requirements of the free world for defense and
                        essential civilian purposes that the committees recommended distribution
                        according to defense and essential civilian requirements. Sulphur, tungsten
                        and molybdenum, copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt were thus recommended for
                        allocation. These allocations are renegotiated periodically, usually quarter
                        by quarter.</p>
                    <p>46. Other commodities studied by the committees were not recommended for
                        allocation. Supply and demand in lead and manganese were judged to be about
                        in balance; cotton and cotton linters, while in short supply last year, are
                        now expected to be much easier; the Wool Committee did not agree on the
                        scope of the wool shortage, nor on steps to alleviate it. The Pulp and Paper
                        Committee has recommended small emergency allocations of newsprint to help
                        the press of many countries of the free world continue in operation, but no
                        over-all allocation of newsprint or pulp has been recommended.</p>
                    <p>47. The share of world supply recommended for the United States has, in every
                        case, corresponded closely with the share the United States secured for
                        itself in the days of free competition for supplies in the years 1948, 1949,
                        and 1950. At the same time, the general acceptance by the governments
                        involved of IMC allocation recommendations has helped to check what might
                        have been runaway price increases in the short materials.</p>
                    <p>48. It seems clear that efforts to solve problems of shortage or surplus in
                        raw materials must be developed on a basis of genuinely effective
                        cooperation among a fairly large number of sovereign states and their
                        industries. If such cooperation had not been developed, countries might have
                        bargained the raw materials they held or controlled against the raw
                        materials and manufactured goods they needed; but to do this on a narrow
                        bilateral basis would have led only to holding back supplies, reducing
                        levels of production and increasing international animosity. Instead of
                        trading one specific commodity or resource against another, countries must
                        “trade” all commodities in general cooperation for the defense of the free
                        world. Leadership by the United States in supporting this principle will
                        continue to be of prime importance in obtaining a fair share of the free
                        world’s raw materials for the U.S. and in bolstering public support for
                        mobilization in allied or friendly countries of the free world.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_41" n="41" facs="0071"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Manpower</p>
                    <p>49. A primary problem in the manpower field in fiscal year 1953 will continue
                        to be an accurate assessment of manpower requirements and supply for a
                        mobilization program of varying size and for full war. Under current plans
                        the active strength of the armed forces will increase by about 100, 000 to
                        3.7 million men at the end of fiscal 1953. This further augmentation will
                        not have a serious impact on the size of the civilian labor force.
                        Furthermore, by the second quarter of fiscal 1953, the number of soldiers
                        returning to the civilian labor force is expected very nearly to equal the
                        number of men entering the armed forces. Thus, under the mobilization
                        program currently scheduled, it may be said that the worst impact on the
                        civilian economy of manpower withdrawals for the armed forces has already
                        been felt. Civilian employment including non-defense and defense employment
                        which is now over 61, 000, 000 will rise to between 62, 000, 000 and 63,
                        000, 000 in fiscal 1953. Civilian employment in defense industries will rise
                        to over 7 million. Barring significant changes in the active strength levels
                        of the armed forces and given the gradual acceleration of the defense
                        production program in fiscal 1953, manpower resources appear to be adequate
                        to meet both civilian and military needs during the year.</p>
                    <p>50. As time passes the increasing number of men who have been released from
                        the services will swell the reserve forces. This could result in a situation
                        where the main initial complements for expansion of forces in full war would
                        be subject to direct call by the military. Thus it is important that a sound
                        reserve call-up policy be developed which will recognize fully the civilian
                        requirements for manning defense industries in full war.</p>
                    <p>51. The development of a military material mobilization base (second
                        objective) will also require detailed planning to insure manpower needs can
                        be met in both partial and full mobilization. Ideally, the second
                        objective—literally achieved—would result in creation of a standby pool of
                        skilled employees, trained and ready to step into the expanded production
                        lines of a war economy. This is impossible policywise since it would
                        necessitate idling of many employables for an indefinite period.
                        Encouragement of specialized training programs for workers is a partial
                        answer. Extensive knowledge of available skills potentially transferable
                        from current employment also is a partial answer. Experimentation with the
                        most effective short-period training methods is another.</p>
                    <p>52. Planning for future manpower needs, plus wide publicity for the resulting
                        aims and plans, will continue in 1953 as a major preoccupation of the
                        manpower agencies.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IX. Stabilization of Prices and Wages</p>
                    <p>53. All four of the basic objectives are affected, and their success
                        conditioned, by money costs. Cost-price increases could seriously handicap
                        the immediate procurement program since they would in effect reduce
                        Congressional appropriations and would also impair production incentives.
                        Similarly, inflation could slow down the creation of the mobilization and
                        industrial base by disrupting investment plans which are derived from
                        multiple decisions made by private concerns.</p>
                    <p>54. After Korea, a speculative boom skyrocketed prices to very high levels;
                        although wages lagged somewhat, they also rose rapidly. In January 1951,
                        after it was recognized that monetary and fiscal controls were inadequate,
                        direct controls were imposed. From that time retail prices remained
                        relatively stable until September 1951 when they rose again slightly until
                        February 1952, followed again by a slight drop. Wholesale prices, being more
                        sensitive in reflecting speculative pressures, fell steadily from March 1951
                        to April 1952. Wages have risen steadily since Korea and have not shown
                        signs of weakness as yet. However, average weekly hours in manufacturing
                        have declined. Unemployment is still at exceedingly low levels, so that
                        consumers’ disposable income has been maintained at a high level.</p>
                    <p>55. It is anticipated that in the absence of a further speculative buying
                        crisis, the trend toward weakness which has developed in some markets will
                        continue; but strong price pressures on industrial materials and fabricated
                        products will also continue for the balance of fiscal 1953 and probably as
                        long as military spending and private investment remain at presently
                        projected high levels. Wages will probably continue to rise moderately.</p>
                    <p>56. When the decision to impose direct price and wage control was made and
                        the general freeze instituted early in 1951, the price and wage structures
                        had been badly distorted by the sudden speculative boom. The first task was
                        to smooth out the imbalances at the lowest levels that were fair and
                        equitable. This involved some rollbacks as well as some increases. In areas
                        where that process is complete we have attempted to hold the line, except in
                        cases of hardship, within general standards established to measure the merit
                        of requests for ceiling increases. While these standards do not need to be
                        and are not as rigorous as they were in full war, it is necessary that they
                        be established at some level and held consistently in order to assure that
                        no industry or business group gets special treatment.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_43" n="43" facs="0073"/>
                    <p>57. The standards developed to date include the “industry earnings standard”,
                        the “product standard”, and the “essential supply” standard.</p>
                    <p>58. The industry earnings standard allows industry-wide price relief when the
                        earnings to net worth ratio of an industry falls below 85% of that ratio in
                        the three best years during the period 1946–1949. This standard uses the
                        excess profits tax test and says essentially that so long as an industry as
                        a whole is in the excess profits tax bracket it shall not be entitled to
                        price relief. In the spring of 1952, this standard became an issue in the
                        steel cases where it resulted in denial of ceiling increase requests which
                        were made as a result of the wage increase recommended by the Wage
                        Stabilization Board. The standard has been attacked on the ground that it
                        does not allow sufficient incentive in cases where large expansion is
                        desired and necessary and also that it applies a rigid dollar test to
                        stockholder earnings in a situation where farmers and labor both are on
                        escalators which allow increases with the cost of living and in the case of
                        labor may also include an annual “improvement” addition to wages.</p>
                    <p>59. The product standard is designed to assure that no industry is forced
                        below the break-even point in producing a particular product line. The
                        essential supply standard is rarely used but can be applied to justify price
                        ceiling increases where necessary to insure supply which is essential to the
                        national defense.</p>
                    <p>60. Requests for wage increases are considered within the framework of
                        several criteria. Under present policies wage increases are limited to
                        compensation required because of increases in cost of living, correction of
                        inequities in pay scales, operation of merit and length of service systems,
                        establishment of health and welfare plans on a limited scale, and
                        recruitment of workers into defense industries. The increases required by
                        increased productivity or annual improvement clauses have also been approved
                        where they existed before controls. A policy to allow annual improvements in
                        new contracts may be approved in fiscal year 1953 or perhaps earlier.<note

                            <p>In a recent major dispute in the oil industry, the Wage Stabilization
                                Board recommended something more than could be justified under the
                                specific wage policies established heretofore. It was made on the
                                ground that it was “fair, equitable and not unstabilizing.” It
                                should be noted that in its disputes function the Board has not been
                                required to keep within established specific policies.</p>
                            <p>The oil recommendation taken together with that in steel will

                                industry that every case must be considered separately on its own
                                merits and only after the fullest free collective bargaining

                    <p>61. Since institutional factors of great complexity increase the difficulty
                        of reducing wages to reflect possible price declines, serious profit
                        squeezes can be anticipated during fiscal 1953.</p>
                    <p>62. Credit control measures taken to date include the Voluntary Credit
                        Restraint Program which aimed at reducing credit expansion in the
                        non-defense areas, and Regulations X and W which applied restraints on
                        housing and consumer durables credit. In response to the softening markets
                        in the Spring of 1952, in many construction materials and most consumer
                        durables, the Voluntary Credit Restraint Program and Regulation W have been
                        put on a standby basis.</p>
                    <p>63. The softness in some markets has also been reflected in the price control
                        program by the development of a price ceiling-suspension policy. Its purpose
                        will be to keep price controls flexible enough for the presently mixed and
                        changing market situation. Ceiling suspension action will be taken where the
                        market price is “materially below” ceiling and there is no prospect of a
                        need to reimpose the control in the near future.</p>
                    <p>64. Stabilization activity in fiscal 1953 will center around developing
                        further policy with reference to (a) the market softness which probably will
                        continue, (b) the rising level of wages and its accompanying effect on
                        profits and incentives for investment, and (c) changes in monetary and
                        fiscal measures which may be required by changes in the total economic
                        situation.</p>

                    <p>65. An integral part of future mobilization and defense planning will be the
                        problems of potential damage to industrial and economic capacity under war
                        conditions. This is a new element in American planning, as compared with the
                        two World Wars. Calculation of claims upon scarce resources during future
                        hostilities must include the potential drain of enemy-inflicted damage.</p>
                    <p>66. During fiscal year 1953, there will be a growing emphasis on this segment
                        of mobilization planning, under the leadership of <gloss target="#t_NSRB1"
                            >NSRB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and the National
                        Security Council. The Council itself has already taken action in one portion
                        of this area through its Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security,
                        which is concerned, among other things, with preattack security and problems
                        of sabotage and personnel risks. Another portion is the “emergency phase”
                        planning and nationwide organization under <gloss target="#t_FCDA1"
                            >FCDA</gloss>, which is also concerned with a number of preventive and
                        damage-reducing measures. Its work is discussed in summary statement on the
                        Federal Civil Defense Program (No. 4) below. A final area of necessary
                        planning and forethought will be the rehabilitation burden following upon
                        attacks, once the immediate emergency phase of an <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45"
                            facs="0075"/>attack has passed. Active development of these phases of
                        the mobilization program will involve a new phase of consultation with
                        communities, industry groups, and local governmental units in the coming
                        year. Here also the problem is not primarily one of current budget
                        appropriations by Congress (except for important portions of <gloss
                            target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> activity), but of integration of effort
                        between private industries or services, local communities and governments,
                        and the appropriate Federal agencies.</p>

                        Support the Mobilization Program</p>
                    <p>67. Just over 1.1 billion dollars in new obligational authority is being
                        requested in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 to finance the
                        mobilization program (see Table I). The great bulk of the funds requested
                        ($900, 000, 000) is to increase the borrowing authority of DPA required to
                        continue the expansion and purchase-sale programs being administered by DPA,
                            <gloss target="#t_DMPA1">DMPA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_RFC1"
                            >RFC</gloss>, and the Department of Agriculture. Since some of this
                        amount is for working capital needed in purchase and resale programs, net
                        expenditure may ultimately be much less. A significant fraction is for
                        administrative expenses of the mobilization agencies.</p>
                    <p>65. This authority plus related new obligation requests for mobilization
                        activities in 1953 total 1.5 billion. This excludes expenditures by the

                        Energy Commission, and the Federal Civil Defense Administration, which are

                    <p>69. This direct cost of mobilization represents only a small fraction of
                        investment and expenditure which has been flowing—and will continue to
                        flow—into the mobilization-affected segments of the economy. Private
                        investment is financing the bulk of the expansion of industry necessary to
                        meet defense needs and maintain a high level of civilian production.</p>
                    <p>70. The aggressive action of private industry to expand capacity has been
                        partly a response to the large and increasing volume of direct procurement
                        by the armed services and partly a desire to take advantage of the provision
                        in the Defense Production Act for accelerated amortization of plants and
                        other incentives. Of equal, if not greater importance, has been the
                        influence of optimistic expectations of the level of business activity over
                        the foreseeable future. All segments of the economy have been affected to a
                        degree. Gross private domestic investment rose to a new post-World War II
                        high of 59 billion in 1951 (see Table II). In 1952 it is expected to decline
                        and may fall further in calendar 1953 as the requirements of the total
                        mobilization program for new capacity and new equipment are gradually
                        fulfilled.</p>

                        through the use of an organized and trained civilian population, to minimize
                        the effects of enemy attacks and to insure the retention of our productive
                        capacity and will to fight. <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> is
                        approaching its objectives through two phases: (1) the planning and
                        developmental phase and (2) the operational phase, which arises during a
                        period of civil defense emergency.</p>
                    <p>2. The Federal Civil Defense Administration, as a result of continuing study
                        and analysis, as well as the recent availability of final 1950 census data,
                        has revised its list of target areas used for civil defense planning
                        purposes. The present list, announced on February 4, 1952, includes 191
                        target areas, of which 67, including 89 principal cities, have been
                        designated as critical target areas from the standpoint of atomic attack.
                        The civil defense plan contemplates organization not only for effective
                        defense of these areas but also for the possibility of attacks on other
                        areas throughout the Nation by atomic, biological, chemical and other
                        weapons. In brief, the plan provides for individual and community self-help,
                        for aid to be made immediately available from neighboring communities when
                        needed through the operation of mutual aid agreements, for mobile support
                        forces to move in on orders from unaffected areas, and for fixed support
                        facilities in the unaffected areas to furnish aid to casualties and
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>3. Progress toward a state of operational readiness is being made, although
                        it is admittedly uneven in the several States and localities, and among the
                        several programs within the total civil defense plan. Local organizations
                        are being staffed, volunteers being recruited and trained, supplies and
                        equipment being procured, mutual aid compacts being concluded, and mobile
                        and fixed support <pb xml:id="pg_48" n="48" facs="0078"/>forces and
                        facilities being organized. Perhaps the best index to hard, material
                        progress, however, is the Federal appropriation record, because of its
                        direct relationship to civil defensive strength. That record is summarized
                        in the accompanying table,<note n="10" xml:id="d10fn10">Not printed.</note>
                        and shown in relation to the estimated total non-recurring program cost. It
                        will be noted that the latter item has increased, largely as a result of the
                        addition of 13 new critical target areas, as indicated in par. two above.
                        For fiscal 1953, the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> submitted an
                        original budget request in the amount of $1, 041, 149, 950. Following the
                        President’s approval on October 18, 1951, of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Action No. 575–a,<note n="11" xml:id="d10fn11">See <ref
                                target="#d5fn1">footnote 1</ref>, p. 5.</note> and in compliance
                        with the directive inherent in that approval, the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1"
                            >FCDA</gloss> submitted a supplemental request which, together with the
                        original submission, would have made possible the procurement of all of the
                        non-recurring items in the total program except a few on which delivery
                        could not reasonably be anticipated during fiscal 1953. The Budget decision
                        to limit the combined requests to a total of $600, 000, 000, however,
                        necessitates that the completion of this part of the program be
                        substantially deferred, as set forth below.</p>
                    <p>4. The table reveals that by the end of fiscal 1952, less than 5% of the
                        required protective items can be in place. If the total amount requested in
                        the Executive Budget for fiscal 1953 is appropriated, an additional 30% of
                        the needed program items can be procured. Under the best of circumstances,
                        however, more than 65% of the total program must be deferred until fiscal
                        1954 or later. In more specific terms, by way of example, the several
                        programs will have achieved the following degrees of readiness by the end of
                        fiscal 1953, assuming that the requested appropriations are forthcoming:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Medical supplies will be adequate to carry 2, 000, 000 surviving
                            casualties through two weeks, although only half the necessary
                            improvised hospital equipment will be available. The total program makes
                            provision for two weeks’ care of 5, 000, 000 living casualties surviving
                            the first 24 hours after attack.</item>
                        <item>b. Slightly more than one-half the needed portable pipe, water
                            purifiers and chlorinators and mobile generators will be
                            stockpiled.</item>
                        <item>c. 60% of the necessary cots, blankets, and cooking equipment will be
                            available.</item>
                        <item>d. The national attack warning system will be in place, and each of
                            the 191 target areas will have bell-and-light and radio alert facilities
                            to transmit the alert to an average of ten points within each target
                            area. Two-thirds of the necessary sirens and other public warning
                            devices will be installed.</item>
                        <item>e. Necessary organizational equipment for communications will be in
                            place in the 67 critical target areas, in State Control Centers, <pb
                                xml:id="pg_49" n="49" facs="0079"/>and in some of the remaining
                            target and support areas. More than one-half of the total requirement,
                            however, will remain to be met.</item>
                        <item>f. 2350 fire pumpers will be in place, out of an estimated 6000
                            needed. Fire wardens will have 420, 000 portable extinguishers of an
                            estimated 800, 000 needed.</item>
                        <item>g. Rescue teams will have available 1725 equipped rescue vehicles, and
                            an additional 2025 sets of rescue tools. The estimated requirement is
                            9600 equipped vehicles.</item>
                        <item>h. Through the use of presently adequate facilities, the modification
                            of the maximum number of existing facilities, and a small amount of new
                            construction, protective shelter will be available to 18, 150, 000
                            people who need it. No adequate shelter will be available to an
                            additional 15, 350, 000 people who are normally to be found in areas of
                            likely bomb damage.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>5. Although Federal expenditures by the end of fiscal 1952 will equal less
                        than 5% of the total requirement, there are some hopeful signs in other
                        quarters. States and localities have appropriated nearly 20% of the total
                        amount to be required from them. Approximately 15% of the total estimated
                        requirement for volunteers has been met (exclusive of those who have merely
                        registered, or indicated a willingness to serve). There has been increasing
                        evidence of interest on the part of industrial leaders in adequate civil
                        defense measures in their plants, although it is too early to point to
                        substantial specific accomplishments. A major gain has been the rapidly
                        increasing public awareness of civil defense, the rate of increase in less
                        than a year being unprecedented in the experience of one opinion research
                        group. A major danger, however, has been the growing public faith in the
                        ability of military measures to provide complete security. Morale-building
                        magazine articles and public statements on radar, intercept squadrons, and
                        wonder weapons are giving growing numbers of people a false sense of
                        security and are hurting the civil defense effort. Balancing the gains and
                        losses, however, there is noticeable progress in civil defense. It is
                        reasonable to anticipate, assuming that the funds requested in the Executive
                        Budget for 1953 are appropriated, that the civil defense program will be
                        approximately one-third complete by June 1953, in terms of both material
                        items and trained volunteers. The rate of completion thereafter can only be
                        speculative, depending on the availability of funds.</p>

                    <p>1. Insofar as possible the intelligence programs of the intelligence agencies
                        and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are tied into the President’s
                        over-all program for Fiscal Year 1953, although in many cases indirectly. It
                        should be noted, however, that many of the functions and programs of
                        intelligence must be of a continuing nature quite apart from the specific
                        aspects of any given over-all annual program. Thus the departmental
                        intelligence agencies and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which compose
                        the Federal Intelligence Community, must make certain that the substantive
                        objectives controlling their collection, research, and estimating activities
                        are properly related to the problems posed by the Soviet world and to others
                        which confront the National Security Council. These activities must be so
                        developed and related that the resources of each provide maximum support for
                        the attainment of these objectives. Many intelligence programs have an
                        intimate bearing on one another or are a composite of departmental programs
                        and activities so that the strengthening of our habits and means of
                        collaboration is in a sense a major part of the intelligence program.</p>

                            true that the intelligence production resources of the Department are
                            insufficient to meet urgent and specialized needs and at the same time

                        efforts should be more sensitive in the detection of hostile threats as well
                        as current trends which necessarily have a bearing upon National Estimates
                        and policy matters.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Collection:</hi> The guidance for those resources
                        devoted to collection activities both overt and covert should be materially
                        improved by virtue of the foregoing programs although the nature of the
                        Soviet society will greatly limit our achievement. Programs are being
                        designed to exploit more effectively existing U.S. governmental and other
                        available sources of overt foreign intelligence information which have
                        hitherto gone unexploited. Although by far the greatest quantity of
                        intelligence information can be collected by overt means, much of the most
                        critical information needed can be obtained, if at all, only by clandestine
                        means. The objective here, because of the difficulty of the target, namely,
                        the Soviet orbit, must be to define clearly the most important targets.
                        United States efforts in clandestine operations are relatively new and the
                        number of personnel trained and qualified as is necessary for successful
                        operations is small. Clandestine intelligence, therefore, must be viewed in
                        the long perspective of 15 to 20 years and our objectives for the Fiscal
                        Year 1953 call for the elimination of marginal targets and greater
                        concentration on the significant targets, the building up of operational
                        bases and nets which inevitably require a great deal of time and are
                        frequently faced with setbacks arising from counterespionage activities of
                        the enemy or detection and exposure of our effort. It is recognized, of
                        course, that the military <pb xml:id="pg_53" n="53" facs="0083"/>services
                        have urgent tactical intelligence requirements which also require the use of
                        clandestine collection activities. By the end of this period considerable
                        strides will have been made toward isolating the most essential elements of
                        information which must be collected by covert means giving proper attention
                        to priorities. There has been some success in the collection of intelligence
                        on the Soviet and satellites by clandestine technological and scientific
                        means. The achievement of greater success in this field is to a great extent
                        dependent on the establishment of arrangements for cooperative concentration
                        of efforts.</p>
                    <p>7. With respect to the foregoing discussion of U.S. intelligence programs, it
                        should be noted that our intelligence system is confronted by certain
                        limitations which will inevitably result in a margin of uncertainty both in
                        our estimate and in our ability to give early warning of attack. These
                        limitations arise from the security consciousness and practices of the
                        Soviet State; the high state of war preparations of the Soviet; their
                        flexibility in making decisions and the speed with which, under their
                        system, such decisions can be implemented. It should be emphasized that the
                        best collective effort of which the United States intelligence community—or
                        any other—is capable cannot guarantee adequate advance warning of a surprise
                        attack.</p>

                    <p>8. Related activities which have been undertaken or are planned in support of
                        the President’s programs will require increasing financial and manpower
                        resources. Related to other programs the financial requirements are not
                        large. However, their size in relation to the intelligence aspect of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> budget is such that special methods
                        of presenting it to Congress may have to be developed. A major difficulty
                        with respect to manpower arises from the difficulty in recruiting and
                        training officers for this work. Personnel needs will require increased
                        reliance on Armed Service personnel.</p>

                        regarding the functions of the National Security Council in relationship to
                        the determination of the programs and budget for Fiscal Year 1954, is
                        circulated herewith for the information of the National Security

                        1952, which are due on August 1, have been requested of the respective
                        departments and agencies responsible for those programs. The reappraisal of
                        the objectives and policies set forth in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                    <p>Secret</p>
                    <p>It is my desire that final determination of the programs and budget for
                        fiscal year 1954 be made by December 1. In order that the analysis of the
                        Executive Office of the President, in coordination and consultation with the
                        agencies concerned, can be accomplished by that date, it will be necessary
                        for the Secretary of Defense to submit his program and estimates for fiscal
                        year 1954 to the Director of the Budget no later than November 1. This in
                        turn will require strict adherence to the date of September 2 which the
                        Secretary of Defense has established as the date for the budget submissions
                        to his office by the Military Services.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense has requested that the Military Services base their
                        budgetary programs and estimates on present approved strength. Every effort
                        should be made to meet commitments and missions within this total
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>To assist in arriving at carefully considered budget decisions I am asking
                        the National Security Council to complete by October 1 (1) a review of
                        presently approved national security programs designed to achieve United
                        States objectives based upon the report scheduled for completion August 1 on
                        the status of these programs, and (2) the desirability of projecting these
                        programs for fiscal year 1954 in relation to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>’s reappraisal of the objectives and policies of <gloss

                        114.</p>
                    <p>The Director for Mutual Security has already established the arrangements
                        through which, in consultation with the Director of the Budget and with the
                        other agencies concerned, he can assemble within the time called for by
                            <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> schedules, sufficient information regarding the scope and
                        timing of the U.S. defense and foreign aid effort to assist tentative
                        planning, subject to final determination of U.S. programs for submission to
                        the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Director for Mutual Security should submit his programs and estimates for
                        the fiscal year 1954 to the Director of the Budget no later than October
                        1.</p>
                    <p>Following the review of these budgets within the Executive Office of the
                        President, in coordination and consultation with the agencies concerned and
                        in light of the review by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, I intend
                        to meet just prior to December 1 with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        the National Security Council had been engaged since October 1951 in
                        overseeing an ongoing reappraisal of national security objectives and

                        Programs for National Security as of June 30, 1952.” The eight reports dealt
                        with (1) “The Military Program” (prepared by the Department of Defense), (2)

                    <p>At the same time, the drafting group of Staff Assistants to the Steering
                        Committee of the Senior Staff of the National Security Council submitted its
                        series of draft conclusions pertaining to a “Reappraisal of United States
                        Objectives and Strategy for National Security.” These draft conclusions
                        became <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 of August 15, 1952, which
                        was composed of two parts: a draft policy statement, printed on page 81, and
                        a separate paper subtitled “Summary and <pb xml:id="pg_57" n="57"
                            facs="0087"/>General Conclusions” which the Senior Staff first
                        tentatively accepted on August 12, then incorporated as part of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 at its meeting on August 14. The
                        “Summary and General Conclusions” is printed on page 73. On August 22, 1952,
                        a two-part Annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 was submitted
                        to the National Security Council by its Executive Secretary. The first part
                        of this Annex was entitled “The Bases of Soviet Action,” the second
                        “Relative Political, Economic and Military Capabilities.” The Annex is
                        printed on page 89.</p>
                    <p>The four papers which eventually comprised <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 Annex
                        had been the subject of lengthy discussion, repeated drafts, and frequent
                        refinements throughout the first eight months of the year. Although the
                        assignment to reappraise national security objectives and programs had been
                        formally assigned to the drafting group of Staff Assistants, documentation
                        in Department of State files suggests that the drafting work on all papers
                        save that dealing with “Relative Political, Economic and Military
                        Capabilities” (Part II of the Annex) was undertaken by the Department’s
                        Policy Planning Staff under the general supervision and direction of
                        Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BOHLENCE1">Charles E. Bohlen</persName> who
                        himself assumed responsibility for drafting what became Part I of the <gloss

                        Authorship of and/or responsibility for the drafting of the capabilities
                        paper cannot be precisely determined from Department of State files.</p>
                    <p>Documentation on the entire exercise culminating in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1 and its Annex is extensive. A number of papers

                        discussion at your level at this stage would be helpful. In fact, unless
                        there is clarity on the basic issues, detailed suggestions for drafting
                        changes may result in a waste of time.</p>
                    <p>The basic points on which I take issue with the draft papers are the
                        following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. I believe the papers tend to underestimate the risks which this
                            country faces.</item>
                        <item>2. I believe they tend to underestimate U.S. capabilities.</item>
                        <item>3. I believe they hold forth inadequate goals for U.S. policy.</item>
                        <item>4. I believe they outline an inadequate strategy.</item>
                        <item>5. I believe they give inadequate, unclear, or mistaken guidance to
                            those who must prepare specific national security programs.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The gist of the conclusions which flow from the positions taken in the draft
                        papers on these points might be summarized as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. The risks are much less than we have previously assumed.</item>
                        <item>2. Our actual and potential capabilities are much less than we have
                            previously assumed and we are going to be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis
                            the Soviet system for a long time.</item>
                        <item>3. There is nothing much we can do about this or should do about it.
                            Specifically, we should abandon: <list>
                                <item>a. Any hope of effective air and civil defenses;</item>
                                <item>b. any attempts at serious negotiation;</item>
                                <item>c. any attempt now or later to roll back the Iron
                                    Curtain;</item>
                                <item>d. any attempt to get preponderant power.</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_59" n="59" facs="0089"/>
                        <item>4. The conclusion is that we should accept a long period of relative
                            disadvantage during which we unhopefully wait for the U.S.S.R. to
                            change.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>This is, I think, about what the papers add up to, though one of the
                        difficulties is that they are internally inconsistent and that it is not
                        entirely clear what they are trying to say. They do not indicate in what
                        specific respects they are intended to revise <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68/2 or Part I of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        114/2. It is difficult to determine in what respects they provide guidance
                        for budget decisions (the purpose for which the President desires the
                        reappraisal to be made). It is unclear whether and in what respects the
                        conclusions rest on an analysis of new factual information and of the
                        experience with current programs or rest on a different interpretation of
                        the Soviet system than that contained in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68–114 Series.</p>
                    <p>These are the points which I hope we can discuss. In the attached memorandum,
                        each point is taken up separately and at some length with the object of
                        providing background material for the discussion.</p>
                    <p>By way of contrast to the draft papers, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68–114 Series leads, I think, to the following conclusions
                        in light of our experience. I have seen no evidence of a theoretical or
                        factual character which would invalidate them.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. The risk that the confrontation will lead to war remains great. The
                            risk that we will suffer piecemeal defeat in the cold war also remains
                            great.</item>
                        <item>2. The actual and potential capabilities of the U.S. and of allied and
                            friendly states are very large. The problem appears to be more the
                            effective organization, direction and leadership of these capabilities
                            and the distribution of emphasis in developing new capabilities than it
                            is one of an overall insufficiency of actual and potential capabilities.
                            We can within the next several years gain preponderant power.</item>
                        <item>3. As our total power—political, economic, and military—increases we
                            can reasonably hope that opportunities will arise for making progress by
                            peaceful means toward our objectives. It will require clearly
                            preponderant power to make satisfactory progress by these means—probably
                            more power than to win military victory in the event of war.</item>

                    <p rend="center">Basic Issues Raised by Draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> “Reappraisal of U.S. Objectives and Strategy for National
                        Security”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Risks</p>
                    <p>1. The draft papers concentrate much attention on the danger of the outbreak
                        of general war or local wars. The Bases of Soviet Action (Part I of the
                        Staff Study) appears to conclude that there is little danger of Soviet
                        military action, either general or local, whether by deliberate intent or
                        otherwise. It does not deal with the danger of Chinese Communist military
                        action. The General Conclusions (paras. 1–16 of the Statement of Policy) are
                        unclear. They seem to suggest (in paras. 4, 5, and 15) that there is some
                        danger of local military moves in the Far East and perhaps in other key
                        peripheral areas at the instigation of the U.S.S.R. and that “the
                        maintenance of the free world position will come increasingly to depend upon
                        its manifestation of a greater willingness and a greater capability than has
                        been demonstrated to commit appropriate forces for limited objectives”
                        (para. 15). Read in the light of “The Bases”, however, it is not clear
                        where, unless it is in the Far East, there is any danger of local military
                        moves.</p>
                    <p>2. “The Bases” indicates that it is unlikely that the Soviet Union “will take
                        or <hi rend="italic">support</hi>” overt military action in the cold war
                        unless certain criteria are met. An examination of these criteria leads us
                        to the conclusion that there is probably no area on the Soviet periphery
                        which meets all these criteria. If the criteria are the same for Communist
                        China as for the Soviet Union, there is probably no area in the Far East in
                        which Chinese Communist action is a serious possibility.</p>
                    <p>3. Such local action, moreover, is more likely, according to “The Bases”,
                        than general war arising from miscalculation or from the deterioration of a
                        deadlocked situation. There appears to be, therefore, little danger of an
                        undeliberated general war. In light of this, it is difficult to interpret
                        para. 3 of the General Conclusions.</p>
                    <p>4. The deliberate initiation of general war is unlikely. This follows from
                        the definition of a “decisive blow”, from the assurance that the Soviet
                        Union does not now have the capability of striking a “decisive blow” and can
                        be precluded from obtaining this capability, <pb xml:id="pg_61" n="61"
                            facs="0091"/>and from the “highly dangerous” threat to the regime which
                        any major war would pose.</p>
                    <p>5. We believe that it is very difficult to draw from the analysis of risks in
                        the Staff Study and the General Conclusions any guidance for the development
                        of military strength. We also believe that the analysis of risks suggests
                        that our strategy should be patterned on the
                            Taft–<persName>Dulles</persName> retaliatory thesis—a thesis which is,
                        in our view, extremely dangerous. This thesis is expressed in the General
                        Conclusions, para. 24a.</p>
                    <p>6. We believe that the present state of international tensions, the
                        situations in particular areas, notably Korea, Indo-China, Formosa, Berlin,
                        and Iran, and the fact that the West does not yet have the capability of
                        successfully defending areas of vital interest to it but is trying with some
                        success to develop such capabilities require us to assume that the risk of
                        war remains great. We believe it would be imprudent to make a contrary
                        assumption so long as we do not have the capability of successfully
                        defending areas of vital interest—including the defense of the United States
                        against “direct attack of serious and possibly catastrophic proportions.” We
                        believe that the conclusion that the risks are great would provide guidance
                        as to the minimum acceptable goal of our efforts to develop military
                        capabilities and provide a basis for the development of a sound
                        strategy.</p>
                    <p>7. We believe that much of the difficulty in the analysis of the Soviet
                        system stems from a false dichotomy between power and ideology or doctrine.
                        Power, as Bertrand Russell has pointed out, is the capacity to achieve
                        intended results. To say that <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> has never placed world revolution above the security
                        of his base in Russia is not to say that he does not have an aim over and
                        beyond the security of his base. To say this it would be necessary to show
                        that he is concerned only with the security of the regime, that this is his
                        sole aim, and that the security of the regime is desired for itself and not
                        as a means to anything more. We think it would be dangerous to make this
                        assumption, which would be to assume that Soviet foreign policy encourages
                        tensions abroad only as a contribution to the maintenance of the regime.
                        This is surely part of the explanation of Soviet foreign policy, but is it
                        the whole explanation? (See Morgan’s memorandum, July 2, 1952, on <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>, Ideology and Power.)<note n="4"

                            “Morgan” is presumably Marthlyn Morgan of the Policy Reports
                            Staff.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>8. We believe that another difficulty lies in the concentration on the
                        question whether the Soviet rulers will deliberately initiate general war.
                        We are inclined to agree that the Soviet rulers will <pb xml:id="pg_62"
                            n="62" facs="0092"/>not deliberately initiate general war in the sense
                        that the first sign of trouble will be an attack on the U.S. or on U.S.
                        forces by Soviet forces. We believe, however, that there is a serious danger
                        that circumstances may arise in which the Soviet rulers will believe that
                        the maintenance of their power position requires them to take or instigate
                        actions involving near certainty of war. We think that in such circumstances
                        they would attempt to conceal their responsibility and to pin responsibility
                        on the West, but we would regard such actions as representing at least
                        deliberate acceptance of serious risk of war.</p>
                    <p>9. A special point in connection with risks is that regarding the “atomic
                        stand-off”. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 held that the existence
                        of two large atomic stockpiles might prove to be an incitement to war. The
                        present draft paper foresees a mutual recognition that general war is no
                        longer a tolerable contingency. In our own case it may well be that the
                        public will bring pressure to bear on the Government to refrain from use of
                        atomic weapons as the public becomes aware of the increasing Soviet ability
                        to inflict damage on this country. The Soviet rulers, as they obtain a
                        capability of inflicting “possibly catastrophic” damage, will not be under
                        similar pressure. If there is an important advantage in surprise and if
                        other circumstances tend to produce a showdown, Soviet possession of large
                        atomic capabilities may, it seems to us, tend to incite rather than deter a
                        surprise atomic attack by the Soviet Union. In short, we think that the
                        existence of two large atomic stockpiles is not so likely to deter general
                        war as to affect the timing and occasion of general war—probably to our
                        disadvantage.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Capabilities</p>
                    <p>1. We find the analysis of absolute and relative capabilities confusing.
                        Almost every conceivable viewpoint is somewhere expressed. These are
                        statements to the effect that we should continue our efforts to organize and
                        develop the free world’s superior resources (General Conclusions, para. 18).
                        There are other statements to the effect that the Soviet Union is and may
                        continue to be able to allocate equal or greater resources to military
                        purposes because it is not forced to support an elaborate consumer economy
                        (General Conclusions, para. 9). Throughout the papers there are various
                        references to the limitations imposed on our efforts to build strength by
                        the necessity of maintaining a free society and by the willingness of free
                        men to pay taxes, etc. On the whole we find a strong defeatist note
                        throughout the report as regards the ability of the free world to develop
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>2. This is reinforced by the statements to the effect that even if the free
                        world could develop superior strength, this would not <pb xml:id="pg_63"
                            n="63" facs="0093"/>enable it to make progress toward its objectives
                        (General Conclusions, para. 22). If superior strength is not of any use and
                        if the effort to get it threatens the free-ness of free societies, it seems
                        to follow that we should not and need not make the effort, especially since,
                        as shown in the analysis of risks, there is little danger of general or
                        local war, unless the Soviet rulers are convinced as a matter of fact that
                        the U.S. is about to attack the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>3. The view of capabilities seems, therefore, to be directly related to the
                        views regarding objectives and strategy, and we shall return to it in the
                        following two sections. At this point we will record only certain
                        differences or doubts with respect to capabilities:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. We do not believe that “it is demonstrable that the free world is
                            not moving toward” a position of marked relative superiority to the
                            Soviet system. We believe, on the contrary, that our relative position
                            has already significantly improved, that it will probably continue to
                            improve, and that it is possible for the free world to gain clearly
                            preponderant power within a decade.</item>
                        <item>b. We do not believe that it is now possible to reach definitive
                            conclusions about the possibilities for civil and air defense. We have
                            seen studies which indicate that highly effective defenses can be
                            developed at costs well within our capabilities. We have heard from
                            other sources that new weapons developments may make effective defense
                            impossible or prohibitively expensive in time. Even if this is so it
                            does not necessarily indicate that investments at this time in civil and
                            air defense against present means of attack would be unwise, for there
                            is, in our view, a serious risk of war before new means of attack are
                            developed which would render these defenses obsolete.</item>
                        <item>c. We do not believe that the ability of free societies to do what is
                            necessary to gain their objectives is subject to such severe limitations
                            as the papers indicate. On the contrary, we believe that the margins of
                            tolerance in the United States are much higher than the papers suggest.
                            We also believe that the political and economic capabilities of other
                            free countries can be increased. It is obvious that the development of
                            strength should not be pushed beyond the limits of political and
                            economic capabilities. It may be desirable to redistribute the emphasis
                            in our programs, so that we pay more attention to the development of
                            political and economic capabilities. The draft papers, however, provide
                            no guidance on this. We believe this is one of their major
                            weaknesses.</item>
                        <item>d. There is, in our view, a hierachy of goals with respect to
                            strength. This hierarchy is: <list>
                                <item>(1) political and economic strength.</item>
                                <item>(2) the mobilization base, including military
                                    production.</item>
                                <item>(3) military strength in being.</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Political and economic strength is basic. The development of military
                        strength-in-being should not (and indeed can not) be pushed beyond the limit
                        of political and economic capabilities. It should also not be pushed at the
                        expense of the development of an adequate <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64"
                            facs="0094"/>mobilization base. A major problem for the United States
                        and other free nations is to preserve a sound relationship among these three
                        elements of strength. This is a key question in the development of our
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 programs on which guidance is
                        needed but is not provided by the draft papers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Goals</p>
                    <p>1. The draft papers formally endorse the objectives stated in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68/2. It proceeds, however, to state that these objectives
                        can not be attained. It states (para. 22):</p>
                    <p>“. . . it does not appear that the developing situation will, in the
                        foreseeable future, require the Soviets to yield interests now held which
                        they regard as important to their security. <hi rend="italic">Nor does it
                            appear likely that an increase to any higher level of strength which the
                            free world could maintain over an extended period would significantly
                            change the prospect. Neither does it appear that there is any prospect,
                            regardless of the level of strength we may achieve, of negotiating
                            lasting settlements with the present communist regime. Our strength may
                            deter deliberate initiation of hostilities by the Soviets or the
                            undertaking of local aggression, but it will not change the implacable
                            nature of communism which dictates that it be hostile to all not under
                            its control.</hi>”</p>
                    <p>This indicates that we cannot roll back Soviet power nor hope that the
                        successful containment of Soviet power will produce any significant changes
                        in the nature of the Soviet system. The endorsement of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68/2 objectives is therefore a merely formal endorsement.
                        Our maximum actual objective becomes merely to deter general war and the
                        undertaking of local aggression for an indefinite period of time—probably
                        permanently.</p>
                    <p>2. We believe that this goal is inadequate and also unrealistic. We do not
                        believe that the situation can remain indefinitely static. One side will
                        gain and the other will decline as a factor in world affairs. It must be our
                        objective to be the one which gains.</p>
                    <p>3. Using the term “power” in the widest sense to denote all those material
                        and intangible factors, both actual and potential, which make up the
                        capacity to exert influence in world affairs, the United States and the
                        Soviet Union are engaged in a struggle for preponderant power. Given the
                        polarization of power around the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., to seek less than
                        preponderant power would be to opt for defeat. Preponderant power must be
                        the objective of U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>4. As regards military strength, we also believe that the West must seek
                        preponderance in a certain sense. It is agreed by almost everyone that war
                        might come at any time and that we should be prepared for war. Wars end in
                        victory, defeat, or a stalemate on some line. The West must have sufficient
                        military strength at the beginning of a war to enable it to hold and to
                        develop preponderant <pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0095"/>military
                        strength in the course of the war. Otherwise it will suffer defeat or a
                        stalemate which would move the Iron Curtain westward. We must rely primarily
                        on the Defense establishment to determine what proportion of our potential
                        military strength it is necessary to have in the forms of strength-in-being
                        and readily mobilizable. It must be our objective to assure that a
                        sufficient proportion of our potential military strength, whatever this may
                        be, is available in these forms. In this sense preponderant military
                        strength is a necessary objective.</p>
                    <p>5. We do not see what evidence there is for believing that the side having
                        preponderant power (in the widest sense, which includes preponderant
                        military strength) will not eventually achieve its objectives. We believe
                        that there is a hierarchy of objectives, namely:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. strength at the center</item>
                        <item>b. strength at the periphery</item>
                        <item>c. the retraction of Soviet power and a change in the Soviet
                            system.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Clearly, we should not undertake actions to accomplish (c) at serious risk to
                        the attainment of (a) and (b). This presents strategic problems which are
                        discussed in the following section. But the fact that there is a hierarchy
                        of objectives does not lead to the conclusion that it is undesirable to set
                        the third objective or impossible to achieve it. As to the latter point, we
                        believe that as the free world’s capabilities are developed, opportunities
                        will arise for inducing or compelling a retraction of Soviet power, not, of
                        course, without any risk but at acceptable risk.</p>
                    <p>6. At any rate we believe that it would impart a defeatist coloration to all
                        our efforts and eventually weaken our efforts if the Government adopted the
                        view that for the indefinite future the best we can hope for is to hold on
                        to a disadvantageous position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Strategy and Guidance in Program Development</p>
                    <p>1. It is stated (para. 19) that “Parts I and II of the staff study do not
                        lead to a fundamental alteration of the basic strategy as set forth in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 20 Series, but they do underline—by revealing the fuller
                        emergence of developments which in 1950 were discernible only in outline—the
                        increased risks we run in pursuing this strategy and the need to adjust in
                        important particulars our expectations for its success.” In short, the
                        strategy is not going to produce progress toward the objectives defined in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 68/2. The new strategy is outlined in para. 23 and
                        developed more fully in subsequent paragraphs. These paragraphs are, for the
                        most part, couched in generalities which would be, with a few exceptions,
                            <pb xml:id="pg_66" n="66" facs="0096"/>acceptable as generalities were
                        it not for the context in which they appear. The major exceptions are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Para. 24a seems to formulate the Taft–<persName>Dulles</persName>
                            strategy.</item>
                        <item>b. Para. 27 does not provide for an adequate civil defense program and
                            indeed states the American people should “avoid devoting their substance
                            to an unrealistic concentration upon purely defensive measures.”
                            However, in light of the probability that both the Soviet Union and the
                            United States will develop atomic stockpiles of sufficient size to
                            permit attacks of serious and possibly catastrophic proportions, it may
                            well be that the side with the best air and civil defense systems will
                            be the side with the largest net capability and that greater increases
                            in net capability can be obtained at some point by additional
                            investments in air and civil defenses than by additional investments in
                            offensive power.</item>
                        <item>c. Para. 33 goes too far, in our view, when it describes the prospects
                            for genuine negotiation in the next several years as being
                            negligible.</item>
                        <item>d. Para. 34 states that our present mobilization policy is designed to
                            maximize the chance that general war will be postponed. We do not
                            understand the reasoning on which this statement is based.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. In addition to the foregoing criticisms of the generalized description of
                        our strategy, we believe that this section of the draft paper fails to give
                        adequate guidance to those who must develop specific national security
                        programs. There are a host of questions which must be faced in developing
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 programs. One of the major
                        purposes of the present paper is to define our strategy in terms which will
                        provide guidance to those who must answer these questions.</p>
                    <p>3. As to the broader problems of strategy, we also feel that the draft paper
                        is deficient. We would make the following comments on this question:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. There are only three conceivable ways in which our objectives with
                            respect to the Soviet system might be achieved. One is to defeat the
                            Soviet Union in general war and to impose our will. Everyone agrees that
                            we should not adopt this strategy. A second is to roll back the Iron
                            Curtain in local actions and to wait for this change in the world
                            environment to result, first, in a change of Soviet behavior and
                            ultimately in a change, either by revolutionary or evolutionary means,
                            in the nature of the Soviet regime. We might help this process along by
                            political means. The current revision writes this off as a practical
                            strategy, but it is not convincing on this point. The third is identical
                            with the second except that we would not undertake to use force or even
                            the threat of force except to maintain the present line of division.
                            This is now usually referred to as “containment”. The present revision
                            suggests that successful containment would not lead to a change in the
                            Soviet regime. It seems excessively pessimistic on this point. Public
                            controversy now centers around the question whether we should pursue the
                            policy of “roll-back” or the policy of “containment”. <pb xml:id="pg_67"
                                n="67" facs="0097"/>Probably successful containment would in fact
                            merge into a policy of roll-back by creating opportunities of one kind
                            and another for moving back the Iron Curtain. It should be noted that
                            the objectives are the same and that the controversy concerns,
                            therefore, means, not ends.</item>
                        <item>b. It seems clear that our first job is to develop sufficient over-all
                            strength to contain effectively the Soviet system. We are now far from
                            being sure that we have completed this task. It may be, however, that we
                            have already reached this position as regards Soviet aggression and that
                            the Soviet rulers dare not risk further expansion. It may even be that
                            we could now undertake without excessive risk to roll back the Iron
                            Curtain in one or more areas: Korea, Indochina, China, and Albania. This
                            seems doubtful, however. At any rate we do not feel confident that we
                            have sufficient strength to make the risks of such actions acceptably
                            low, even if circumstances arose in which responsibility for initiating
                            the actions had to be borne by the Communists.</item>
                        <item>c. On the contrary, one of the dangers in the current situation is
                            that the Soviet rulers might decide—believing war and atomic bombardment
                            to be an unavoidable phase of the struggle for power—to “eat” whatever
                            damage we can inflict, to push us back to the Western Hemisphere, and to
                            establish, so to speak, a new line of “reciprocal containment”. In this
                            way they would gain a potential vastly superior to our own in all
                            material factors and set the stage for the final phases of the struggle
                            for preponderant power. We believe there are conceivable circumstances
                            under which, from the Kremlin’s point of view, this might appear to be a
                            rational course of action.</item>
                        <item>d. The great diplomatic tasks are to preserve the opportunity for the
                            West to develop preponderant power in the area and with the resources
                            now available to it and to assure as rapid a development of military
                            strength as Western political-economic capabilities permit. It seems
                            clear that to the extent that the West indicates dissatisfaction with
                            the present line of East-West division and a determination to roll it
                            back by direct action, we tend to strengthen the conviction of the
                            Soviet rulers that war is inevitable and thus that since probably
                            neither side now has the power to prevail, the question is on what line
                            reciprocal containment is to be established. While we should not
                            overestimate the possibility of influencing the Soviet rulers by
                            diplomatic action, neither should we underestimate the importance of
                            gaining the time necessary to make Western Europe and Japan and certain
                            other key areas defensible. Nor should we underestimate the fear of
                            general war which is probably felt by the Soviet rulers. It is
                            conceivable that both sides might at some early time think it in their
                            advantage to stabilize (formally or informally) the situation for the
                            time being, though both sides would continue to strive in other ways for
                            preponderant power. This might make it difficult for free peoples to
                            continue to build up their strength. Nevertheless it does seem that it
                            would be advantageous to us to have a period of stability. At any rate
                            it seems dangerous to adopt the political posture that we must roll back
                            the Iron Curtain before we are in a position to hold on about the
                            present line. We should be willing, if necessary, to pay some <pb
                                xml:id="pg_68" n="68" facs="0098"/>price in order to limit the
                            struggle for predominant power in circumstances in which, in the event
                            of war, the Soviet Union could draw, after the initial phase, on the
                            resources of Eurasia while we were confined to the Western Hemisphere
                            and a few outlying islands. We believe that the draft paper should deal
                            with this problem which is now receiving much attention in both private
                            and official circles. There is a real danger that we will be pushed into
                            an overt commitment to use our strength at some time to liberate the
                            satellites.</item>

                            >NSC</gloss> 20, 68 and 114 Series. The fundamental purpose of the
                        United States remains as stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68:
                        to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society founded upon the
                        dignity and worth of the individual. Pursuit of this fundamental purpose
                        should continue to be through that general policy which seeks:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To develop throughout the free world positive appeals superior to
                            those of communism;</item>
                        <item>b. Even at grave risk of general war, to block further expansion of
                            Soviet power;</item>
                        <item>c. By all means short of general war to induce a retraction of the
                            Kremlin’s control and influence, and so to foster the seeds of
                            destruction within the Soviet system that the Kremlin is brought at
                            least to the point of modifying its behavior to conform to generally
                            accepted international standards.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_69" n="69" facs="0099"/>
                    <p>2. We continue to believe that the free world with its superior resources
                        should be able to build and maintain for whatever length of time proves to
                        be necessary such strength that the Soviet orbit will be unable to make
                        substantial advances either physically or politically, and that if the free
                        world acquires such strength, the internal contradictions of the Soviet
                        totalitarian system will, with some positive assistance from us, cause that
                        system gradually to weaken and decay. Therefore, provided the United States
                        and its allies succeed in developing and maintaining an adequate level of
                        over-all strength to prevent or win general war and to block further
                        expansion of Soviet power, no specific time can be established by which the
                        objectives set forth in paragraph 1c above must be achieved.</p>
                    <p>3. Although no fundamental departures from the conclusions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20 and 68 Series are required, it is
                        essential that we take into account certain factors that have acquired new
                        significance since the adoption of these reports:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The United States and its major allies have responded to the
                            perilous situation of 1950; they have responded collectively to the
                            attack upon South Korea; they are improving the security position of
                            Western Europe; they, and particularly the United States, have
                            significantly improved their readiness for war. These efforts, though
                            not yet complete, have already reenforced the deterrents to general war
                            and reaffirmed the reasoning of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68
                            by which both preventive war and isolation were rejected as courses of
                            action.</item>
                        <item>b. There has also been a substantial further development of Soviet
                            orbit strength since 1950. Modernization and expansion programs in the
                            Soviet, satellite, and Chinese Communist armed forces are proceeding,
                            supported by a rapidly growing economic and industrial capacity and by a
                            high level of scientific and technical capability in selected fields of
                            vital military importance. As a result of the developing atomic and
                            possible thermonuclear capability of the USSR, the vulnerability of the
                            United States to direct attack which is now serious, will in a few years
                            assume critical proportions.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. It must remain the objective of the free world to maintain such over-all
                        strength as will (a) confront the Kremlin with the prospect that a Soviet
                        attack would result in serious risk to the Soviet regime, (b) reduce the
                        opportunities for local Soviet aggression and political warfare, and (c)
                        permit the exploitation of rifts between the USSR and other communist states
                        and between the satellite regimes and the peoples they are oppressing, thus
                        possibly offering to certain satellite peoples the prospect of liberation
                        without war. The United States should accordingly pursue with determination
                        and constancy the courses of action set forth in the following
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_70" n="70" facs="0100"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Deterrent to General War</p>
                    <p>5. The United States should develop and maintain, in cooperation with its
                        allies, a position of strength, flexibility and depth adequate to deter the
                        Soviets from deliberately initiating general war and to discourage them from
                        pursuing courses of action involving grave risk of general war.</p>
                    <p>6. To achieve such a deterrent, the United States should take the necessary
                        measures to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Develop the political unity of and encourage growth of strength and
                            determination in the free world so as to deny the opportunity for the
                            Soviets to undertake local aggression which might develop into general
                            war.</item>
                        <item>b. Develop and retain, under all foreseeable conditions, the
                            capability to deliver an offensive of sufficient power to inflict
                            massive damage on the Soviet war-making capacity.</item>
                        <item>c. Assure ready defensive strength adequate to provide a reasonable
                            initial defense and to ensure reasonable protection to the nation during

                        <item>d. Maintain the mobilization base (both military and industrial<note

                    <p>7. The United States should develop a substantially improved air and civil
                        defense in the light of the capacity of the USSR to deliver an atomic and
                        possible thermonuclear attack against the United States, in order to protect
                        the American people and maintain their morale and thereby assure freedom of
                        action to the U.S. Government, and to increase the capability of the
                        country’s economic capacity to recover from such an attack. At the same time
                        the American people must be brought to a recognition of the need to accept
                        and live with a substantial degree of vulnerability without an undue
                        concentration upon personal safety which would prevent the projection of our

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Outside the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>8. A preliminary study of problems in the areas outside the Soviet orbit
                        brings out two major causes of concern which indicate the need for a restudy
                        and possible change of emphasis and redirection <pb xml:id="pg_71" n="71"
                            facs="0101"/>of certain of our efforts with respect to those areas.
                        These causes of concern are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The efforts which our major European allies, particularly the
                            United Kingdom and France, are called upon to make (a) to fulfill their
                            planned obligations to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and (b) to
                            support their existing positions outside of Europe are, in the light of
                            current U.S. assistance programs, beyond their present political and
                            economic capacity to maintain;</item>
                        <item>b. The readily disposable outside strength of the United States and
                            its allies, together with present indigenous political and military
                            strength in areas on the periphery of the Soviet orbit, is insufficient
                            to escape from the dilemma of having to choose, in the face of local
                            aggression, between the eventual further expansion of Soviet power and
                            general war.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>9. In light of the above, the United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Reexamine the amounts and allocations of resources to various areas
                            in terms of kind, quantity and priority, to determine (1) whether a
                            general increase in the level of programs is required to deal with the
                            several threats; (2) whether the present balance between military
                            assistance and the various types of economic assistance is appropriate;
                            and (3) whether the allocations as between areas are in proper
                            relationship to the importance to the general program of our European
                            allies and to the threats facing the United States in the Far East and
                            the Middle East.</item>
                        <item>b. Make the necessary preparation to be increasingly able to commit
                            military forces, as appropriate and in cooperation with its allies, in
                            support of its objectives in specific geographic areas. At the same time
                            the United States should encourage and as appropriate assist in the
                            development of indigenous forces and regional defense arrangements
                            capable of bearing an increasing share of responsibility for resisting
                            local communist aggression. When forces are committed to combat a local
                            aggression, the action should whenever possible be of sufficient
                            strength and scope to effect a decision favorable to the United
                            States.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Within the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>10. Where operations can be conducted on terms which may result in a relative
                        decrease in Soviet power without involving unacceptable risks, the United
                        States should pursue and as practicable intensify positive political,
                        economic, propaganda, and paramilitary operations against the Soviet orbit,
                        particularly those operations designed to weaken Kremlin control over the
                        satellites. However, we should not over-estimate the effectiveness of the
                        activities we can pursue within the Soviet orbit, and should proceed with
                        caution and a careful weighing of the risks in pressing upon what the
                        Kremlin probably regards as its vital interests.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Warfare</p>
                    <p>11. Both within and without the Soviet orbit the United States should conduct
                        political warfare operations as an integral part of its over-all strategy.
                        However, we should recognize that, barring extraordinary opportunities for
                        exploitation such as the death of <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> might provide, such operations cannot be depended
                        upon to reduce drastically the basic threat which the Soviet system poses
                        for the free world.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Support</p>
                    <p>12. The United States should undertake systematically and consistently a
                        program of clarifying to the American public and to other peoples of the
                        free world the complex problems of the free world in meeting the Soviet
                        threat, the nature of that threat, the strength and resources the free world
                        possesses to meet that threat, and, to the extent possible, the reasoning
                        behind the general lines of policy and action described herein, in order to
                        secure that public understanding and support which is essential to the
                        success of our policies and actions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiations</p>
                    <p>13. The United States, in cooperation with its allies, should develop a sound
                        negotiating position vis-à-vis the USSR and should be prepared to enter into
                        any negotiations with the Soviet Union which offer promise of achieving <hi
                            rend="italic">modi-vivendi,</hi> or which, for other reasons, appear to
                        be desirable. On the other hand, we should recognize that only enforceable
                        agreements are meaningful and that the major contributions of negotiation in
                        the foreseeable future may be to convince the world of the validity and
                        sincerity of our position and to serve as a political warfare weapon.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mobilization Policy</p>
                    <p>14. The United States should continue to pursue a policy of limited
                        mobilization designed to develop and maintain a favorable power position
                        without resort to an armament effort that would disrupt the economies of the
                        free nations and thus undermine the vitality and integrity of free society.
                        Such a power position should be sufficient to (1) maximize the chance that
                        general war will be indefinitely postponed, (2) provide an effective counter
                        to local aggression in key peripheral areas, and (3) provide the basis for
                        winning a general war should it occur.</p>
                    <p>15. It continues to be impracticable to fix a tentative D-day by which our
                        preparations for war should be at their peak, although there are estimated
                        time periods within which measures must be taken to reduce or eliminate
                        vulnerabilities of a critical nature.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_73" n="73" facs="0103"/>
                    <p>16. The adequacy of currently projected mobilization goals is a question
                        separate from that of the soundness of the concept of limited mobilization.
                        Appraisal of the present goals must be accomplished on a continuing basis as
                        the various programs are fulfilled and in light of changes in the world
                        situation. The rapid growth of the Soviet atomic capability, the prospect
                        for our continued heavy commitment in Korea, the serious threat to Southeast
                        Asia, the danger of further deterioration of the situations in Iran and
                        Egypt, the grave implications of further Soviet efforts to force the Western
                        powers out of Berlin—all of these portents underline the risks we run in
                        adhering to the policy of “stretch-out” and to presently programmed force
                        levels.</p>
                    <p>17. Recognizing the risks involved in adhering to the policy of “stetch-out”
                        and to presently programmed force levels, in the light of the situation
                        facing us, the United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Accelerate the production of selected military end-items under
                            present programs.</item>
                        <item>b. Place continued high emphasis upon scientific and technical
                            programs in fields of military applications and give careful
                            consideration to the desirability of substantial new programs and
                            changes of emphasis in research and development.</item>
                        <item>c. In proper balance with the programs developed in connection with
                            the reexamination called for in paragraph 9 above, consider raising the
                            goals of military production now contemplated. An acceleration and
                            upward adjustment of our national defense programs as a whole are well
                            within our capacity and can be accomplished without serious adverse
                            effects on the U.S. economy.</item>

                    <p>1. If the Soviet rulers should attain, in their judgment, the capability of
                        defeating the United States or of so reducing its power potential <pb
                            xml:id="pg_74" n="74" facs="0104"/>as to render it permanently incapable
                        of effectively challenging Soviet power and if they should come to believe
                        that such action would not involve serious risk to the maintenance of their
                        regime, they would probably deliberately initiate general war.</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviets might attack the West if they were convinced as a matter of
                        fact, rather than theory, that an attack by the West was actually
                        imminent.</p>
                    <p>3. Nor can it be excluded that if in the eyes of the Soviet leaders
                        developments in the power balance appeared directly and imminently to
                        threaten the security of the Soviet Union or areas under its control, they
                        might feel compelled to force certain outstanding issues in such a way that
                        the result might well be the outbreak of war without any deliberate
                        intention on the part of the Soviet Union to bring about such an event.</p>
                    <p>4. War could come from communist action based on initial Soviet
                        miscalculation of the free world’s interest in and reaction to the situation
                        in some particular area.</p>
                    <p>5. War could come from a deadlocked situation in which basic interests of
                        both parties are involved with an act of one side setting off an unwinding
                        chain of action and reaction which neither side would be able fully to
                        control.</p>
                    <p>6. In the absence of general war, the Soviet leadership will probably
                        continue a pushing and probing exploitation of all weaknesses in the free
                        world. This means that the Soviets can be expected to continue their efforts
                        to consolidate and expand their influence in Asia; undermine U.S. leadership
                        of the free world; break the unity of the West; prevent the integration of
                        West Germany and Japan into the Western system; disrupt the economies and
                        governmental effectiveness of our major continental European allies; and
                        exploit the intemperate nationalism and political instability of the Middle
                        East. Thus, there continues to be danger of such a progressive and
                        cumulative loss of positions of importance to the U.S. (either as a result
                        of deterioration within the free nations or of communist cold war actions or
                        a process involving both) that the United States would eventually be reduced
                        to an isolated and critically vulnerable position.</p>
                    <p>7. The strongest deterrent to general war will be the achievement and
                        maintenance of such an over-all position of strength by <pb xml:id="pg_75"
                            n="75" facs="0105"/>the free world as will force the Soviets to
                        recognize the undesirability of challenging it.</p>
                    <p>8. The Soviet orbit now has formidable military capabilities. It has
                        succeeded in maintaining large and increasingly well-equipped Soviet armed
                        forces, in expanding and improving the satellite armed and para-military
                        forces, and in developing significant atomic, electronic and possibly <gloss
                            target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>
                        capabilities. The Soviet long-range air force is capable of atomic attack on
                        the United States and might achieve surprise in the initial strike. The
                        Soviets would be able to support extensive military operations of an
                        offensive nature during the early phases of a general war.</p>
                    <p>9. The Soviet orbit is expanding its current production; it is also expanding
                        its industrial, economic, and scientific potential. There are indications
                        that these latter developments are long range in nature. The USSR has
                        demonstrated a high level of scientific and technical capability in several
                        vital military fields, notably nuclear energy, aircraft design and
                        production, electronics and chemical warfare.</p>
                    <p>10. The United States and its major allies have responded to the perilous
                        situation of 1950; they have responded collectively to the attack upon South
                        Korea; they are improving the security position in Western Europe and in the
                        Pacific; they, and particularly the United States have significantly
                        improved their readiness for war.</p>
                    <p>11. The United States is increasing its atomic strength and may soon develop
                        a thermonuclear weapon. There is, in fact, every indication that its present
                        quantitative advantage in atomic weapons stockpile, in means of delivery and
                        in the production of fissionable materials will be further increased. The
                        U.S. is also developing an increasing variety of mass destruction weapons
                        and methods for their delivery; well dispersed overseas bases are being
                        established within range of the sources of Soviet political and industrial
                        power.</p>
                    <p>12. The United States and other countries in the free world are engaged in a
                        mobilization program which is designed both to facilitate any future shift
                        to a war economy and to maintain an increased level of strength over an
                        extended period. Moreover, the United States has the economic capacity to
                        sustain a generally higher level of armament production than is contemplated
                        by currently projected programs and is capable of accelerating the
                        production of selected items within the framework of present programs. Such
                        an increase in the level of armament production would, however, require a
                        willingness in the United States and allied countries to accept an increased
                        diversion of scarce materials and other resources to such production through
                        more severe direct physical controls. In addition more vigorous price and
                        credit controls <pb xml:id="pg_76" n="76" facs="0106"/>and a heavier tax
                        burden would be required in order to protect the economies of these
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>13. In the light of the above, the United States and its allies hold it
                        within their power to maintain a position of such strength, flexibility and
                        depth as to make it very difficult for the Soviet leaders to believe that
                        general war could be undertaken without grave risks to their regime.</p>
                    <p>14. The free world enjoys a very substantial superiority in basic productive
                        potential over the Soviet orbit, but this superiority is not the sole
                        measure of the relative ability to undertake large armament programs over an
                        extended period in the absence of general war. The Soviet orbit, through its
                        total control over the Soviet economy and population, can utilize a high
                        proportion of the Soviet orbit resources and potential to achieve and
                        maintain the present level of military preparedness. For the free world an
                        adequate utilization of its resources and potential to counter the Soviet
                        threat is far more difficult to achieve in the absence of general war.</p>
                    <p>15. Moreover, the increasingly destructive power that will be available to
                        both sides makes it doubtful that time would be available to ensure the
                        conversion of the economies to full war production. In planning the
                        utilization of its resources in the absence of general war, therefore, the
                        free world cannot give the same weight as heretofore to its heavy
                        preponderance of productive capacity and economic potential as a determining
                        factor in preventing or winning a general war.</p>
                    <p>16. Because of improved methods of delivery, in combination with increased
                        atomic and possibly thermonuclear weapon stockpiles, the Soviet orbit will
                        acquire during the next several years an increasing capability to damage
                        critically the United States and its allies. Defensive counter-measures now
                        in prospect probably cannot prevent the Soviet orbit from achieving such
                        increasing capability, although such measures can certainly affect the rate
                        of increase. The same reasoning would apply in general to the defensive
                        position of the Soviet orbit. While continuing to take reasonable active and
                        passive defensive measures, and to seek and explore new technological
                        possibilities for feasible defense, the free world must probably accept a
                        substantial degree of vulnerability and avoid undue concentration of
                        resources on defense at the expense of measures necessary to project its
                        strength outward to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>17. In Europe, Greece and Turkey, with their significant forces, are being
                        successfully integrated in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>;
                        Greek-Turkish-Yugoslav military cooperation is beginning to develop; the
                        juridical basis for Western German rearmament is being established; and
                        Spain’s participation in Western defense plans is a developing prospect.
                        However, our major European allies, particularly the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> and <pb xml:id="pg_77" n="77" facs="0107"/>France, are
                        encountering serious difficulties in seeking both to make a fully adequate
                        contribution to the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to
                        support their existing responsibilities outside Europe. The volume and
                        timing in the delivery of U.S. assistance is a major factor in determining
                        the size and timing of the effective force goals which can actually be
                        achieved. On balance, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments,
                        and such additional declarations as those of the U.S. and its allies
                        concerning Berlin, together with European efforts and U.S. assistance, have
                        made it clear that military action by the USSR or its satellites would
                        almost certainly lead to general war (except possibly in the case of
                        Finland). It is therefore unlikely that the Soviet orbit will take military
                        action there unless it is prepared to engage in general war.</p>
                    <p>18. Apart from the above problem of military capabilities, the Western
                        European powers continue to be confronted with serious political, economic
                        and social problems despite the great advances, with U.S. assistance,
                        towards greater stability and cohesion. These problems have derived from
                        economic conditions, political instability, neutralist tendencies, social
                        tensions, and, in France and Italy, the continued existence of large and
                        powerful Communist parties. Although genuine progress has been made, further
                        efforts and U.S. assistance to the Western European countries will be
                        required to overcome these adverse elements and to continue the progress
                        towards political and social stability, economic integration, and collective
                        defense in Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>19. Present and threatened communist aggression and subversion in the Far
                        East and Middle East currently pose more immediate dangers to the free world
                        position.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. In the Middle East, efforts to maintain or enhance political
                            stability have not succeeded. Recent developments in Iran, and to a
                            lesser extent Egypt, have emphasized the danger that trends in this area
                            may lead to the denial of the resources of this area to the free world’s
                            security efforts and eventually to the loss of important countries to
                            Communist control. Western military forces in the area are now limited,
                            and the U.S. may soon have to give serious consideration to the problem
                            of assuming additional responsibilities in the area.</item>
                        <item>b. In South Asia and the Far East, the inexperience of the present
                            leadership and lack of a firm popular base hampers the ability of
                            various countries to strengthen themselves internally and to cope with
                            communist and extremist pressures. The continued rise of nationalism in
                            these areas has created divisive conflicts. This nationalism represents
                            a reaction against former or remaining colonial controls and creates
                            weaknesses in the free world as a whole.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_78" n="78" facs="0108"/>
                    <p>c. In Indochina, where the situation is most acute, an increase of strength
                        has enabled the French Union forces to stand off the communists but has not
                        brought them within sight of success.</p>
                    <p>Thus in the Middle and Far East, the USSR, by instigating direct or indirect
                        aggression, can force the Western powers to choose among (a) suffering the
                        loss of these areas by default, (b) fighting defensive local action for
                        limited objectives, or (c) treating local aggression as a cause for general
                        war. In the Middle and Far East we have not yet succeeded in developing aid
                        programs with the degree of flexibility and relationship with political
                        factors required to make them highly effective in producing stability. We
                        must concentrate particularly on so designing our aid programs that they
                        will contribute to the solution of critical problems in unstable areas which
                        the use of allied military forces cannot solve.</p>
                    <p>20. Despite the vital interest of the free world, adequate measures to deal
                        with a sudden worsening of situations in the Far and Middle East are not now
                        in readiness under present programs, priorities and force levels. In the
                        circumstances, the questions arise (a) whether these serious threats can be
                        met by a redistribution of the free world’s effort presently programmed, or
                        (b) whether consideration must be given to increasing the total effort, or
                        (c) both.</p>
                    <p>21. Over the next several years, with the accumulation on both sides of
                        atomic and other mass destruction weapons, the developing situation may
                        present a continuing and possibly improved opportunity for Soviet expansion
                        by the techniques of political warfare and local aggression if the fear and
                        threat of general war paralyzes the free world’s reaction to such local
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>22. In the light of the present threats and foreseeable developments, as
                        outlined above, it appears that the ability of the free world to maintain
                        its position and progress toward its objectives will come increasingly to
                        depend upon: (a) its capacity to stand firm against Soviet political warfare
                        despite the threat of increasing Soviet atomic capabilities, (b) a greater
                        capability and greater willingness than have been demonstrated to commit
                        appropriate forces and material for limited objectives, and (c) its ability
                        to develop greater stability in peripheral and other unstable areas.</p>
                    <p>23. Outside the Soviet orbit there exists a need for increased and more
                        selective political warfare operations by the United States and its allies
                        to combat:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The threat of local communist parties, which remains serious
                            although the United States and its allies have demonstrated the ability
                            to penetrate and weaken communist organizations and to reduce the
                            communist potential for revolution and sabotage.</item>
                        <item>b. USSR propaganda directed with particular force against the United
                            States.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_79" n="79" facs="0109"/>
                        <item>c. In many parts of the world, distrust of the United States which
                            weakens affirmative support for the purposes of the United
                            States.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>24. Against the Soviet orbit itself, by skillful execution, the United States
                        and its allies can sap the morale of satellite leaders and encourage rifts
                        between the USSR and the satellite countries, and over a period of years may
                        gradually force the Kremlin to an increasing preoccupation with internal
                        security. By appropriate economic measures, the U.S. and its allies can help
                        to deprive the Soviet orbit of needed resources and retard the development
                        of Soviet orbit military potential. It should be recognized, however, that
                        these measures alone, however vigorously pursued, against the Soviet orbit,
                        cannot be counted on drastically to reduce the threat which the Soviet
                        system poses to the free world.</p>
                    <p>25. During the next few years, it is unlikely that meaningful agreements can
                        be negotiated with the USSR, for the Kremlin will probably not feel that the
                        power relationship obliges it to make significant concessions to the free
                        world. This situation could change in the course of time, particularly if
                        Germany and Japan were to be restored to strength and firmly aligned with
                        the free world; but during the next several years the prospect for
                        negotiation of lasting agreements is negligible, although specific
                        agreements on a <hi rend="italic">quid-pro-quo</hi> basis, such as an
                        armistice in Korea, are not precluded. Nevertheless, development of a sound
                        U.S. negotiating position in any question or dispute involving the USSR
                        would help to convince the world of the validity and sincerity of our
                        position and would serve as a political warfare weapon.</p>
                    <p>26. While recognizing the admitted strength of the Soviet world and the as
                        yet undeveloped strength and obvious weaknesses of the free world, it
                        appears clear that the free world has made progress toward building a power
                        position which would be capable of (a) persuading the Soviets against a
                        general war; (b) reducing the opportunities for local Soviet aggression and
                        political warfare; and (c) exploiting rifts between the USSR and other
                        communist states and between the several communist regimes and the peoples
                        they are oppressing, and thus possibly offering to certain satellite peoples
                        the prospect of liberation without war.</p>
                    <p>27. We therefore continue to believe that the free world with its superior
                        resources should be able to build and maintain for whatever length of time
                        proves to be necessary, such strength that the Soviet orbit will be unable
                        to make significant advances in expanding its power, either geographically,
                        or politically, and that if the free world develops such strength, the
                        internal conflicts of the Soviet totalitarian system should, with positive
                        effort from us, force <pb xml:id="pg_80" n="80" facs="0110"/>a retraction of
                        Soviet power and influence and eventually cause that system gradually to
                        weaken and decay, although no time limit can be established by which these
                        latter objectives must be achieved.</p>
                    <p>28. The building and maintenance of free world strength will, however,
                        require a re-examination of the adequacy of current U.S. national security
                        programs from the standpoint of size, relative priority, and
                            allocation.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">At its meeting on Thursday

                    <p>1. Reappraisal of United States objectives and strategy for national security
                        reaffirms the basic purposes and policies of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 20, 68 and 114 Series. The fundamental purpose of the
                        United States remains as stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68:
                        to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society founded upon the
                        dignity and worth of the individual. Pursuit of this fundamental purpose
                        should continue to be through that general policy which seeks:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To develop throughout the world positive appeals superior to those
                            of communism.</item>
                        <item>b. Even at grave risk of general war, to block further expansion of
                            Soviet power.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_82" n="82" facs="0112"/>
                        <item>c. By all means short of general war to induce a retraction of the
                            Kremlin’s control and influence, and so to foster the seeds of
                            destruction within the Soviet system that the Kremlin is brought at
                            least to the point of modifying its behavior to conform to generally
                            accepted international standards.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. We continue to believe that the free world with its superior resources
                        should be able to build and maintain, for whatever length of time proves to
                        be necessary, such strength that the Soviet orbit will be unable to make
                        significant advances in expanding its power, either geographically or
                        politically. Moreover if the free world develops such strength, the internal
                        conflicts of the Soviet totalitarian system should, with positive effort
                        from us, subsequently cause a retraction of Soviet power and influence and
                        eventually cause that system gradually to weaken and decay, although no time
                        limit can be established by which these objectives will be achieved.</p>
                    <p>3. Although no fundamental departures from the conclusions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20 and 68 Series are required, it is
                        essential that we take into account certain factors that have developed or
                        acquired new significance since the adoption of these reports:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The United States and its major allies have responded to the
                            perilous situation of 1950; they have responded collectively to the
                            attack upon South Korea; they are improving the security position in
                            Western Europe and in the Pacific; they, and particularly the United
                            States, have significantly improved their readiness for war. These
                            efforts, though not yet complete, have already reenforced the deterrents
                            to general war and reaffirmed the reasoning of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 68 by which both preventive war and isolation were
                            rejected as courses of action.</item>
                        <item>b. There has also been a substantial further development of Soviet
                            orbit strength since 1950. Modernization and expansion programs in the
                            Soviet, satellite, and Chinese Communist armed forces are proceeding,
                            supported by a rapidly growing economic and industrial capacity and by a
                            high level of scientific and technical capability in selected fields of
                            vital military importance. As a result of the developing atomic and
                            possible thermonuclear capability of the USSR, the vulnerability of the
                            United States to direct attack, which is now serious, will in a few
                            years probably assume critical proportions. The same reasoning would
                            apply in general to the defensive position of the Soviet orbit.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. In the light of these concurrent developments, it must remain the
                        immediate and, we believe, attainable objective of the free world to
                        maintain such over-all strength as will (a) confront the Kremlin with the
                        prospect that a Soviet attack would result in serious risk to the Soviet
                        regime, (b) reduce the opportunities for local Soviet or satellite
                        aggression and political warfare, and (c) permit the exploitation of rifts
                        between the USSR and other communist <pb xml:id="pg_83" n="83" facs="0113"
                        />states and between the satellite regimes and the peoples they are
                        oppressing. The United States should accordingly pursue with determination
                        and constancy the courses of action set forth in the following
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Deterrent to General War</p>
                    <p>5. The United States should develop and maintain, in cooperation with its
                        allies, a position of strength, flexibility and depth adequate to deter the
                        Soviets from deliberately initiating general war and to discourage them from
                        pursuing courses of action involving grave risk of general war.</p>
                    <p>6. To achieve such a deterrent, the United States should take the necessary
                        measures to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Develop the political unity of and encourage the growth of strength
                            and determination in the free world so as to minimize the likelihood
                            that the Soviets would believe they could undertake local aggression
                            without serious risk of war.</item>

                            capability to deliver an offensive of sufficient power to inflict
                            massive damage on the Soviet war-making capacity.</item>
                        <item>c. Assure ready defensive strength adequate to provide in the event of
                            general war a reasonable initial defense and to ensure reasonable
                            protection to the nation during the period of mobilization for ultimate
                            victory.</item>
                        <item>d. Round out and maintain the mobilization base, both military and
                            industrial, in the United States at a level which in the event of need
                            will enable us to expand rapidly to full mobilization; and, consistent
                            with the maintenance of a vital and democratic society, provide the
                            means for protecting the mobilization base against covert attack and
                            sabotage.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>7. The United States should develop a substantially improved civil defense in
                        the light of the capacity of the USSR to deliver an atomic and possible
                        thermonuclear attack against the United States, in order to (a) provide
                        reasonable protection for the American people and maintain their morale,
                        thereby enhancing the freedom of action of the U.S. Government, and (b)
                        increase the capability of the country’s economy to recover from such an
                        attack. At the same time the American people must be brought to a
                        recognition of the need to accept and live with a substantial degree of
                        vulnerability.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Outside the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>8. A preliminary study of problems in the areas outside the Soviet orbit
                        brings out some major causes of concern which indicate the need for a
                        restudy and possible change of emphasis and redirection of certain of our
                        efforts with respect to those areas. These causes of concern are:</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_84" n="84" facs="0114"/>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Whether our major European allies, particularly the United Kingdom
                            and France, have the political and economic capacity (a) to make a fully
                            adequate contribution to the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and (b) to support their existing responsibilities
                            outside of Europe.</item>
                        <item>b. The readily deployable reserve strength of the United States and
                            its allies, together with present indigenous political and military
                            strength in areas on the periphery of the Soviet orbit, is insufficient
                            to permit us to escape from the possibility of having to choose, in the
                            face of local aggression, either the eventual further expansion of
                            Soviet power, inconclusive local counteraction, or general war.</item>
                        <item>c. Serious internal instability in many areas, caused in varying
                            degrees by the activities of indigenous communist parties, rabid
                            nationalism, economic and political backwardness, and defeatist
                            neutralism, and stimulated by aggressive Soviet and satellite propaganda
                            directed chiefly against the United States, threatens to create
                            conditions where communist influence and control may be extended without
                            Soviet aggression unless effective counter measures are taken.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>9. In the light of the above, the United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Reexamine the amounts and allocations of resources to various areas
                            in terms of kind, quantity, timing and priority, to determine (1)
                            whether a general increase in the level of free world programs and
                            military forces is required to deal with the several threats; (2)
                            whether the present allocation of resources as between U.S. military
                            forces and other free world forces is appropriate; (3) whether the
                            present balance between military assistance and the various types of
                            economic assistance is appropriate; and (4) whether these allocations
                            are in proper relationship to the threats facing the United States in
                            Europe, the Far East and the Middle East, to the importance of these
                            areas for U.S. security, and to United States commitments. The results
                            of this reexamination should be reflected in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> report called for by the President by October 1,
                            1952.</item>
                        <item>b. Be increasingly willing to commit military forces or material, as
                            appropriate and in cooperation with its allies, in support of its
                            objectives in specific geographic areas, and to this end include in the
                            reexamination under paragraph 9–a above the necessary study of
                            requirements and capabilities. At the same time the United States should
                            encourage and as appropriate assist in the development of indigenous
                            forces and regional defense arrangements capable of bearing an
                            increasing share of responsibility for resisting local communist
                            aggression. When U.S. forces are committed to combat a local aggression,
                            the action should whenever possible be of sufficient strength and scope
                            to effect a decision favorable to the United States.</item>
                        <item>c. Increase its efforts to promote internal stability in critical
                            areas outside the Soviet orbit. Here the United States should conduct,
                            with greater vigor, political warfare operations as an integral part of
                            its over-all strategy, in order to reduce communist and neutralist
                            influence, combat anti-American propaganda, and create stronger support
                            for the purposes of United States foreign policy. <pb xml:id="pg_85"
                                n="85" facs="0115"/>Particular emphasis should be placed on measures
                            directed against the effectiveness of local communist parties.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Within the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>10. Where operations can be conducted on terms which may result in a relative
                        decrease in Soviet power without involving unacceptable risks, the United
                        States should pursue and as practicable intensify positive political,
                        economic, propaganda, and paramilitary operations against the Soviet orbit,
                        particularly those operations designed to weaken Kremlin control over the
                        satellites and the military potential of the Soviet system. However, we
                        should not over-estimate the effectiveness of the activities we can pursue
                        within the Soviet orbit, and should proceed with a careful weighing of the
                        risks against the possible gains in pressing upon what the Kremlin probably
                        regards as its vital interests.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Measures</p>
                    <p>11. The United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Utilize its economic power wherever feasible to facilitate the
                            growth of strength, stability and unity in the free world. The provision
                            of economic assistance designed to achieve these objectives should be
                            closely coordinated with military and political measures and aid should
                            be allocated in the light of the reexamination called for in paragraph
                            9, above.</item>
                        <item>b. Be prepared to utilize its economic resources to forestall or, if
                            necessary, to resolve favorably political crises which pose a threat to
                            U.S. security interests, particularly those arising in a context which
                            precludes the effective use of allied or U.S. military forces.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Support</p>
                    <p>12. The United States should undertake systematically and consistently a
                        program of clarifying to the American public and to other peoples of the
                        free world the complex problems of the free world in meeting the Soviet
                        threat, the nature of that threat, the strength and resources the free world
                        possesses to meet that threat, and to the extent possible the reasoning
                        behind the general lines of policy and action described herein, in order to
                        secure that public understanding and support which is essential to the
                        success of our policies and actions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiation</p>
                    <p>13. The United States, in cooperation with its allies, should develop a sound
                        negotiating position in any question or dispute involving the USSR and
                        should be prepared to enter into negotiations with the Soviet Union if they
                        offer promise of achieving acceptable <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi,</hi>
                        or if, for other reasons, they appear to be desirable. On the other hand we
                        should recognize that only enforceable agreements are meaningful and that
                        the major contributions <pb xml:id="pg_86" n="86" facs="0116"/>of
                        negotiation in the foreseeable future may be to convince the world of the
                        validity and sincerity of our position and to serve as a political warfare
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mobilization Policy</p>
                    <p>14. The United States should continue to pursue a policy of limited
                        mobilization designed to develop and maintain a favorable power position
                        without resort to an armament effort so large as to disrupt the economies of
                        the free nations. Such a power position should be sufficient to (1) maximize
                        the chance that general war will be indefinitely postponed, (2) provide an
                        effective counter to local aggression in key peripheral areas, and (3)
                        provide the basis for winning a general war should it occur.</p>
                    <p>15. It continues to be impracticable to fix a tentative D-day by which our
                        preparations for war should be at their peak, although there are estimated
                        time periods within which measures must be taken to reduce or eliminate
                        vulnerabilities of a critical nature.</p>
                    <p>16. The adequacy of currently projected mobilization goals is a question
                        separate from that of the soundness of the concept of limited mobilization.
                        Appraisal of the present goals must be accomplished on a continuing basis as
                        the various programs are fulfilled and in light of changes in the world
                        situation. The rapid growth of the Soviet atomic capability, the prospect
                        for our continued heavy commitment in Korea, the serious threat to Southeast
                        Asia, the danger of further deterioration of the situations in Iran and
                        Egypt, the grave implications of further Soviet efforts to force the Western
                        powers out of Berlin—all of these portents underline the risks involved in
                        the projected rates of delivery and in adhering to presently programmed
                        force levels.</p>
                    <p>17. Recognizing the above risks and objectives in the light of the situation
                        facing us, and recognizing that acceleration and upward adjustment of our
                        national security programs as a whole, if necessary, are well within our
                        capacity and can be accomplished without serious adverse effects on the U.S.
                        economy, the United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Assure the acceleration of the production of selected military end

                        <item>b. Place continued high emphasis upon selected scientific and

                        is, I think, in harmony with the policy paper. The “Summary and
                            Conclusions”<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">Reference is to the Draft
                            Statement Submitted to the Senior Staff, Aug. 12, <ref target="#pg_73"

                        two staff papers.</p>
                    <p>There is only one point in the paper as a whole on which <gloss
                            target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> still has any doubts and that is the portion
                        dealing with civil air defense, paragraph 60 in Part II of the Staff Study
                        and the corresponding paragraph in the summary of the conclusions. They feel
                        that the last sentence warning against applying a disproportionate amount of
                        resources to defensive purposes is unnecessary and possibly misleading in
                        that our efforts in this field are far from adequate and that the warning
                        therefore is unnecessary. I do not feel that this is too important since the
                        major parts of the paragraphs deal with the necessity of further and
                        improved efforts in the field of civilian defense and it is one that Defense
                        and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> seem to feel rather strongly about.
                        However, you may wish to discuss it with <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>
                        and you could, of course, at the Council meeting propose some rewording.
                        Aside from this point, I believe that the paper is acceptable to the
                        Department as it stands and I would have no suggestions for changes at the
                        Council meeting. Mr. Walmsley and Mr. <persName>Smith</persName>

                        believe is shared by the other Departments, is that this could best be done
                        by a special group set up under the President’s direction by the Secretaries
                        of State and Defense with the participation of other directly interested

                        budgetary submissions called for by the President by October first. It is,
                        of course, obvious that any such study could not possibly be completed by
                        October first so that the <hi rend="italic">last sentence of paragraph

                        Senior Staff as to the material that this reexamination would encompass. Our
                        view, supported by Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> with
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> uncertain, is that this examination
                        should be made on the basis of the programs recommended by October first to
                        the President for fiscal 1954. If in certain aspects the reexamination could
                        be completed in time to possibly have some effect on the fiscal 1954 budget,
                        it could be used for that purpose. If not, as is more probable in view of
                        the time element, there might at least be guidelines for possible increases
                        or revisions through a supplementary budget or at least guidelines for the
                        preparation of fiscal 1955. If you approve of this procedure, there is a
                        draft Presidential Order, prepared by <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>,
                        calling for the necessary mechanism which you could submit to the Council

                        honestly feel that it is in as good shape as it possibly could be and still
                        be agreed by all Departments and agencies concerned. In fact, I consider
                        that the paper as a whole represents a good analysis and recommendations for
                        the situation in the world that we face in the foreseeable future.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Bases of Soviet Action</p>
                    <p>1. Whatever the estimate (and the field is, of course, highly speculative) of
                        Soviet future actions or long-range and short-range intentions, there are
                        certain fundamental features of the Soviet system which are generally
                        uncontested by all analyses. There may be, as there have been, wide tactical
                        swings in Soviet policy, but these features of the Soviet system are
                        fundamental and unchanging:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The USSR is a totalitarian state, heavily armed and continuously
                            seeking to increase its military potential, where the power of decision
                            rests entirely in the hands of a small group of men. Whatever their
                            ultimate ambitions may be, we can say at a minimum that these men seek
                            to develop the power of the Soviet system relative to the non-Soviet
                            world so that the security of their regime cannot be externally
                            challenged or menaced.</item>
                        <item>b. By the nature of its state structure, reinforced by its ideology,
                            the USSR is fundamentally and unappeasably hostile to any society not
                            susceptible to its control and consequently will exploit any opportunity
                            to weaken its enemies and increase its own power position in so far as
                            the Soviet rulers deem such action to be compatible with the security of
                            the regime.</item>
                        <item>c. The directing group of the Soviet Government and of international
                            communism is totally uninhibited by any consideration of a humanitarian,
                            moral or ethical character.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>These fundamental features of the Soviet system, regardless of the particular
                        tactical phase of Soviet policy, make it clear that an imbalance of power in
                        favor of the Soviet bloc presents a critical threat to the free nations of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>2. In assessing the bases of Soviet action, we can draw one general
                        conclusion from an historical analysis of Soviet policy. It is that
                        throughout their history the Bolshevik leaders of Soviet Russia <pb
                            xml:id="pg_90" n="90" facs="0120"/>have never been deflected by
                        Communist doctrine from taking whatever immediate steps they believed
                        necessary to consolidate and enhance their position and power in the USSR.
                        The Soviet regime came to power in October 1917 with what the Bolsheviks
                        considered to be a clear, thoroughly thought-out thesis, or doctrine, which
                        described the direction of the future course of world history. In seizing
                        power by a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> rather than by a mass
                        uprising, and in a country which had none of the doctrinaire prerequisites
                        for socialism, Lenin immediately violated the inherited doctrine and
                            <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> has continued to do so
                        ever since. Indeed, the life of the Soviet regime has been in continual
                        contradiction with pre-existing doctrine and, in essence, Soviet actions
                        have represented an unending series of compromises as, with each concrete
                        situation facing them, the Soviets have attempted to resolve these
                        contradictions. The moment they seized power they discovered that inherited
                        doctrine was inadequate to answer the question as to how to exercise power
                        in that country, under those circumstances, at that time. In the effort to
                        consolidate the power attained and to achieve absolute control over the
                        captured state, Lenin sacrificed pre-existing doctrine to considerations of
                        the winning and holding of power. <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> has continued to do so, and whenever a conflict has
                        arisen between doctrine (in the sense of the revolutionary ideology) and any
                        question of the security of the regime, the latter has prevailed without
                        exception. Where Lenin, however, acknowledged these sacrifices as such,
                            <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> has twisted the
                        doctrine to fit the needs of power. His policies therefore have been
                        opportunistic in the sense that he has not hesitated, even at the cost of
                        twisting the doctrine, to take advantage of every opportunity to preserve
                        and strengthen the security of the regime and develop the power of the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>3. Similarly, the necessity of maintaining power at home has always taken
                        precedence over the interest in revolution abroad. Due to the dual nature of
                        the Soviet State, the same men are at once the rulers of the Soviet Union
                        and the board of directors of an international conspiracy. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>’s method of reconciling foreign
                        Communists to the subordination of the interests of world revolution to
                        those of the Soviet State has been by claiming that these interests are
                        identical and by forcing obedience to the concept that the first duty of
                        Communists everywhere is to defend the Soviet Union. To date no substantial
                        sacrifice has been made for the benefit of the world revolutionary movement
                        at the expense of the security of the regime. However, great sacrifices have
                        been made to develop the power of the Soviet system, which could be used to
                        expand the area under Soviet control. It is unnecessary, however, to state
                        dogmatically that the <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>
                        regime is interested in maintaining power in Russia entirely for the sake of
                        power and not at <pb xml:id="pg_91" n="91" facs="0121"/>all as a base for
                        eventual world revolution, since for the foreseeable future they amount to
                        the same thing, and since power at the center is in any case a precondition
                        to Soviet expansion. The prime preoccupation of the masters of the Kremlin,
                        whatever their ambitions may be, must remain the security of the home base
                        and the development of its power, for there is no realistic sign that in the
                        foreseeable future the internal or external situation will undergo such
                        radical alteration as to remove this prime preoccupation from their
                        minds.</p>
                    <p>4. Furthermore, the specific nature of the <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName>ist regime makes it probable that any Communist regime
                        not susceptible of control by the Soviet Union would be potentially hostile
                        to it. The relationship of the Soviet Union with other Communist states
                        which it cannot control is a subject of extreme complexity and one on which
                        we have very little evidence to base any firm conclusions, but as Tito
                        illustrates, the mere fact of being Communist does not eliminate the
                        possibility of a hostile relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>5. To say that the doctrine of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin does
                        not provide any sure guide to Soviet action, in the sense of cause and
                        effect, does not mean that that doctrine does not have an effect of [<hi
                            rend="italic">on</hi>] Soviet action. The effect is indirect but
                        nonetheless real. It has served as the rationalization and justification of
                        Soviet actions which were actually taken for other reasons. By this fact
                        alone it conditions to an important degree the manner in which actions are
                        often taken. Marxist-Leninist doctrine is also the bait that attracts
                        supporters abroad. In one field, furthermore, it has a very important
                        effect, and that is in the field of analysis of situations in non-Soviet
                        countries. Available information indicates that for the Soviet rulers
                        Marxist-Leninist doctrine forms the basis for their analysis of the
                        development of capitalist society, rivalries between capitalist powers, and
                        the relationship between “colonial powers and colonial or semi-colonial
                        peoples”. It is in relation to their view of non-Soviet countries that
                        Marxist-Leninist doctrine plays its greatest role and contains the greatest
                        possibility of serious Soviet miscalculation as to the reaction of other
                        countries. (Finland and Korea provide examples of such miscalculations.)
                        This doctrinaire approach to the outside world has many other indirect
                        effects in connection with Soviet activities. It is the basis on which the
                        idea of an aggressive and hostile world is constantly kept before the eyes
                        of the people under their control. Like other aspects of Soviet theory, the
                        doctrinaire approach to the outside world contains two contradictory theses:
                        On the one hand, it is the rationalization and justification of the
                        consistently maintained propaganda thesis, both at home and abroad, that the
                        capitalist world is constantly planning aggression against the Soviet Union;
                            <pb xml:id="pg_92" n="92" facs="0122"/>on the other hand, it is an
                        integral part of doctrine that the internal and external contradictions of
                        capitalist societies prevent their leaders from taking unified and vigorous
                        action.</p>
                    <p>6. General war is clearly not something into which the Soviet rulers would
                        enter lightly. One of the chief factors which they would obviously consider
                        would be the relative strength of the enemy. But even if the Soviet military
                        position is favorable relative to the West’s, they must regard a major war
                        as involving risks to the Soviet regime, for such reasons as the added
                        strain on the economy and the control of the satellites, the increased
                        problem of defection, and, most serious of all, a possible altering to the
                        detriment of the party of the relationship between party and army, for
                        control over the army is one of the principal cornerstones of the survival
                        of the regime.</p>
                    <p>7. An understandable reluctance to enter into general war does not mean that
                        the nature of the Soviet system, reinforced by its ideology, permits
                        genuinely peaceful or normal relations with non-Soviet countries. Struggle
                        and tension are the natural environments of such a system. A hostile
                        environment especially abroad, is a necessity for the maintenance of the
                        Soviet system and is not necessarily related to the achievement of any
                        specific foreign policy objective. The “cold war” relationship with
                        non-Soviet countries is not a postwar phenomenon; it began with the seizure
                        of power by the Bolshevik party in November 1917. Preoccupied with the
                        problems of maintaining iron discipline over the captive peoples, the Soviet
                        rulers are obliged to justify such disciplines by the bogey of “capitalist
                        encirclement” and the stated goal of world revolution. A tranquil
                        relationship with the outside world then becomes impossible and their
                        expansionist tendencies spring from a desire to push the edge of freedom
                        farther and farther away.</p>
                    <p>8. In the foregoing analysis no attempt has been made to draw all possible
                        conclusions covering Soviet actions in all conceivable circumstances since
                        to do so would involve such widespread speculation as to make the result
                        virtually meaningless. It is rather an attempt, based on the pattern of past
                        and present Soviet conduct and in the light of available information, to
                        indicate the most reasonable probabilities as to the type of situations
                        under which Soviet action initiating or leading to war might occur. Our
                        analysis shows that a power imbalance in favor of the Soviet Union involves
                        real risks of war. There is, of course, no certainty that past and present
                        patterns of Soviet conduct will continue indefinitely into the future, but
                        it is highly unlikely that any radical departure from this pattern will
                        occur unless it is preceded by an event of major importance, such as the
                        death of <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>, or a radical
                        shift in present world alignment which would in itself require a
                        reexamination <pb xml:id="pg_93" n="93" facs="0123"/>of the entire paper.
                        With this thought in mind, the following may be stated:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. If the Soviet rulers should attain, in their judgment, the
                            capability of defeating the United States or of so reducing its power
                            potential as to render it permanently incapable of effectively
                            challenging Soviet power, and if they should come to believe that such
                            action would not involve serious risk to the maintenance of their
                            regime, they would probably deliberately initiate general war.</item>
                        <item>b. The Soviets might attack the West if they were convinced as a
                            matter of fact, rather than theory, that an attack by the West was
                            actually imminent.</item>
                        <item>c. War could come from communist action based on initial Soviet
                            miscalculation of the free world’s interest and reaction to the
                            situation in some particular area (see paragraph 5 above).</item>
                        <item>d. War could come from a deadlocked situation in which basic interests
                            of both parties are involved with an act of one side setting off an
                            unwinding chain of action and reaction which neither side would be able
                            fully to control.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The statements in subparagraphs a through d above deal with the circumstances
                        under which the Soviet Union would be most likely to initiate general war,
                        or under which general war is most likely to occur. They are not designed to
                        cover all of the infinite range of possible circumstances, actions and
                        counteractions that might lead to the outbreak of general hostilities. It
                        must be assumed that the Soviet Union would be prepared to use military
                        action to defend areas presently under its control deemed vital to Soviet
                        security interests. Nor can it ever be totally excluded that if in the eyes
                        of the Soviet leaders developments in the power balance appeared directly
                        and imminently to threaten the security of the Soviet Union or areas under
                        its control, they might feel compelled to force certain outstanding issues
                        in such a way that the result might well be the outbreak of war without any
                        deliberate intention on the part of the Soviet Union to bring about such an
                        event.</p>
                    <p>9. Although there remains a serious risk of general war, it is our present
                        view that the most immediate dangers are of such a progressive and
                        cumulative loss of positions of importance (either as a result of
                        deterioration within the free nations or of communist cold war actions or a
                        process involving both) that the United States would eventually be reduced
                        to an isolated and relatively impotent position.</p>
                    <p>10. In assessing the danger of local expansion, the following represent
                        certain Soviet criteria, all of which should be present before the Soviet
                        Union would be likely to employ Soviet or satellite forces in overt military
                        action against non-Soviet territory. It should be noted both that the
                        Soviets have miscalculated in the past (as in Finland and Korea) and may
                        again misjudge situations <pb xml:id="pg_94" n="94" facs="0124"/>and also
                        that these conditions, even if met, do not necessarily impel direct
                        exploitative action. These criteria are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) That the territory’s accession to Soviet power would have a direct
                            and important effect in improving the Soviet strategic position;</item>
                        <item>(2) That the territory could be brought under total <persName
                                corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>ist control;</item>
                        <item>(3) That the internal situation would be such in Soviet eyes as to
                            provide the cover of revolutionary or civil war activity for the
                            intervention of Soviet or satellite forces;</item>
                        <item>(4) That the use of open armed force would not carry with it a major
                            risk of general hostilities involving the Soviet Union.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The foregoing criteria are not necessarily equally applicable to Chinese
                        Communist action. We do not have sufficient evidence concerning the degree
                        of Soviet control over the Chinese Communist regime to justify applying
                        these criteria directly to possible Chinese Communist actions. Furthermore
                        the Chinese Communist regime, only recently installed in power, presumably
                        has more initial revolutionary fervor and less cold-blooded realism and
                        discipline than the present <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                        >Stalin</persName>ist regime.</p>

                            sense, including psychological warfare, subversion, political and

                            etc. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> against the non-Soviet world.
                        Should the Kremlin in the future launch a major effort to relax
                        international tension, the tempo of Soviet political warfare may be
                        ostensibly reduced and its methods may become more subtle. In one form or
                        another, however, Soviet political warfare against the free world will
                        continue so long as the Soviet system retains its present basic
                        character.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Soviet Political Warfare Capabilities</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>12. In conducting political warfare the Kremlin has at its disposal the
                        political and economic resources of the Soviet state and the satellites, the
                        network of Communist parties throughout the world, and the Soviet and
                        satellite military potentials. The Kremlin’s political warfare capabilities
                        derive from its ability to employ at will, either separately or in concert,
                        all of these elements:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. With its rigorous control over the political and economic life of
                            the Soviet state the Kremlin can profess to pursue—and often appear to
                            pursue—domestic policies which have wide popular <pb xml:id="pg_95"
                                n="95" facs="0125"/>appeal abroad. With its elaborate world-wide
                            propaganda machinery and its unique ability to conceal the realities of
                            the Soviet orbit from foreign observation the USSR can pose, with
                            considerable effect, as the champion of peace and as the pioneer in many
                            laudable social and economic endeavors. The effectiveness of such
                            appeals among the more uneducated and underprivileged peoples of former
                            “colonial” areas of Asia, the Near East and Africa has been
                            demonstrated.</item>
                        <item>b. The USSR enjoys greater flexibility than the West in the conduct of
                            foreign policy because of its greater control over public opinion and
                            its control over the European satellites. It can opportunistically
                            exploit the differences among the Western Powers. It can stimulate
                            tendencies toward “neutralism” by playing upon the desires of many
                            peoples and governments to avoid involvement in a major struggle between
                            the great powers. It has considerable tactical flexibility in attempting
                            to force its adversaries to choose between difficult
                            alternatives.</item>
                        <item>c. With its virtually absolute control over the economic resources of
                            the USSR and the European satellites, the Kremlin can offer economic
                            inducements, extend economic favors and apply economic pressures in
                            support of its political warfare efforts.</item>
                        <item>d. The unique facilities of the international communist movement and
                            communist front organizations provide the Kremlin with a world-wide
                            system of strategically placed sounding boards, capable of picking up
                            and amplifying Soviet propaganda themes. These Party and front elements
                            can stimulate “peace” campaigns, and agitate for disarmament and
                            prohibitions against the use of mass destruction weapons. By mobilizing
                            mass pressure groups or penetrating key organizations and government
                            agencies, they can influence official policy. This potential is at
                            present especially serious in France and Italy, and may become so in
                            Japan. By provoking labor disturbances they can impair economic health.
                            By inciting local antagonisms they can weaken political stability. And
                            they have the capability of undertaking missions of espionage, sabotage
                            and open violence.</item>
                        <item>e. The Kremlin’s political warfare capabilities are supported by
                            world-wide fears of the Soviet military potential, which is used to
                            intimidate the USSR’s neighbors and inhibit the Western Powers from
                            boldly countering the Kremlin’s political warfare operations.</item>
                        <item>f. The capability of the USSR to threaten local regimes by instigating
                            guerrilla activity and other subversive measures may force the Western
                            Powers to choose between suffering the loss of key peripheral areas by
                            default or committing military forces in an effort to maintain the <hi

                    </list>
                    <p>13. Under conditions of general war all of the Kremlin’s political warfare
                        resources would be mobilized to hamper the Western effort. The Kremlin
                        probably would seek to manipulate the circumstances surrounding the outbreak
                        of hostilities to make it appear that the war was unnecessary, and that it
                        had been brought about by the design of Western leaders against the
                        interests of their peoples, thereby detracting from the unity and will of
                        the free world <pb xml:id="pg_96" n="96" facs="0126"/>effort. At the same
                        time, “hard core” Communist cells in the West would attempt to carry out
                        industrial and military sabotage and espionage, provoke labor disturbances,
                        to stir up racial strife, and to undermine the morale of Western armed

                    </p>
                    <p>14. The Soviet Orbit’s political warfare vulnerabilities stem in part from
                        some of the same factors which contribute to its capabilities. The Soviet
                        system is highly dependent on its rigid, centralized control machinery. It
                        relies heavily on the elaborate false facade of political progress at home,
                        of enlightened and high-minded policies abroad, of invincible economic and
                        military power, and of the infallibility of Communist doctrine and Soviet
                        leadership. To the extent that this control machinery can be disrupted and
                        the myths out of which this facade is built can be discredited, Soviet
                        political capabilities abroad will be damaged and the Soviet system at home
                        weakened.</p>
                    <p>15. Potential vulnerabilities in the USSR and the European satellites which
                        might be exploited by political warfare include the following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Disillusionment and resentment in both the USSR and the European
                            satellites over exactions, repressions and personal helplessness and
                            insecurity.</item>
                        <item>b. Resentment of the rural populations over official agricultural
                            policy.</item>
                        <item>c. Hostility of minority Soviet nationalities to Kremlin
                            rule.</item>
                        <item>d. Stifled initiative and mutual distrust among virtually all elements
                            of the population, including the Politburo itself, resulting from the
                            fear and suspicion aroused by Party and police surveillance.</item>
                        <item>e. Resentment of the satellite peoples over domination and
                            exploitation by the USSR, and especially over the heavy economic burdens
                            which Soviet-dictated policies have imposed on the satellite
                            populations.</item>
                        <item>f. The highly centralized nature of official control machinery, the
                            thorough disruption of which could result in the serious weakening of
                            the Soviet state structure.</item>
                        <item>g. Exposure of Soviet methods of seizing and maintaining control over
                            the satellites, which can serve as a powerful incentive for other small
                            nations to resist Soviet overtures or communist penetration.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Some of these vulnerabilities already exist with respect to Communist China
                        and others may develop.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Political Warfare Assets and Capabilities of the Free
                            World</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>16. The growing realization that the military power and political ideology of
                        the Soviet bloc threaten the national interests of free peoples provides an
                        increasingly realistic foundation for the development of free world
                        strength. Each effective increment to this <pb xml:id="pg_97" n="97"
                            facs="0127"/>strength adds to the morale and resolution of free peoples.
                        In particular, the development of closer cooperation and rearmament in
                        Western Europe and the association of Western Germany and Japan with the
                        free nations will progressively add to the free world’s strength and
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>17. The principles of free democratic government, the rights of individuals
                        and the opportunities for peoples to develop their own national and cultural
                        interests free of outside interference still have broad appeal. Insofar as
                        the governments of the free world are able to demonstrate that these
                        principles are being pursued and advanced, progress can continue to be made
                        toward enlisting popular support both within and without the Soviet
                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>18. More particularly, the free world’s political warfare capabilities
                        include the following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The free world still controls the vast bulk of the world’s economic
                            resources and productive capacity. By appropriate economic measures, the
                            U.S. and its allies can help to deprive the Soviet orbit of needed
                            resources and retard the development of Soviet orbit military potential.
                            By skillful execution of other measures against the Soviet orbit, the
                            United States and its allies may sap the morale of satellite leaders and
                            encourage rifts between the USSR and the satellite countries. It should
                            be recognized, however, that measures of these types alone, however
                            vigorously pursued against the Soviet orbit, cannot be counted on
                            drastically to reduce the threat which the Soviet system poses to the
                            free world.</item>
                        <item>b. In the countries outside the Soviet orbit the free world can weaken
                            Communist organizations and reduce the Communist potential for
                            revolution and sabotage.</item>

                    <p>19. Nevertheless, the free world is beset by grave problems, some of
                        which—quite independent of any Soviet action—reduce its strength and
                        resolution:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. It consists of independent nations and dependent areas with varying
                            interests and objectives. It consists of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies, among whom there are important divergent
                            interests; various pro-Western countries such as the Latin American
                            nations and the British Commonwealth countries which are associated in
                            varying degrees with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers;
                            and a large group of countries such as Burma, Indonesia, and the Arab
                            States which do not actively participate in the East-West conflict.
                            While basically elements of strength, these varying interests and
                            objectives make the free nations susceptible to communist divisive
                            pressures.</item>
                        <item>b. The economic and social conditions of large masses of people have
                            not improved enough to combat the appeal of communism.</item>
                        <item>c. The principal nations of the free world have been obliged, for one
                            reason or another, to work with unpopular and undemocratic governments.
                            This has caused dissention, resentment, and disillusionment <pb
                                xml:id="pg_98" n="98" facs="0128"/>in various quarters, and has thus
                            created opportunities for communist exploitation.</item>
                        <item>d. The lack of strong and dynamic governments weakens the ability of
                            numerous free countries to cope with social, economic and rearmament
                            problems and to act vigorously in the cold war. In continental Western
                            Europe, for example, the narrow parliamentary majorities and
                            fragmentation of political parties in such key countries as France,
                            Italy, and West Germany impairs the development of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strength. In the Near and Far East,
                            the inexperience of the present leadership, widespread corruption and
                            lack of a firm popular base hampers the ability of various countries to
                            strengthen themselves internally and to cope with Communist and
                            extremist pressures.</item>
                        <item>e. The rise of nationalism in important areas of Asia and Africa has
                            created many divisive conflicts. This nationalism is still largely
                            anti-Western. It represents a reaction against the former or remaining
                            colonial controls, and is aggravated by the reluctance of certain
                            colonial powers to face the problems created by the recent growth of
                            nationalist feeling.</item>
                        <item>f. Continuing economic weaknesses within even the principal non-Soviet
                            powers hamper the development of free world strength and provide
                            opportunities for Communist exploitation. Despite continued economic
                            expansion, largely with U.S. assistance, the Western countries are still
                            susceptible to economic crises resulting from unfavorable trade
                            patterns, the burdens of rearmament, and inadequate governmental fiscal
                            systems and anti-inflationary controls. In Asia and Africa economic
                            weakness results largely from the lack of development of national
                            resources, which has prevented local governments from satisfying rising
                            popular demands and achieving political stability and economic
                            viability.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>20. There are, moreover, varying degrees of resentment, fear and distrust of
                        the United States in many parts of the free world. In some quarters of
                        Western Europe there is still some fear that the United States will
                        recklessly precipitate a general war with the USSR or leave Western Europe
                        unprotected after provoking the USSR to take military action. There is also
                        popular resentment over certain U.S. trade policies and over U.S. pressure
                        for increased rearmament efforts. In many quarters through the Middle and
                        Far East there is a feeling that the United States has supported the
                        colonial powers, and in the Arab states there is resentment over U.S.
                        support of Israeli independence.</p>

                            Orbit</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>21. The economy of the Soviet orbit is being steadily expanded, including
                        long-term development of the orbit’s strategic potential. Particular
                        attention is apparently being given to capital construction, chiefly in the
                        heavy industries and in the electrical, transportation, and communications
                        fields. Under this program an estimated <pb xml:id="pg_99" n="99"
                            facs="0129"/>25% of the USSR’s gross national product is going into
                        capital investment. The USSR is thus increasing not only its actual
                        production but—more important—its basic industrial potential.</p>
                    <p>22. A high level of immediate war readiness is being maintained. In 1951
                        about 16% of the Soviet gross national product went to direct military
                        expenditures, and additional substantial sums, amounting to an estimated 7%
                        of the gross national product, were spent on research and development in
                        fields of military importance and on strategic stockpiling, post-enlistment
                        and pre-enlistment training, the maintenance of internal security troops,
                        and other activities directly contributing to the present Soviet war
                        potential.</p>
                    <p>23. The industrial economies of the European satellites are being expanded
                        and integrated with that of the USSR. They already contribute to the USSR
                        large, and in some cases critical, quantities of raw materials and
                        industrial goods, including uranium ore and concentrates, petroleum
                        products, industrial chemicals, and engineering equipment. The importance of
                        the contributions will increase as production programs develop and
                        Soviet-satellite integration progresses.</p>
                    <p>24. Many major Soviet plants are designed and equipped for rapid conversion
                        to war production, and strategic considerations appear to have an important
                        bearing on the location of new industrial installations. Because of this
                        emphasis on strategic considerations, in many cases accomplished at the
                        expense of consumer needs, and because of the rigorous control which the
                        Kremlin exercises over all important aspects of Soviet economic activity, a
                        comparison of Soviet and Western production figures is of only limited value
                        as a gauge of relative war potential.</p>
                    <p>25. In the event of early general war the Soviet economy could, in the
                        absence of destruction from Allied attack, support a substantial increase in
                        military production. The Soviet munitions industry has a sizable reserve
                        capacity, and many other industries could be quickly converted to serve
                        military needs. During the early phase of operations stringent controls over
                        the allocation of materials, transportation and labor could prevent the
                        development of critical deficiencies. In a prolonged war, however, certain
                        shortages probably would weaken or limit some phases of the Soviet military
                        effort. Successful allied air attack would, of course, greatly aggravate
                        these difficulties.</p>
                    <p>26. The Soviet orbit is largely self-sufficient in raw materials, and
                        dependence on outside sources in relation to total consumption of most
                        commodities is relatively small in peace-time. The chief commodities for
                        which the USSR is dependent on sources outside the Soviet orbit are rubber,
                        tin, wool, jute, and industrial diamonds. Economic deficiencies which are
                        expected to persist during <pb xml:id="pg_100" n="100" facs="0130"/>the next
                        few years include such items as certain types of aviation fuels, some
                        chemical items, electronics, merchant shipping, some types of machinery
                        equipment and precision instruments, certain nonferrous metals and
                        ferroalloys, and a wide variety of replacement parts and equipment
                        components. Agricultural production in the USSR and the European satellites
                        meets requirements for the comparatively low levels of consumption.</p>
                    <p>27. The Soviet bloc transportation system, in which railroads occupy by far
                        the most important position, represents a stringency in the peacetime
                        economy but in wartime it has the capacity, after cutbacks in non-essential
                        traffic, to meet military and major economic requirements in a major war.
                        This estimate assumes no damage from hostile attack. The difference in
                        gauges between the Soviet and satellite rail systems necessitates the
                        transloading of all freight to standard gauge at or near the borders of the
                        Soviet Union. Some 16 transfer zones, several of which are extensive in
                        nature, retard through freight movements, but their capacity is adequate to
                        handle Soviet logistic requirements. Despite the foregoing limitations, the
                        Soviet rail system is probably better equipped to support a major war effort
                        than it was in 1940.</p>
                    <p>28. The close balance between availability and requirements in many items of
                        importance to the Soviet Bloc economy, together with the vulnerability of
                        some important segments of the economy to air attack, would represent the
                        principal weakness in any effort to maintain or strengthen the economy of
                        the Soviet bloc under wartime conditions. The concentration of certain
                        industries in areas accessible to Allied bombers and the extreme difficulty
                        of replacing or reconstructing plants makes these industries highly
                        vulnerable. Attacks on these industries could produce a serious reduction in
                        the supply of vital services and commodities; however, substantial stocks of
                        these commodities and of military end items, which are widely dispersed,
                        would prevent the full effects of such losses from being felt at the front
                        during the early phases of the conflict.</p>

                    <p>30. This great strength and flexibility of the United States economy would,
                        however, be subjected to severe stresses under wartime conditions. The
                        United States would be the primary arsenal of the entire free world to an
                        even greater degree than was the case in World War II. The degree of shift
                        of resources from normal economic purposes to war-waging activities would be
                        much greater than the corresponding shift in Soviet orbit countries. The
                        U.S. economy is dependent upon outside sources for more vitally needed raw
                        materials than the Soviet and this condition would be accentuated during
                        war. The maintenance of control over producing areas, and the maintenance of
                        supply lines to these areas would place an added strain upon war-oriented
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>31. However, the United States and some other countries in the free world are
                        currently engaged in a mobilization program which is designed to facilitate
                        any future shift to a war economy and to maintain a substantial level of
                        strength over an extended period. Industrial capacity is being created,
                        susceptible of shifting to direct war support, which otherwise would have to
                        be built in the early stages of actual conflict. In most cases, under
                        present programs and schedules, this capacity will serve concurrently to
                        support a rising consumption level and a structure of weapons facilities and
                        a flow of actual weapons output, both in conventional armament and in
                        weapons of mass destruction. Sources of materials supply, both within the
                        continental United States and elsewhere in the free world, are being
                        steadily expanded, with exceptions in the case of certain important
                        materials. Actual stocks in the government-owned stockpile, though still
                        deficient in some materials, have increased steadily since mid-1950.</p>
                    <p>32. Elsewhere in the free world, efforts aimed at broadening and
                        strengthening the industrial base are proceeding much more slowly. The
                        United States has assisted this development in such fields as electric
                        power, transport of all kinds, steel capacity, non-ferrous metal production,
                        and agriculture. There has been a welcome inheritance in Western Europe from
                        four years of Marshall Plan cooperation. The net outflow of resources from
                        the U.S. economy <pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0132"/>is and will be
                        greater than that from the Soviet economy to its satellite areas; indeed,
                        the flow of assistance is to a considerable degree inward to the Russian
                        economy rather than outward.</p>
                    <p>33. The task of strengthening the U.S. economy against the contingency of war
                        is one which has been accepted and will be carried out by U.S. industry. To
                        accomplish the established goals of the armament program, a relatively
                        smaller diversion of resources away from consumption goods will be required
                        here than is necessary to achieve comparable goals in the Soviet orbit.</p>
                    <p>34. There is now evidence to support the view that projected U.S. armament
                        programs, including the program for industrial expansion, can be maintained
                        with less restriction on the civilian economy than was believed possible a
                        few months ago. One reason for this has been the steadily increasing
                        capacity of the American economy to produce civilian and military goods;
                        each year that passes will, by past experience, see further improvement in
                        that capacity. In addition, the pressure upon the civilian segment of the
                        economy has been less than was expected at the end of 1950 because military
                        requirements then stated have been subsequently modified by a stretch-out.
                        This situation could permit an acceleration in the production of certain
                        military end items over the schedules now contemplated; it holds out the
                        further possibility that the United States is capable of sustaining a
                        generally higher level of arms production than is contemplated by currently
                        projected programs.</p>
                    <p>35. But the maintenance for several years ahead of a complex program of (a)
                        increasing our present lead in weapons of mass destruction, (b) expanding
                        current output of conventional armament, (c) expanding and balancing the
                        war-supporting industrial base, and (d) assisting free world allies to
                        increase their own military and economic strength—all rest on the
                        willingness of the American public to sustain and support the resulting
                        burden. This burden may involve a willingness in the United States and
                        allied countries to accept an increased diversion of scarce materials and
                        other resources to armament production through more severe direct physical
                        controls. In addition more vigorous price and credit controls and a heavier
                        tax burden would be required in order to protect the economies of these
                        nations. The combined efforts of labor, capital and management must
                        contribute to the accomplishment of the task at hand, with each accepting a
                        comparable degree of sacrifice. The effort must stem from conviction of its
                        value.</p>
                    <p>36. Allocation of budgetary money costs to military purposes within the free
                        world presents a further difficulty. A relatively free price system is
                        sensitive to the threat and actuality of government deficits. In 1950–51,
                        the free world endured a punishing object <pb xml:id="pg_103" n="103"
                            facs="0133"/>lesson in the added money cost of military programs; the
                        threat of inflationary effects, even without budgetary deficits in any of
                        the leading free nations (e.g. U.S., U.K., Canada) set off a wave of
                        advancing prices. Planning the level of military build-up must therefore
                        include as a factor, and recognize as a limit, the effect of varying levels
                        of military expenditure upon tax burdens and inflationary pressures.</p>
                    <p>37. A comparison of relative production figures gives only an imperfect
                        picture of the war potential of the Soviet economy. Subject to this
                        qualification, however, the figures in the attached table represent the
                        situation with respect to several key items.</p>

                    <p>38. In terms of both available resources and productive capacity, the Soviet
                        bloc is in a position of marked inferiority vis-à-vis the free world;
                        moreover, although the Soviet position is still improving, in the
                        foreseeable future the orbit’s basic economic strength will not approach
                        equality with the free world. Moreover, the Soviet bloc would encounter
                        greater economic difficulty than the free world in expanding military
                        production from present levels, with or without war, partly because of the
                        low level of civilian consumption now existing in the USSR. Nevertheless,
                        the Soviet orbit, through its total control over the Soviet economy and
                        population, <pb xml:id="pg_104" n="104" facs="0134"/>can utilize a high
                        proportion of the Soviet orbit resources and potential to achieve and
                        maintain the present level of military preparedness. In the absence of
                        general war, it is far more difficult for the free world to achieve an
                        adequate utilization of its resources and potential to counter the Soviet
                        threat. The present Soviet advantage in available military equipment
                        (stockpiles), in current military production of certain items and in
                        preparedness for expansion of military production derives from the fact that
                        such production has continued at a high rate since 1945, and from the
                        Kremlin’s centralized control over the economy.</p>
                    <p>39. The increasingly destructive power that will be available to both sides
                        could make it more difficult to ensure the effective conversion of the
                        economies to full war production. In planning the utilization of its
                        resources in the absence of general war, therefore, the free world cannot
                        give the same weight as in previous wars to its heavy preponderance of
                        productive capacity and economic potential as the determining factor in
                        preventing or winning a general war.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>40. The Soviet orbit now has formidable military capabilities. The principal
                        elements of communist armed strength in being are the Soviet Army of about
                        2½ million men organized into about 175 divisions; the several Soviet Air
                        Forces of about 600, 000 men and 20, 000 aircraft; the Soviet Fleet of about
                        680, 000 men and 810, 000 tons of naval vessels, including 370 submarines of
                        which about 100 are long-range vessels. Available to complement these forces
                        in the cold war and to supplement them in the event of general war are the
                        Chinese and satellite armed forces, although their effectiveness is
                        conditioned by their combat-readiness and political reliability. While the
                        size of the Soviet forces is relatively stable, it appears that the Chinese
                        and satellite forces are in the process of being both expanded and
                        modernized as to equipment. The satellite armed forces now total over 1,
                        000, 000 men in about 70 divisions, with an estimated expansion to over 1½
                        million men in 120 divisions to be reached by late 1953. Satellite air
                        forces are being organized and equipped with modern Soviet planes. The
                        Chinese Communist army of over 3½ million men is the most powerful ground
                        force in the Far East. Its capabilities will probably increase with the
                        provision of Soviet equipment and higher standards of organization and
                        training under Soviet direction. The Chinese air force appears to be
                        expanding in size and is using modern Soviet aircraft.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_105" n="105" facs="0135"/>
                    <p>41. It is estimated that at the end of 1951 the USSR possessed a stockpile of
                        about 30 atomic weapons with an energy yield between 30 and 70 kilotons.
                        Current estimates indicate that the Soviet stockpile of atomic weapons will
                        increase approximately as follows: mid-1952, 50; mid-1953, 100; mid-1954,
                        190; mid-1955, 300. In view of the many uncertainties and variable factors
                        involved, the Soviet weapon stockpile at any given time may be half as large
                        or twice as large as the figures stated above. Despite its over-all economic
                        inferiority in comparison with the free world, the Soviet system has also
                        succeeded in developing significant electronic, and possibly <gloss
                            target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>42. Because of the advanced state of mobilization of the Soviet economy, and
                        because of raw material and equipment reserves which the Soviets probably
                        have accumulated, the Soviets would be able to support extensive military
                        operations of an offensive nature during the early phases of a general war.
                        However, the relatively smaller size of the Soviet industrial base, its
                        relative inflexibility and relative shortage of developed resources, would
                        render it less capable than the U.S. economy of sustaining a protracted
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>43. The air defenses of the USSR have improved substantially since 1945, and
                        an air offensive against the principal Soviet centers of population and
                        industry would encounter vigorous and determined opposition. Although
                        deficiencies in Soviet air defenses now exist, the Soviet air defense system
                        can be expected to make the cost of air attack increasingly high within the
                        next few years. While it is not possible accurately to estimate the
                        immediate effects of our air offensive against the USSR, it appears that we
                        will retain the capability of inflicting damage of such magnitude as to
                        reduce substantially the over-all Soviet potential through destruction of
                        military and economic targets.</p>
                    <p>44. The Soviet advantages in war derive from an abundance of manpower which
                        it can use with little regard to losses, large inventories of military
                        equipment with production lines in being, a highly effective world-wide
                        intelligence and subversive system, and sufficient area to permit absorption
                        of heavy military losses without decisive results. Soviet disadvantages
                        result from shortages of raw materials and industrial capacity—which would
                        be accentuated by hostile attack—and the problems involved in the retention
                        of Kremlin control over the armed forces and dissident elements. The
                        advantages which normally would accrue from interior lines of communication
                        would be offset to some extent by limited transportation networks over vast
                        areas.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Free World Capabilities</p>
                    <p>45. While the armed forces of the free world are significant in size, it
                        would be misleading in terms of capabilities to tabulate their totals. Their
                        far-flung geographic deployments, conflicting national interests, their
                        differences in training, organization, equipment, and will to fight, all
                        detract from the value of tabulating totals.</p>
                    <p>46. Bearing in mind the above reservations, it is nevertheless useful to
                        indicate briefly the extent to which the military forces of the United
                        States and its allies have been strengthened since mid-1950:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. There are more than twice as many men and women in the U.S. armed
                            services as there were in June 1950 (the increase is from about 1.7
                            million to about 3.6 million). There will be about 20 Army and three
                            Marine divisions in being in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. The
                            state of combat readiness is being steadily improved as a result of
                            training, experience, and the flow of modern equipment.</item>
                        <item>b. U.S. monthly production of military end items is five or six times
                            as large as it was in June 1950. Between July 1951 and May 1952 the
                            monthly deliveries of military end items have risen from an annual rate
                            of $6.4 billion to $17.8 billion, and the trend is sharply upward. In

                        genuinely effective forces which can be created. On balance, the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments, and such additional
                        declarations as those of the United States and its allies concerning Berlin,
                        together with European efforts and U.S. assistance, have made it clear that
                        military action in Europe by the USSR or its satellites would almost
                        certainly lead to general war. It is therefore unlikely that the Soviet
                        orbit will take military action there unless it is prepared to engage in
                        general war. If general war should occur, however, even with the
                        improvements which would result from achievement of the foregoing, it is not
                        expected that the free world will have the capability by mid-1953 of holding
                        more than lodgement areas in Europe against a determined Soviet assault, or
                        that Western Europe as a whole can be assured against Soviet occupation
                        prior to 1956.</p>
                    <p>48. Developments affecting the military position of the free world in the Far
                        and Middle East are more difficult to predict. In the Far East, this is due
                        in part to the uncertain situations in Korea and Southeast Asia.
                        Additionally, there are a number of political and economic problems
                        surrounding the question of Japanese rearmament, but the contribution which
                        Japan can make to the free world renders it imperative that the restoration
                        of Japan continue to be a major objective. For a strong and friendly Japan
                        would provide a natural anchor for Western defenses in the Pacific and would
                        make an immense contribution to the maintenance of the free world position
                        throughout Asia. In the Middle East, the primary threat appears to be
                        communist exploitation of political and economic instability, rather than
                        direct military intervention. Continued deterioration of conditions there
                        could result in the loss to the West of strategic positions and resources.
                        Under a continuation of present programs, priorities and force dispositions,
                        it does not appear that free world military capabilities in the Far East and
                        Middle East will significantly improve.</p>

                    <p>49. Free world advantages derive from its ability to project its strength
                        outward to the enemy; its atomic capability; a three or four to one
                        superiority in industrial capacity; and a vast area many principal parts of
                        which would not be vulnerable to attack by massed manpower. Offsetting these
                        advantages are the normal conflicts of interest among sovereign nations;
                        unwillingness or inability to assume commitments which would produce
                        additional strains on limited resources; and the tendency of free peoples to
                        avoid sacrifice until they realize that the danger facing them is of such
                        magnitude that it can no longer be ignored.</p>

                    <p>50. Through ruthless exploitation and domination, the USSR since 1945 has
                        created a system of satellite states with military forces with which we must
                        reckon. We now credit the satellites, aided logistically by the USSR, with
                        the capability of defeating Yugoslavia if not assisted by the West, although
                        Yugoslavia prior to leaving the Soviet orbit was the strongest military
                        force in the Balkans. The Chinese People’s Republic, in control of the
                        Chinese land mass and apparently responsive to Soviet influence, has
                        stalemated the situation in Korea and appears to have the capability of
                        overrunning mainland Southeast Asia against the pro-Western forces presently
                        in the area. Thus there are available for communist aggression, under the
                        direction of the Soviet Union but without direct Soviet involvement,
                        military forces adequate to achieve local superiority in important areas
                        unless the free world intervenes.</p>
                    <p>51. The free world’s response to local aggression is handicapped by a number
                        of factors. First among these is preoccupation with the threat of global
                        war. The fear of our allies is that the over-all strength of the United
                        States is not sufficient to insure that action can be taken to counter local
                        aggression without serious risk of general war. From this stems the fear of
                        attrition and dispersion of resources (while the Soviet Union is able to
                        retain the concentration of its military forces) and the doubtful
                        willingness and ability of the European democracies to devote sufficient of
                        their national resources to distant areas while their homelands remain
                        vulnerable to direct Soviet attack. There is also the apathy of the
                        threatened areas toward communism, which, when coupled with xenophobia and
                        nationalist aspirations, hampers the ability of the Western powers to defend
                        these areas.</p>
                    <p>52. Notwithstanding these inherent difficulties, the free world is not
                        incapable of responding effectively to local military challenges. Moreover,
                        its over-all rearmament effort is re-enforcing existing deterrents to those
                        aggressive acts which would be likely to lead, in the opinion of the Soviet,
                        to general war. Europe is being made safer from direct ground assault and
                        the United States is significantly <pb xml:id="pg_109" n="109" facs="0139"
                        />increasing its armed forces and its readiness for war. One result of the
                        United Nations action in Korea has been to create uncertainty in the minds
                        of the Soviet leaders regarding future Western reaction. The sum of these
                        developments has the result of significantly narrowing the opportunities
                        open to the Soviets for aggression by proxy without serious risk of general
                        war. However, there is still a serious threat of communist expansion into
                        Southeast Asia and a more indirect communist threat to the Middle East.
                        Despite the vital interest of the free world in assuring that these areas do
                        not fall behind the Iron Curtain, measures to deal with a sudden worsening
                        of situations in the Far and Middle East are not now provided for under
                        present programs, priorities and force levels. In the circumstances, the
                        questions arise (a) whether these serious threats can be met by a
                        re-distribution of the free world’s effort presently programmed, or (b)
                        whether consideration must be given to increasing the total effort, or (c)
                        both. It is evident that a revision of existing priorities would be
                        accomplished at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        area. It is to be noted in this regard that the analysis in Part I of this
                        paper views a deliberate Soviet attack on Europe (made in the full knowledge
                        that such an act would bring the North Atlantic Treaty into operation) as
                        very unlikely, unless the Soviets believed themselves capable of dealing the
                        United States a “decisive” blow or of so reducing the power potential of the
                        United States as to render it permanently incapable of effectively
                        challenging Soviet power. It is the conclusion of a subsequent section of
                        this analysis that the Soviets do not now possess such a capability. From
                        the foregoing it may be argued that the relative improvement of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defenses, including the organization of
                            <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and the promise of greater
                        forces over the next two years, would increasingly permit a shift of
                        emphasis to other areas. On the other hand, notwithstanding the heavy
                        concentration of the military effort in Europe and the fact that
                        considerable progress has been made, achievement of the tentatively planned
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> armament goals is by no means
                        assured. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is now aiming to achieve a
                        balanced 25–50 division force (exclusive of Greek and Turkish forces) by the
                        end of calendar 1952, with all force levels beyond that date provisional and
                        subject to annual review. The prospect is, therefore, that continued
                        progress even toward <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force levels
                        below those regarded as militarily desirable will require continued
                        application of effort on that area.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>53. At present the Soviet system has the military capability of overrunning
                        large portions of continental Europe, the Near East, and Southeast Asia
                        before the free world could mobilize and bring to bear forces adequate to
                        halt the Soviet drive. Powerful blows <pb xml:id="pg_110" n="110"
                            facs="0140"/>could be struck by Soviet air and submarine forces against
                        the U.K. and Japan, perhaps sufficient together with <gloss target="#t_BW1"
                            >BW</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>, and sabotage operations,
                        seriously to reduce the usefulness of these positions as bases. The Soviet
                        system does not now have adequate naval forces and sufficient shipping to
                        enable it to make large overseas amphibious type attacks. The USSR does not
                        now appear capable of occupying the U.K. The air forces of the Soviet system
                        are now capable of providing adequate tactical support to the ground forces.
                        U.S. bases overseas could be brought under attack with atomic and other
                        weapons. The Soviet long-range air force is capable of atomic attack on the
                        United States and might achieve surprise in the initial strike. Sabotage and
                        overt and clandestine <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> attacks could be employed against a variety
                        of targets, including important military, industrial, and governmental
                        targets in the United States.</p>
                    <p>54. The most promising development in the defense of Western Europe is the
                        prospect of integrating the resources of Western Germany into the European
                        Defense Community. If the political and economic obstacles can be
                        surmounted, and if the output of equipment can be sufficiently expanded to
                        provide arms for the forces that will be available, a significant change in
                        over-all capabilities may take place in a few years. Further, the
                        availability of tactical atomic weapons in the near future will add greatly
                        to the Western defensive potential. The equipping and training of the
                        Japanese Police Reserve will provide an additional ten divisions by 1954 for
                        the defense of Japan, which will improve the prospect of successfully
                        implementing Western strategy in the Far East. Under presently projected
                        programs, it is unlikely that the Free World will be able during the next
                        several years to do more in the Middle East than provide the forces required
                        to hold certain vital areas in the face of Soviet assault.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>55. The capabilities of the United States and USSR in the field of weapons of
                        mass destruction are considered primarily in the context of general war.
                        However, it is recognized that the possession of stockpiles of these weapons
                        by both sides will have an increasing impact on the tactics employed in the
                        cold war and that appropriate atomic weapons may be employed by either side
                        for limited purposes. It should also be borne in mind that atomic and
                        possible thermonuclear capabilities must be considered in their relationship
                        to conventional military capabilities, since the two are inter-dependent and
                        mutually re-enforcing. Superiority in one sphere does not completely offset
                        deficiency in the other.</p>
                    <p>56. The unknown factor in all calculations of relative capabilities is the
                        effect atomic warfare may have on both sides. The possibility <pb
                            xml:id="pg_111" n="111" facs="0141"/>that either or both sides may,
                        during the next two to five years, develop and have available for use
                        thermonuclear weapons many times more powerful than atomic bombs accentuates
                        the difficulties of attempting to assess future situations.</p>
                    <p>57. It is the developing atomic capability of the USSR and the probable
                        advent of the thermonuclear weapons, together with the bipolarization of
                        power and the imbalance of conventional armaments, which significantly
                        change the security position of the United States and require a searching
                        re-examination of current policies and programs. These developments render
                        the United States vulnerable to direct attack of serious proportions.</p>
                    <p>58. The new security problem lies in the great power of atomic and
                        thermonuclear weapons and the possibility that the USSR and the United
                        States may each achieve a capability sufficient to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Seriously cripple for many months the ability of the other to
                            mobilize and carry on an organized war effort.</item>
                        <item>b. Place the ultimate victory of the other in grave doubt.</item>
                        <item>c. Render both sides through exchange of atomic and possible
                            thermonuclear blows incapable of achieving a clear-cut decision.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>By steady production and accumulation, both sides must be presumed to be
                        advancing toward the day when they will possess the capability to achieve
                        one of the above results; and the prospect is that neither side will be
                        able, short of war, to arrest the progress of the other toward such atomic
                        and possible thermonuclear strength.</p>
                    <p>59. The United States is increasing its atomic strength and may soon develop
                        a thermonuclear weapon. There is, in fact, every indication that its present
                        advantage in atomic weapons stockpile and in the production of fissionable
                        materials will be further increased; and means for their delivery exist. The
                        free world will thus continue to have a significant advantage in the event
                        of war, but it does not appear to be conclusive that the possession of a
                        superior atomic and possible thermonuclear capability can of itself provide
                        assurance against deliberate initiation of general war. This is so because
                        the controlling relationship in the atomic equation appears not to be that
                        of stockpiles to each other, but rather the relationship of one stockpile,
                        plus its deliverability, to the number of key enemy targets, including
                        retaliatory facilities, which must be destroyed in order to warrant an
                        attack. If this latter relationship is controlling, then it follows that the
                        Soviets may achieve what is, in their judgment, a level of atomic strength
                        sufficient to warrant the risk of an all-out surprise attack, even though
                        this level be inferior—in absolute terms—to the then-existing atomic
                        strength of the United States.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_112" n="112" facs="0142"/>
                    <p>60. There are several means open to the free world for increasing the
                        difficulties and dangers of an attack which the Soviets might contemplate,
                        and thus for extending for the foreseeable future those conditions which
                        will not be favorable to a general Soviet attack. For the present, it apears
                        that the USSR does not have the means to deliver a decisive attack upon the
                        free world. However, Soviet atomic capabilities will presumably continue to
                        grow. While increased defensive countermeasures can serve to postpone the
                        attainment of a Soviet capability which the Soviet leaders might regard as
                        sufficiently devastating to warrant an attack, it does not appear that
                        measures which are feasible for the free world to take can prevent the
                        probable attainment of a Soviet capability to damage critically the United
                        States. Two factors underline this conclusion: (a) the increasing cost of
                        effective defense and (b) the limitations on the development and maintenance
                        of defensive measures which free society can impose upon itself without
                        losing a substantial degree of the freedoms now enjoyed. The free world for
                        its own protection must take measures to improve active and passive defense,
                        including the exploration of new technological possibilities, but
                        nevertheless must probably accept a substantial degree of vulnerability and
                        avoid disproportionate concentration of resources on defense at the expense
                        of measures necessary to project its strength outward to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>61. On the other hand, the free world’s continued possession of a superior
                        atomic capability should constitute a powerful deterrent. For in the event
                        of war, the Soviets would understand that, unless they could derive decisive
                        results from the initial attack, in the ensuing series of atomic strikes and
                        counter-strikes the advantage would lie with the side having the larger
                        stockpile and the greater and more flexible means of delivery. In the event
                        of war under such conditions, the Soviets would face the probability that
                        the free world would retain the capacity to carry out atomic attacks after
                        the Soviet stockpile was exhausted. Such considerations would probably
                        re-enforce Soviet reluctance to initiate general war.</p>
                    <p>62. In light of the reluctance of the Soviets to expose their power center to
                        direct attack, it is basic that we maintain the capacity to deliver an
                        atomic offensive of adequate power under all foreseeable conditions, i.e.,
                        despite sabotage, enemy attack, or adverse political developments in
                        overseas areas where U.S. forces are based. Provided that the necessary
                        effort is made to assure their continuing validity, three factors may be
                        cited in support of the view that we can maintain such a capacity: (1) the
                        free world’s substantial atomic superiority and the high probability that
                        the margin of this superiority will increase; (2) the development of
                        well-dispersed overseas bases close to the sources of Soviet political and
                        industrial <pb xml:id="pg_113" n="113" facs="0143"/>power; and (3) the
                        increasing variety of mass destruction weapons and of the methods of their
                        delivery. In combination these factors support the view that the United
                        States and its allies hold it within their power to develop and maintain a
                        position of strength, flexibility and depth adequate to deter the Soviets
                        from deliberately initiating general war and to discourage them from
                        pursuing courses of action involving grave risk of general war.</p>
                    <p>63. The concurrent development of two atomic and possible thermonuclear
                        capabilities will steadily increase, for both sides, the adverse
                        consequences of general war. It must however be expected that the value of
                        the free world’s atomic and possible thermonuclear strength, while it will
                        remain high as a deterrent to general war, may diminish as a deterrent to
                        local Soviet-inspired aggression. For in the face of the increasingly grave
                        implications of general war, democratic governments may experience
                        difficulty in facing up squarely to a Soviet challenge to an area distant
                        from the homeland; whereas the Kremlin can probably take greater risks. The
                        prospect must accordingly be faced that, with the accumulation on both sides
                        of atomic and other mass destruction weapons, the developing situation may
                        present a continuing and possibly improved opportunity for Soviet expansion
                        by the techniques of political warfare and local aggression, if the free
                        world permits the fear and threat of general war to paralyze its reaction to
                        such threats.</p>
                    <p>64. Nevertheless it is also possible that U.S. possession of atomic weapons,
                        particularly tactical types, will operate as a deterrent to local aggression
                        by providing an effective means of defeating it without resort to general
                        war.</p>

                    <p>1. This memorandum is in response to your memorandum, subject as above, dated
                        19 August 1952,<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">Not found in Department of State

                        with respect to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1, a draft statement
                        of policy by the National Security Council Staff on the above subject.</p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are generally in accord with the proposed policy
                        on Reappraisal of U.S. Objectives and Strategy for National Security as set
                        forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1. In view of the present
                        and prospective Soviet threats to U.S. security, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        feel that the timing of the military buildup is of the greatest importance
                        and that it should be expedited to the extent feasible in the light of other
                        compelling considerations.</p>
                    <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not unmindful of the importance of timely
                        use of military forces in support of national policies and in order to check
                        the cumulative losses to the free world of areas of great importance to our
                        national security. They consider, however, that in order to avoid
                        maldeployment with respect to readiness for general war a decision as to the
                        use of military forces should be made only after careful consideration of
                        conditions existing at the time.</p>

                    <p>1. The Policy Statement (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1) and its
                        supporting documents, when viewed in the light of the status of our national
                        security programs (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135), fail to supply
                        the Resources Board with an adequate framework for the evaluation of the
                        several programs relating to the nonmilitary security of the United States
                        regarding which it advises the President. Programs for passive defense
                        including civil defense, dispersal of industry, rehabilitation of industry
                        after attack, and the continuity of the essential functions of Government,
                        all have been proceeding with inadequate policy guidance.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_115" n="115" facs="0145"/>
                    <p>2. The policy needed is one which will relate the military defense and the
                        passive defense of the U.S. to each other and which also will relate our
                        over-all defenses to the estimated capabilities of the Soviets to attack the
                        U.S. There has been a lack, not corrected by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135 series, of guidance which would coordinate the nation’s
                        passive defense capabilities and its military defense capabilities.</p>
                    <p>3. As the agencies responsible for nonmilitary defense have developed their
                        programs a basic fact has become increasingly clear. There is very little
                        likelihood that these programs can be made effective, unless through
                        military defenses the destruction from enemy attack can be held down to
                        manageable proportions. This means that the two major elements of the
                        nation’s defense structure do not meet. The gap leaves us dangerously
                        vulnerable to the effects of attack.</p>
                    <p>4. Without effective military defense, passive measures which would
                        significantly reduce the damage resulting from attack are infeasible both
                        from the point of view of cost and time required to make them effective. It
                        is essential to formulate nonmilitary security programs in terms of their
                        relationship to military defensive capabilities. Similarly, military defense
                        must be programmed in light of the recognized limits of passive defenses to
                        deal with attack.</p>
                    <p>5. The assessment of our position with respect to the USSR, forming the
                        background for this paper and the goals of our programs which are based on
                        the findings of the paper, do not indicate that we now have or that we are
                        projecting military defenses for the United States adequate to deal with
                        Soviet offensive capabilities in the sense above outlined.</p>
                    <p>6. Paragraph 6c of the Policy Statement recommends that the United States
                        take the necessary measures to “assure ready defensive strength adequate to
                        provide in the event of general war a reasonable initial defense and to
                        ensure reasonable protection to the nation during the period of mobilization
                        for ultimate victory.”</p>
                    <p>7. One of the underlying assumptions of the paper is that in event of war the
                        enemy would endeavor to strike the United States with an initial decisive
                        blow. This can mean only that the initial blow would carry the full force of
                        the enemy’s capabilities for strategic attack. No evidence is found
                        indicating that we now possess or that our programs project defenses,
                        military and passive, capable of holding the results of such an enemy attack
                        within manageable proportions.</p>
                    <p>8. The paper also recommends in paragraph 6d that we round out and maintain
                        the mobilization base. The importance of protecting the mobilization base
                        against covert attack and sabotage is <pb xml:id="pg_116" n="116"
                            facs="0146"/>stressed. However, the necessity to provide military
                        defenses for the base against overt strategic attack is not dealt with.</p>
                    <p>9. Paragraph 7 states that the United States should develop substantially
                        improved civil defense in light of the capacity of the U.S.S.R. to deliver
                        an atomic or thermo-nuclear attack. This recommendation is made without
                        evaluation of the feasibility of providing adequate civil defense in the
                        presence of inadequate military defense.</p>
                    <p>10. In raising the problem of guiding nonmilitary security programs, two
                        broader problems are brought into question. They are the over-all adequacies
                        of our defense effort and the balance of that effort as between offensive
                        and defensive capabilities. The Summary and General Conclusions strongly
                        recommend that we not adopt a policy of strengthening our defenses at the
                        expense of projecting our strength outward to the enemy. This recommendation
                        has this Agency’s full support. Nevertheless, it is clear that we also must
                        deal realistically with the problem of insuring the people and the economic
                        power of the U.S. against destruction.</p>
                    <p>11. Underlying the nation’s defense policies and programs is the assumption
                        that the free world can create sufficient strength to deter the Soviets from
                        precipitating general war. The present major deterrent is our estimated
                        atomic superiority. Certainly another powerful deterrent would be defenses
                        adequate to make the enemy doubt his ability to gravely cripple the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>12. The staff study which underlies the Policy Statement points out with
                        great force that the deterrent effect of our atomic strength is likely to
                        decline over the next few years. This is due to the fact that “the control
                        relationship in the atomic equation appears not to be that of stockpiles to
                        each other, but rather the relationship of one stockpile, plus its
                        deliverability, to the number of key enemy targets, including retaliatory
                        facilities, which must be destroyed in order to warrant an attack.”</p>
                    <p>13. The decline in the deterrent force of our atomic strength underlines the
                        need for strengthening other deterrents, including the ability to blunt the
                        enemy’s attack. This, in turn, implies the need for a substantial over-all
                        increase in the national defense effort.</p>
                    <p>14. The failure of the policy paper to deal adequately with the foregoing
                        problems appears to result from an incomplete evaluation of the following
                        points:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. It is assumed that the Soviets would attack if they felt capable of
                            dealing the U.S. a decisive initial blow without gravely endangering
                            their own regime. (See appendix, para. 1)</item>
                        <item>b. Gross superiority of U.S. atomic striking power probably would not
                            deter the Soviets if they felt capable of striking such an initial <pb
                                xml:id="pg_117" n="117" facs="0147"/>decisive blow and, hence,
                            atomic superiority in itself soon will cease to be a controlling
                            deterrent to general war.</item>
                        <item>c. Nuclear weapons have made it possible for the initial attack to be
                            decisive and have greatly enhanced the value of surprise.</item>
                        <item>d. Since by means short of initiating general war the U.S. cannot
                            prevent the Soviets from building increasing strength for the delivery
                            of a mass-destruction attack, our immediate course must be to offset
                            that increasing strength so clearly as to leave little doubt in the
                            Soviet mind regarding its incapability to strike a decisive blow.</item>
                        <item>e. The growing Soviet strength can be offset by building defenses that
                            would place the success of an attempted decisive attack in serious doubt
                            and by building a retaliatory striking force clearly capable of
                            penetrating Soviet defenses to strike a blow that would both critically
                            damage the war making capacity of the USSR and gravely threaten the
                            continued existence of the regime.</item>
                        <item>f. The security of the U.S. can be safeguarded against the danger of
                            surprise decisive attack only by a major national effort to create the
                                <hi rend="italic">two</hi> foregoing deterrents to Soviet aggression
                            at the earliest possible date and under no circumstances at a date later
                            than the Soviet atomic stockpile reaches the level required for decisive
                            attack in terms of numbers of bombs vs number of U.S. and other free
                            world targets.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>15. For the above reasons it is not our view that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135 series provides adequate guidance in these respects for
                        our national security programs or for the formulation of the F.Y. 1954
                        Federal Budget. It is our recommendation that the problems before the nation
                        and our defense policies and programs be re-evaluated in light of the
                        foregoing considerations.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President stated that consideration of the reappraisal of programs for
                        national security was the order of business for the day’s meeting.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> had noted that there
                        were two reports—one on the status of the programs as of June 30, 1952, and
                        another on reappraisal of United States objectives and strategy—and had
                        explained their background and interrelationship, the President asked if
                        there were any comments on the status report.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> replied that
                        the first reaction he had to the Council’s consideration of the report was
                        that he was scared to death to have so many copies of so vital a document
                        around. He said that he would send back his own copies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> then explained that the
                        distribution of the status report had been limited as far as possible in
                        agreement with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> agencies, and that in
                        most instances certain pages had been deleted from copies distributed to
                        other than Council agencies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> strongly
                        supported the anxieties of the Secretary of State, and explained that his
                        security people were very worried about certain portions of the report. He
                        therefore wanted to turn all copies back to the Executive Secretary after
                        the Council had finished its consideration of the report.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he was glad to return his own copy, and directed
                        that all other copies should also be turned in to the Executive
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked if there were any further comments on the report.
                        There were none.</p>

                    <p>The President turned to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 and first
                        requested the comments of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1"
                            >Acheson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> stated that his
                        comments fell into three categories: First, the substance of what the report
                        recommended; secondly, omissions in the report; and thirdly, the language of
                        the report in general. As for the first category, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> said that he believed that in
                        general <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 constituted a
                        reaffirmation of the recommendations previously laid down in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20, 68 and 114 series. He then proceeded to
                        summarize these various recommendations of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1, suggesting that the heart of the paper was in
                        paragraph 9–a, which suggested a re-examination of the various programs
                        which had been set in motion by the three series in question. In general,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> thought that
                        the heart of the present report was sound, but that there were certain
                        difficulties and problems with respect to drafting and wording. The most
                        notable omission, in his view, was on United States economic and trade
                        policy in general, as opposed to policies regarding specific aid to our
                        allies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> noted
                        that the Department of State and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName>’s office were already engaged in studies of this
                        problem, and that it was a matter of the utmost importance.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the recommendations in paragraph 9–a, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> expressed the opinion that the
                        three departments most closely concerned—namely, State, Defense, and Mutual
                        Security— should, in consultation with other agencies, jointly create
                        working groups to consider the re-examination called for in paragraph 9–a,
                        and to come up subsequently with recommendations on the subjects. In
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>’s opinion this
                        task could be accomplished in not more than five or six weeks if the three
                        agencies in question could feel free to call upon the other member agencies
                        for assistance. He was certain, he added, that the results of such
                        reexamination would be of very great use in consideration of the budget for
                        Fiscal 1954.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> then enlarged
                        on what he regarded as the most serious omission in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1, namely, the absence of any <pb xml:id="pg_120"
                            n="120" facs="0150"/>treatment of general United States commercial and
                        economic policy. He did not feel, however, that it was possible to rectify
                        this omission in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1, and suggested
                        that instead the subject of economic and trade policy, which was now being
                        intensively studied in the State Department and in the Mutual Security
                        Agency and doubtless elsewhere in the Government, should be the subject of a
                        special and separate report which would outline the facts and possibly
                        provide recommendations for the benefit of the new Administration. In any
                        case, he added, the problem was one of general long-range policy, and <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 should do no more than call attention
                        to the existence of these separate studies.</p>
                    <p>The President then called upon Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1"
                            >Lovett</persName> for his comments on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> expressed
                        agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>
                        that the general conclusions of the paper were probably useful. It had
                        nevertheless caused considerable concern in the Department of Defense,
                        especially among the three Secretaries, because of the choice of certain
                        kinds of language. As an example he cited paragraph 1, which he felt was too
                        belligerent in tone and made no reference to our national aim to secure a
                        lasting peace. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>
                        even thought that it would be possible to see in this paragraph the
                        connotation of preventive war.</p>
                    <p>As a second instance of defects in drafting, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> pointed to the wording of
                        paragraph 9–b, on pages 7 and 8, particularly the last sentence. He said it
                        seemed to him to be a very awkward way of stating a truism, and that
                        naturally United States forces should not be committed to combat local
                        aggression if they did not expect a favorable decision. This sentence, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>, as presently
                        written was “absurd”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> also took
                        exception to the manner in which paragraph 15, on page 11, had been phrased.
                        The net of the Department of Defense’s feeling, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>, was that the purpose of the
                        report was good but that there was considerable room for improvement in the
                        drafting, and he felt that this latter problem should be referred to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> then turned his
                        attention to the suggestions which had been set forth by the Chairman of the
                        National Security Resources Board in his memorandum to the Council.<note
                            n="6" xml:id="d21fn6">
                            <ref target="#d20">

                            </ref>.</note> While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1"
                            >Lovett</persName> expressed sympathy for the lack of guidance which
                            <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> and the other civilian agencies so
                        keenly felt, he said that the type of information and guidance which were
                        requested in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName>’s
                        memorandum were for the most part not susceptible to any satisfactory
                        answer. There was no way at present of being sure <pb xml:id="pg_121"
                            n="121" facs="0151"/>that it would be possible to give even an hour’s
                        warning before an actual attack, nor was it yet possible to estimate exactly
                        what proportion of the attacking aircraft would get through to the target.
                        Thus far we were pretty well compelled to calculate this latter problem on
                        the basis of World War II experience, which indicated that 75% of an armed
                        enemy attack would get through. All this, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>, led up to the crucial question
                        of how much money was needed to create something like an absolute defense of
                        the nation’s critical target areas. There was no answer to that question
                        either, argued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>,
                        although one could at least say that it would be of a crushing size.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he had been startled by the briefing on this very
                        problem which he had been given that morning in the Cabinet Room. As far as
                        he could see, said the President, there wasn’t very much of a defense in
                        prospect except a vigorous offense.</p>
                    <p>On this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>
                        said that he felt that the rate of development of the nation’s offensive
                        capacity should be accelerated, but nevertheless he was forced to the
                        conclusion that notwithstanding the best efforts of all the agencies
                        concerned, military and civilian, it was impossible to achieve an accurate
                        foundation and basis on which Civil Defense and other agencies concerned
                        with passive defense could operate with maximum efficiency. It was, in
                        short, impossible to respond to the problem raised by <gloss
                            target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>. The defensive weapon of today was almost
                        always an offensive weapon also.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> then inquired whether
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> felt that the
                        Government had really exhausted all its capacities to meet the problem of
                        defense which he had raised and described in his memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> replied in the
                        negative, but insisted that progress was nevertheless slow and
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> then said that it was
                        his conviction that consideration ought to be given now to an extensive new
                        national effort to solve this problem, for which purpose the very best
                        brains available should be requisitioned for a period of anywhere from two
                        to ten years. At the present time, he added, there seemed to him relatively
                        little purpose and point in the formulation of programs of passive defense
                        which were foredoomed to failure in the event that the Soviets attack. In
                        such a case at present there would be no cities left to defend.</p>
                    <p>In response, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>
                        said that the Defense Department had for the past two years been making use
                        of the nation’s best scientists in an effort to deal with the defense
                        problem. In connection with his point, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> invited the Council’s attention
                        to <pb xml:id="pg_122" n="122" facs="0152"/>the Alsop column in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> calling for two large “Manhattan
                        District” projects. The conclusions which the column reached were, in
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>’s view, “utter
                        nonsense”, and in any case Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1"
                            >Lovett</persName> expressed the opinion that any such large project as
                        that which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> advocated
                        should not be permitted to complicate the revision of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> observed that
                        nevertheless some method should be worked out to enable the civilian and
                        military agencies to work together to better purpose on this problem and to
                        provide the military guidance necessary to the civilian agencies if they
                        were to do an effective job.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> still doubted
                        whether this belonged in any revision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        135/1, and went on to say that he felt that the nation was in much greater
                        danger from covert attack than it was from overt Soviet attack. What
                        troubled him particularly was “bombs in suitcases”.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> for his opinion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> replied that he found himself in general agreement
                        with the views of the Secretary of State and more particularly with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>’s proposal for
                        carrying out the reexamination of the programs recommended in paragraph
                        9–a.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that the Departments of State and Defense and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1">Harriman</persName>’s office should
                        get together and work out something on this problem in the near future.</p>
                    <p>In response to a request for his views, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_FOLEYEHJ1">Foley</persName> said that he was extremely
                        pleased with the prospect of a study of economic and fiscal policy going
                        along concurrently with other studies by State, Defense and <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WADSWORTHJJ1">Wadsworth</persName> then asked for
                        permission to give his views, which he stated were in large measure
                        identical with those set forth in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1"
                            >Gorrie</persName>’s memorandum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WADSWORTHJJ1"
                            >Wadsworth</persName> was, he said, especially struck by the imbalance
                        between our national security programs, particularly the heavy weighting on
                        the military as opposed to the civilian side. It was his opinion that the
                        revised report should call attention to this imbalance and advise its
                        correction. This could be rectified in the rewriting of the paper without
                        actually involving any major change in policy. Civil defense, he thought,
                        was rather neglected in the paper as compared to the heavy military
                        emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STAATSEB1">Staats</persName> inquired whether the
                        re-examination called for in paragraph 9–a would have the effect of holding
                        up the processing of the Fiscal Year 1954 budget, and was assured that it
                        would not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> then observed that the
                        Senior <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff had recommended deletion of
                        the last sentence of paragraph 9–a. As he understood <pb xml:id="pg_123"
                            n="123" facs="0153"/>it, he said, the re-examination called for in this
                        paragraph would now be accomplished by State, Defense and Mutual
                        Security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested,
                        however, that the revised paper include in it a statement to the effect that
                        a re-examination of this country’s general financial and economic policy was
                        being undertaken by the appropriate Government agencies as a separate
                        study.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>At the Council meeting this afternoon, the President directed the approval of
                        the recommendations in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 and the
                        creation of an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> group composed of State,

                        recommended in Paragraph 9(a) of the paper. The paper itself was referred
                        back to the Senior Staff for certain editorial changes and for an addition
                        referred to below.</p>
                    <p>I left with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> copies of the proposed
                        directive which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> will go
                        over and issue in due course if upon study Mr. <persName

                            corresp="#p_NOYESCP1">Noyes</persName> finds no objection to the
                        wording. I informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1">Harriman</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>In regard to substance, the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> view put
                        forward by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> and
                        answered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> resulted
                        in no action. <note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">The answer by <persName
                                corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> under reference cannot be
                            further identified. For the views of Chairman <persName

                                114</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1"
                            >Gorrie</persName> became satisfied that everything was being done which
                        could reasonably be expected along the lines of his request. Some of the
                        matters to which Defense will direct the attention of the Senior Staff, as
                        mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName>, were as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 1—Reference to the fundamental purpose, as stated in 68, and the
                        three specifications (a), (b) and (c) were criticized because they ought to
                        indicate that a primary objective of U.S. policy was the maintenance of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>The next passage mentioned was the last paragraph of 9(b). Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> pointed out that the object of
                        the draftsman was commendable but the statement as written seemed somewhat
                        absurd. The last paragraph mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1"
                            >Lovett</persName> was Paragraph 15, which to him carried the
                        connotation that we regretted the inability to fix the date for the opening
                        of the preventive war. Defense may have other suggestions also.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WADSWORTHJJ1">Wadsworth</persName>, representing
                        Civilian Defense, said that he would submit to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> some editorial changes in Paragraph
                        7 which were designed to protect the Civil Defense Administration from the
                        erroneous belief which might be held by the Budget Bureau that their request
                        for funds should be cut even lower than at present. It was agreed that such
                        changes would be made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1">Harriman</persName> requested that a
                        paragraph be inserted somewhere to indicate that questions of economic
                        policy were both <pb xml:id="pg_125" n="125" facs="0155"/>pressing and
                        intimately related to security matters and that work on these questions was
                        going forward both in the State Department and in <gloss target="#t_DMS1"
                            >DMS</gloss>, and that together and with the help of other agencies of
                        the Government a paper or series of papers would be prepared outside of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> so that the importance of this
                        matter and the ideas of the various agencies would be available at the
                        outset of the new Administration. The President approved of this effort and
                        also approved of the idea that it might be wiser not to attempt to work out
                        a complete governmental recommendation for the next Administration, but a
                        series of papers which would enable the new Administration to go forward
                        with its own program in this respect in the light of the necessities of
                        strengthening the free world through a wise economic policy in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>It developed that some fifty or more copies of the large volume of annexes
                        had been distributed. The President requested that all copies be returned to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName>, who would reissue them on
                        a “need to know” basis to the agencies particularly concerned with future
                        work ordered.</p>

                            >Gorrie</persName>, involve substance, may not be known until the Senior
                        Staff reconvenes Tuesday, September 9. In the case of Defense, I am informed
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> has before him a
                        great many written <pb xml:id="pg_126" n="126" facs="0156"/>comments,
                        including some rather biting ones from Messrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FINLETTERTK1">Finletter</persName> and Pace who for
                        different reasons object to the main implications of the Policy Statement.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FINLETTERTK1">Finletter</persName>, of course,
                        does not like perimeter actions while Mr. Pace wants to build up immediately
                        along the Elbe regardless of the outcome of the reexamination.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it may be that substantive proposals will be made to the Senior Staff
                        which will have to be brought back for examination in the Department; and
                        even if a formal meeting of the Council is not necessary, at least the
                        approval of each member through his respective agency’s channels may have to
                        be sought before the paper is circulated with the President’s approval.</p>

                        preparation of materials necessary for a re-examination of the amounts and
                        allocations of resources to various areas in terms of kind, quantity, timing
                        and priority, to determine:</p>

                        <item>b. Whether the present allocation of resources as between U.S.
                            military forces and other free world forces is appropriate.</item>
                        <item>c. Whether the present balance between military assistance and the

                            facing the United States in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East,
                            to the importance of these areas for U.S. security, and to United States

                    <p>I. An analysis of the broad allocation of our resources under present
                        programs and of our security posture in 1954 and the immediately following
                        period.</p>
                    <p>II. An indication of additional high-priority programs which would be
                        desirable to undertake to meet the threats which face us, together with an
                        estimate of the resources which would be required within the next few years
                        to carry out these additional programs.</p>
                    <p>III. An analysis of the possibilities of undertaking the additional programs
                        by a re-allocation of the planned distribution of our resources under
                        present programs, as against the desirability and possibility of increasing
                        the total resources available for meeting our national security
                        programs.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Part I</p>
                    <p rend="center">An Analysis of the Board Allocation of Our Resources Under
                        Present Programs and of Our Security Posture in 1954 and the Immediately
                        Following Period</p>
                    <p rend="center">A. General</p>
                    <p>The main purpose of this section of the study should be to give a very broad
                        picture of the allocation of the United States and free world resources in
                        terms of the main threats which face the United States and the rest of the
                        free world. In order to be useful this analysis should be in terms of a
                        period far enough ahead so that if changes are desired there is time to make
                        such changes effective, and, at the same time, not so distant that useful
                        conclusions are impossible. It is suggested that calendar year 1954 and the
                        immediately following period might be the best for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The first step will be to indicate broadly the resources which are and will
                        be available for allocation. It will be necessary to give a picture of how
                        the security posture of the United States and the free world will develop
                        based on present programs. It will also be necessary to indicate the
                        probable amounts of military, economic and other resources which the United
                        States will make available to its allies.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the United States military programs, the primary problems
                        will probably be to present a meaningful picture of the improvement in
                        United States capabilities as a result of the acquisition of the new
                        matériel which is now and will be in process of procurement through fiscal
                        1954; and of the increased capabilities of the United States with respect to
                        the defense of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that we examine the allocation of our resources to meet the
                        threats to our security in the following five areas:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. Far East (including Southeast Asia)</item>
                        <item>2. Middle East, South Asia, and Africa</item>
                        <item>3. Europe</item>
                        <item>4. Western Hemisphere</item>
                        <item>5. Offensive striking power and general military reserve</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Effort should be made to indicate for each of these areas what resources are
                        being allocated under present programs. This might be done both on an annual
                        and a cumulative basis. The following resources should be covered and should
                        be given both in terms of United States and free world resources:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Deployment of Military Forces</item>
                        <item>b. Military Aid</item>
                        <item>c. Economic Aid</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_129" n="129" facs="0159"/>
                        <item>d. Other Resources—including political and treaty commitments,
                            information programs, covert programs, etc.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>For each of the five areas indicated above, it will be necessary to indicate
                        a general estimate of the security posture which will have been attained
                        during 1954 and the immediately following period as a result of our
                        programs. This will mean an estimate of the threats in the area with respect
                        to general war, local aggression or loss by subversion, together with a
                        broad estimate of the free world’s ability to meet these threats.</p>
                    <p>Finally, an effort should be made to draw some general conclusions as to the
                        balance or lack of balance in our programs with respect to these five areas
                        and with respect to the relative risks we are accepting. In other words, is
                        the position we expect to be in during 1954 and the immediately following
                        period a satisfactory one in each area?</p>
                    <p rend="center">B. Specific</p>
                    <p>A number of assumptions will have to be made in preparing the above data.
                        Broadly speaking, the assumptions should be on the basis that there is no
                        basic change in the international situation between now and 1954. This would
                        include the assumption that the Korean war continues without major change in
                        scope. Other assumptions will have to be developed as we go along. With
                        regard to the deployment of military forces, some assumption will have to be
                        made as to forces not deployed in a particular area but planned and
                        committed to that area. A distinction will have to be made between such
                        forces and our capability to dispatch elements of a flexible general reserve
                        to areas of our choice.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the fourth general area, there will be a number of special
                        problems: (1) the allocation of resources to Latin America although small
                        might be segregated; (2) forces allocated for the defense of the Continental
                        United States, including both military and nonmilitary, will have to be
                        segregated.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Part II</p>
                    <p>An Indication of Additional High-Priority Programs Which Would be Desirable
                        to Undertake to Meet the Threats Which Face Us, Together With an Estimate of
                        the Resources Which Would Be Required Within the Next Few Years to Carry Out
                        These Additional Programs</p>
                    <p>The general purpose of Part II should be to indicate certain geographic areas
                        or functional areas which the analysis in Part I indicates need special
                        attention. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 indicates that there is
                        a tentative view that both the Middle East and the Far East merit a <pb
                            xml:id="pg_130" n="130" facs="0160"/>larger share of our total resources
                        than they are now receiving. Questions have also been raised as to the
                        adequacy of our programs with respect to the Continental United States
                        defense—both military and non-military—in the face of probable Soviet
                        capabilities. Questions have been raised as to the soundness of the present
                        ratio between our programs of military and economic assistance in Europe. An
                        immediate start should be made on these problems in an effort to put forward
                        a tentative high-priority program for the utilization of a larger amount or
                        different types of resources in these areas than is now contemplated. It
                        will be important to have a realistic estimate of the additional resources
                        which could be utilized to good advantage in these areas, as well as a
                        breakdown of the amount of each type of resource needed. Some indication
                        would have to be given of what such a program could be expected to
                        accomplish in terms of United States and free world security.</p>

                            requirements and capabilities. At the same time the United States should
                            encourage and as appropriate assist in the development of indigenous
                            forces and regional defense arrangements capable of bearing an
                            increasing share of responsibility for resisting local communist
                            aggression. When U.S. forces are committed to <pb xml:id="pg_135"
                                n="135" facs="0165"/>combat a local aggression, the action should
                            whenever possible be of sufficient strength and scope to effect a
                            decision favorable to the United States.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The present paragraph reads:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“b. Encourage and as appropriate assist in the development of
                            indigenous forces and regional defense and collective security
                            arrangements capable of sharing responsibility for resisting local
                            communist aggression. At the same time the United States should be
                            increasingly willing, in support of its security objectives in key
                            geographical areas, to use its resources, as appropriate in cooperation
                            with its allies, and to take collective military action against
                            aggression. To this end, the reexamination called for under subparagraph
                            a above should include the necessary study of requirements, capabilities
                            and appropriate arrangements. Any decision to use United States forces
                            would, of course, be made at the time in the light of the prevailing
                            circumstances.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The revised paragraph appears to be a considerable watering down of the
                        earlier wording “to commit military forces”. In addition, it emphasizes
                        “collective military action” and limits promised action to supporting
                        “security objectives”. In effect, revised wording goes no further than
                        existing policy. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1"
                            >Nitze</persName> and I recommend that that you accept the revised
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 11 on economic measures and international trade policy studies is
                        acceptable to Mr. Thorp.</p>
                    <p>The new wording in Paragraph 14 on mobilization policy is Defense language
                        and is acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 1 now includes the reference to peace and the UN. Reluctantly, the
                        Defense representative on the Senior Staff agreed to drop its proposed
                        rewriting of the fundamental objectives of the U.S. and Mr. <persName

                        with this language.</p>

                    <p>At the conclusion of the briefing on the situation in the Far East, The
                        President turned to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/2 and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> explained that the present
                        report constituted a redraft of the paper which had been considered by the
                        Council at an earlier meeting. The President referred to the recommendations
                        of the Senior Staff for a revision of the present paper and then called upon
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> for his
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName> stated that in
                        its present form and with the additional sentence recommended by the Senior
                        Staff he found the paper entirely satisfactory. He did, however, desire to
                        comment on the reasons for the additional sentence. This was, he said, in
                        the nature of a caveat in that the areas in point were Southeast Asia and
                        the Middle East. These were areas in which it had proved very difficult to
                        provide for any satisfactory collective security arrangements. It was
                        therefore necessary that the policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        135/2 make it very clear that the United States did not intend to confine
                        its role in defense against aggression to areas which already had
                        satisfactory collective security arrangments. It was also necessary <pb
                            xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0167"/>to point out, continued Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>, that the influence
                        of the United States is far more important in these areas than it had even
                        been before owing to the decline of British and French prestige and
                        power.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he understood Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>’s concern and added that it
                        was extremely difficult to get the American people to realize the increased
                        size of our responsibility in such areas. The President then asked Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOSTERWC1">Foster</persName> for his views.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOSTERWC1">Foster</persName> replied that he
                        found the draft of the present report satisfactory and concurred in the
                        suggestion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1">Acheson</persName>
                        that the word “over-all” be deleted from the proposed additional
                        paragraph.</p>
                    <p>After The President had inquired whether any other members of the Council
                        desired to comment on the report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1"
                            >Fowler</persName> stated that he would like to speak briefly on two
                        points in the report, largely in terms of information and emphasis of
                        statements made in the report. These related to the statements in paragraphs
                        9–a and 16–a with respect to the level of resources allocated to the
                        national security programs in general and to the capacity of the economy to
                        accelerate the production of certain selected military end items. He added
                        that he had at hand a somewhat lengthy memorandum on these points which he
                        would transmit to the Executive Secretary for circulation to the Council
                        members. Meanwhile, however, he desired to emphasize that analyses of the
                        materials situation and allied problems recently completed in the Office of
                        Defense Mobilization afforded clear evidence that certain of the national
                        security programs could be rapidly accelerated in the latter half of
                        Calendar 1953 and Calendar 1954 if it was deemed desirable to do so. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName> stated that it was no
                        longer necessary to make the difficult choice between production of end
                        items and the expansion of the mobilization base in many categories of key
                        weapons. In fact, so much progress had been made in the last year in solving
                        this problem that we are now confronted by a new choice of alternatives. We
                        can, if we desire, continue to adhere to the stretched out schedule which,
                        until recently, we have felt obliged to follow or we can now take advantage
                        of the solution of many earlier problems and accelerate production very
                        sharply. In other words, we no longer need to adhere to the stretched out
                        schedules for many selected items. This is certainly feasible, but it was
                        largely up to the Defense Department to determine whether it was actually
                        desirable to attain our original objectives at a much earlier date. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName> also pointed out that
                        the analyses from which he was quoting also meant good news for the
                        stockpile program, as also for non-military, as well as military aid to our
                        Allies, Furthermore, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName>
                        said, it was the conviction of the Stabilization people <pb xml:id="pg_138"
                            n="138" facs="0168"/>that the hypothetical acceleration which he was
                        describing could be handled in such a way as not unduly to disturb the
                        stabilization program or to induce severe inflationary pressures beyond
                        those already in existence. In conclusion, however, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName> warned of the importance of
                        timing and indicated that we must be informed well in advance if the desired
                        acceleration was to be undertaken.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName>’s
                        remarks, The President stated that if he heard no objection the paper stood
                        approved by the Council.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative and said that he had brought up his problem at the previous
                        Council meeting but felt that it was so urgent that he must state his case
                        once again. After referring to the chronic inability of his own agency and
                        others, such as Civil Defense, to get adequate guidance for the formulation
                        of workable passive defense programs, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1"
                            >Gorrie</persName> informed the Council that he had recently talked at
                        some length with individuals who were engaged in projects such as the East
                        River Project. <note n="8" xml:id="d27fn8">Regarding the East River Project,
                            see <ref target="#d9fn2">footnote 2</ref>, p. 20.</note> Many of these
                        scientists and technicians had changed their minds and abandoned their
                        previous pessimistic estimates about the possibility of developing a more
                        adequate early warning system for the defense of the Continental United
                        States. He therefore desired to reopen the problem which he had discussed at
                        the previous meeting <pb xml:id="pg_139" n="139" facs="0169"/>of the Council
                        and to pass out copies of a memorandum setting forth these new
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> noted that the original
                        costs of providing a more adequate early warning system were now thought to
                        be much less than had originally been estimated and cited figures to
                        indicate the reduction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1"
                            >Gorrie</persName> then noted the urgency of the problem and the
                        importance of time. If we continue with conventional methods it will take
                        many years to develop a reasonable early warning program, but if given
                        preferred treatment and taking advantage of new technological discoveries
                        this task might be accomplished in two or three years.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he thought the subject of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName>’s remarks, and of his
                        memorandum, was of the greatest importance. He said he had not intended that
                        it should be a specific subject for consideration at this meeting but that
                        he was anxious for all around the table to give it careful attention before
                        the Budget for the next Fiscal Year had been firmed up.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOSTERWC1">Foster</persName> stated that he
                        feared that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName>’s figures
                        for the cost of building a reasonable early warning system were a little
                        optimistic. It looked to him, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_FOSTERWC1">Foster</persName>, like a major job, in terms of
                        cost, to provide a system which would assure three to six hours of warning
                        in advance of an attack.</p>
                    <p>After further comment The President stated his desire that a survey be
                        undertaken to see what could and should be done in this field.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/2 was approved with the amendment to
                        paragraph 9b recommended by the Senior Staff. I made the statement regarding
                        9b which was suggested at this afternoon’s briefing and this was received
                        with apparent approval by all.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the meeting, two matters were brought up of some
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>1. Joe <persName corresp="#p_FOWLERHH1">Fowler</persName> made a statement
                        bearing on paragraph 9a and paragraph 16a. He says that he has a report
                        available bearing on this matter which would be accessible to those making
                        the reexamination called for by 135/2. The report, as I understand it, is to
                        the effect that the work on the expansion of our mobilization base has now
                        proceeded so far that it is possible to have a very considerable increase in
                        the production of various end items without adding to our inflationary
                        troubles or interfering with civilian demand. This production might take the
                        form of military end items of certain sorts which did not require
                        redesigning of plant or tools. It might also take the form of exports of
                        producers goods should these be needed in connection with foreign aid or
                        foreign investment. He thinks that acceleration could show results, if it
                        were approved immediately, by the middle of 1953. This is a matter which I
                        think Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Nitze</persName> will wish to look
                        into.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Jack Gorrie</persName> distributed the
                        attached paper. After having the paper read, the President said that he was
                        not suggesting any action on it at the present time. He thought that members
                        of the Council might wish separately or together to discuss the matter with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName> and to have all
                        documents in his possession which substantiated his position. Here again is
                        a matter which I think will require investigation. The President
                        contemplates the possibility of a later discussion and possible action in
                        regard to allocating funds. The Acting Secretary of Defense put in a caveat
                        that this was a much disputed field; that he thought the costs would be
                        vastly in excess of those suggested in the paper, and that the scientific
                        developments were disputed by other scientists of equal repute.</p>

                            >NSC</gloss> 135/1, I submitted a written statement of my views
                        regarding the need for more adequate policy guidance as a basis on which to
                        plan the Nation’s passive defense programs.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">
                            <hi rend="italic">Ante,</hi>

                    </p>
                    <p>Unless an effective military defense of the continental United States can be
                        developed, it is impossible to provide meaningful policy guidance to civil
                        defense regarding shelter or evacuation programs for civilians, and for the
                        protection and continuity of war industry.</p>
                    <p>In raising the question of the adequacy of military defense programs, it is
                        again made clear that this does not suggest improving military defense at
                        the expense of programs that project our strength outward toward the enemy.
                        The question is that of adequacy and relationship of our combined defense
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>An effective early warning system is important to both the protective
                        military and passive defense of the continental United States. <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/1 points out that in their growing
                        atomic strength, the Soviets are creating a capability for critical attack
                        on the United States.</p>
                    <p>Data provided by scientists and engineers associated with projects <persName
                            corresp="#p_LINCOLNCGA1">Lincoln</persName>,
                            <persName>Charles</persName>, Hartwell, and East River and with the Rand
                        Corporation, indicate that recent technological developments now make it
                        possible to control the advantage of surprise by providing effective early
                        warning. Furthermore, we are advised that the cost of such a warning system
                        would be a nominal fraction of current military outlays; its manpower
                        requirements would be small. It can be operational within two to three years
                        if undertaken now, according to experts who have been studying this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The scientists who supply this information emphasize that, as recently as two
                        years ago, they held the view that effective early warning was infeasible.
                        Technological break throughs, which promise a solution to the problem, have
                        occurred only in recent months.</p>
                    <p>They recommend that $100 million be provided immediately for expediting the
                        further development and initial installation of a new continental early
                        warning system which incorporates these technological improvements. They
                        estimate that in order to complete <pb xml:id="pg_142" n="142" facs="0172"
                        />the full warning system in depth, an additional $250 million per annum may
                        be required for each of the following three to four years.</p>
                    <p>Early warning of three to six hours is now possible, according to scientists
                        who say this would make defense in depth feasible. It is only with the
                        assurance of early warning and defense in depth that an adequate program of
                        civil defense, the evacuation or shelter of civilians and the protection of
                        war industry can be planned.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that the Department of Defense now has these problems under
                        study. However, the purpose of this memorandum is to urge the <hi

                            the case for approval by the President, direct or through the <gloss

                            the subject to the Department of State, “it was understood that State
                            should see the presentation before it goes to the President” upon his

                    <p>1. Reappraisal of United States objectives and strategy for national security
                        reaffirms the basic purposes and policies of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 20, 68 and 114 Series. The fundamental purpose of the
                        United States remains as stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68:
                        to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society founded upon the
                        dignity and worth of the individual, while promoting peace and order among
                        nations in a system based on freedom and justice as contemplated in the
                        Charter of the United Nations. Pursuit of this fundamental purpose should
                        continue to be through that general policy which seeks:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To develop throughout the world positive appeals superior to those
                            of communism.</item>
                        <item>b. To block further expansion of Soviet power even at grave risk of
                            general war.</item>
                        <item>c. Without deliberately incurring grave risk of general war, to induce
                            a retraction of the Kremlin’s control and influence, and so to foster
                            the seeds of destruction within the Soviet system that the Soviet bloc
                            is brought at least to the point of modifying its behavior to conform to
                            generally accepted international standards.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. We continue to believe that the free world with its superior resources
                        should be able to build and maintain, for whatever length of time proves to
                        be necessary, such strength that the Soviet orbit will be unable to make
                        significant advances in expanding its power, either geographically or
                        politically. Moreover if the free world develops such strength, the internal
                        conflicts of the Soviet totalitarian system should, with positive effort
                        from us, subsequently cause a retraction of Soviet power and influence and
                        eventually cause that system gradually to weaken and decay, although no time
                        limit can be established by which these objectives will be achieved.</p>
                    <p>3. Although no fundamental departures from the conclusions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20 and 68 Series are required, it is
                        essential that we take into account certain factors that have developed or
                        acquired new significance since the adoption of these reports:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The United States and its major allies have responded to the
                            perilous situation of 1950; they have responded collectively to the
                            attack upon South Korea; they are improving the security position <pb
                                xml:id="pg_145" n="145" facs="0175"/>in Western Europe and in the
                            Pacific; they, and particularly the United States, have significantly
                            improved their readiness for war. These efforts, though not yet
                            complete, have already reenforced the deterrents to general war and
                            reaffirmed the reasoning of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 by
                            which both preventive war and isolation were rejected as courses of
                            action.</item>
                        <item>b. There has also been a substantial further development of Soviet
                            orbit strength since 1950. Modernization and expansion programs in the
                            Soviet, satellite, and Chinese Communist armed forces are proceeding,
                            supported by a rapidly growing economic and industrial capacity and by a
                            high level of scientific and technical capability in selected fields of
                            vital military importance. As a result of the developing atomic and
                            possible thermonuclear capability of the USSR, the vulnerability of the
                            United States to direct attack, which is now serious, will in a few
                            years probably assume critical proportions. On the other hand, the USSR
                            has been seriously vulnerable for some time and will also probably
                            become critically vulnerable to our own developing atomic and possible
                            thermonuclear capability.</item>
                        <item>c. Although there is continuing danger of general war, the most
                            immediate danger facing the United States is that a progressive and
                            cumulative loss of positions of importance to the United States (either
                            as a result of deterioration within the free nations or of communist
                            cold war actions or a process involving both) could eventually reduce
                            the United States, short of general war, to an isolated and critically
                            vulnerable position.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. In the light of these concurrent developments, it must remain the
                        immediate and, we believe, attainable objective of the free world to develop
                        and sustain for as long as may be necessary such over-all strength as will
                        (a) continuously confront the Kremlin with the prospect that a Soviet attack
                        would result in serious risk to the Soviet regime, and thus maximize the
                        chance that general war will be indefinitely deterred, (b) provide the basis
                        for winning a general war should it occur, (c) reduce the opportunities for
                        local Soviet or satellite aggression and political warfare, (d) provide an
                        effective counter to local aggression, if it occurs, in key peripheral
                        areas, and (e) permit the exploitation of rifts between the USSR and other
                        communist states and between the satellite regimes and the peoples they are
                        oppressing. The United States should accordingly pursue with determination
                        and constancy, and in keeping with the threat, the courses of action set
                        forth in the following paragraphs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Deterrent to General War</p>
                    <p>5. The United States should develop and maintain, in cooperation with its
                        allies, a position of strength, flexibility and depth adequate to deter the
                        Soviets from deliberately initiating general war and to discourage them from
                        pursuing courses of action involving grave risk of general war.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_146" n="146" facs="0176"/>
                    <p>6. To achieve such a deterrent, the United States should take the necessary
                        measures to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Develop the political unity of and encourage the growth of strength
                            and determination in the free world so as to minimize the likelihood
                            that the Soviets would believe they could undertake local aggression
                            without serious risk of war.</item>
                        <item>b. Develop and retain, under all foreseeable conditions, the
                            capability to inflict massive damage on the Soviet war-making
                            capacity.</item>
                        <item>c. Assure ready defensive strength, both military and non-military,
                            adequate to provide in the event of general war a reasonable initial
                            defense and to ensure reasonable protection to the nation during the
                            period of mobilization for ultimate victory.</item>
                        <item>d. Round out and maintain the mobilization base, both military and
                            industrial, in the United States at a level which in the event of need
                            will enable us to expand rapidly to full mobilization; and, consistent
                            with the maintenance of a vital and democratic society, provide the
                            means for protecting the mobilization base against covert attack and
                            sabotage.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>7. In the light of the capacity of the USSR to deliver an atomic and possible
                        thermonuclear attack, the United States should develop a substantially
                        improved civil defense as an essential part of the total national security
                        program in order to (a) provide reasonable protection for the American
                        people and maintain their morale, thereby enhancing the freedom of action of
                        the U.S. Government, and (b) minimize damage to war production plants and
                        facilities and increase the capability of the country’s economy to recover.
                        At the same time the American people should recognize their vital role in
                        the total program of national security, and be prepared to accept and live
                        with a substantial degree of vulnerability in fulfilling that role.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Outside the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>8. A preliminary study of problems in the areas outside the Soviet orbit
                        brings out some major causes of concern which indicate the need for a
                        restudy and possible change of emphasis and redirection of certain of our
                        efforts with respect to those areas. These causes of concern are the
                        following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Our major European allies, particularly the United Kingdom and
                            France, may not have the political and economic capacity (a) to make a
                            fully adequate contribution to the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and (b) to support their existing responsibilities
                            outside of Europe.</item>
                        <item>b. Present indigenous political and military strength in areas on the
                            periphery of the Soviet orbit, even when reinforced by the readily
                            deployable reserve strength of the United States and its allies, is
                            insufficient to permit us to escape from the possibility of having to
                            accept, in the face of local aggression, either the eventual further
                            expansion of Soviet power, inconclusive local counteraction, or general
                            war.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_147" n="147" facs="0177"/>
                    <p>c. Serious internal instability in many areas, caused in varying degrees by
                        the activities of indigenous communist parties, rabid nationalism, economic
                        and political backwardness, and defeatist neutralism, and stimulated by
                        aggressive Soviet and satellite propaganda directed chiefly against the
                        United States, threatens to create conditions where communist influence and
                        control may be extended without Soviet aggression unless effective counter
                        measures are taken.</p>
                    <p>9. In the light of the above, the United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Reexamine the amounts and allocations of resources to various areas
                            in terms of kind, quantity, timing and priority, to determine (1)
                            whether a general increase in the level of free world programs and
                            military forces is required to deal with the several threats; (2)
                            whether the present allocation of resources as between U.S. military
                            forces and other free world forces is appropriate; (3) whether the
                            present balance between military assistance and the various types of
                            economic assistance is appropriate; and (4) whether these allocations
                            are in proper relationship to the threats facing the United States in
                            Europe, the Far East and the Middle East, to the importance of these
                            areas for U.S. security, and to United States commitments.</item>
                        <item>b. Encourage and as appropriate assist in the development of
                            indigenous forces and regional defense and collective security
                            arrangements capable of sharing responsibility for resisting local
                            communist aggression. At the same time the United States should be
                            increasingly willing, in support of its security objectives in key
                            geographical areas, to use its resources, as appropriate in cooperation
                            with its allies, and to take collective military action against
                            aggression. (This is not intended to preclude the possibility of the use
                            of our military forces unilaterally when under the particular
                            circumstances it is in our best interests to do so.) To this end, the
                            reexamination called for under sub-paragraph a above should include the
                            necessary study of requirements, capabilities and appropriate
                            arrangements. Any decision to use United States forces would, of course,
                            be made at the time in the light of the prevailing circumstances.</item>
                        <item>c. Increase its efforts to promote internal stability in critical
                            areas outside the Soviet orbit. Here the United States should conduct,
                            with greater vigor, political warfare operations as an integral part of
                            its over-all strategy, in order to reduce communist and neutralist
                            influence, combat anti-American propaganda, and create stronger support
                            for the purposes of United States foreign policy. Particular emphasis
                            should be placed on measures directed against the effectiveness of local
                            communist parties.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas Within the Soviet Orbit</p>
                    <p>10. Where operations can be conducted on terms which may result in a relative
                        decrease in Soviet power without involving unacceptable risks, the United
                        States should pursue and as practicable intensify positive political,
                        economic, propaganda, and paramilitary operations against the Soviet orbit,
                        particularly those operations <pb xml:id="pg_148" n="148" facs="0178"
                        />designed to weaken Kremlin control over the satellites and the military
                        potential of the Soviet system. However, we should not over-estimate the
                        effectiveness of the activities we can pursue within the Soviet orbit, and
                        should proceed with a careful weighing of the risks against the possible
                        gains in pressing upon what the Kremlin probably regards as its vital
                        interests.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Measures</p>
                    <p>11. The United States should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Utilize its economic power as feasible to facilitate the growth of
                            strength, stability and unity in the free world. United States
                            international economic policies, including trade policy, the promotion
                            of raw material development and supplies, the stimulation of investment
                            abroad, and financial relations among the nations of the free world
                            should, where necessary, be adjusted to make sure that they contribute
                            to the greatest possible extent to the achievement of our security
                            objectives. In this connection, relevant studies already under way
                            should be utilized. The provision of economic and technical assistance
                            should be coordinated with these policies so that, in operation, the
                            several elements of our strength will be mutually supporting. Such
                            assistance should also be closely related to military and political
                            policies and aid should be allocated in the light of the reexamination
                            specified in paragraph 9–a above.</item>
                        <item>b. Be prepared to utilize its economic resources to forestall, or if
                            necessary to resolve favorably, political crises which pose a threat to
                            U.S. security interests.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Support</p>
                    <p>12. The United States should undertake systematically and consistently a
                        program of clarifying to the American public and to other peoples of the
                        free world the complex problems of the free world in meeting the Soviet
                        threat, the nature of that threat, the strength and resources the free world
                        possesses to meet that threat, and to the extent possible the reasoning
                        behind the general lines of policy and action described herein, in order to
                        secure that public understanding and support which is essential to the
                        success of our policies and actions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiation</p>
                    <p>13. The United States, in cooperation with its allies, should develop a sound
                        negotiating position in any question or dispute involving the USSR and
                        should be prepared to enter into negotiations with the Soviet Union if they
                        offer promise of achieving acceptable <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi,</hi>
                        or if, for other reasons, they appear to be desirable. On the other hand we
                        should recognize that only enforceable agreements are meaningful and that
                        the major contributions of negotiation in the foreseeable future may be to
                        convince the <pb xml:id="pg_149" n="149" facs="0179"/>world of the validity
                        and sincerity of our position and to serve as a political warfare
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mobilization Policy</p>
                    <p>14. The United States should continue to pursue a policy of limited
                        mobilization designed to develop and maintain a favorable power position
                        sufficient to support the security objectives and strategy of the United
                        States without resort to an armament effort so large as to disrupt the
                        economies of the free nations. In view of the fact that our mobilization
                        effort must meet a situation in which general war might be forced on us at
                        any time, or might be avoided indefinitely, it should be designed
                        concurrently to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Develop forces and matériel adequate to attain the objectives set
                            forth in paragraph 4 and which can be maintained for so long as may be
                            required.</item>
                        <item>b. Enable the military forces of the U.S. and our allies to achieve a
                            high state of readiness as soon as feasible.</item>
                        <item>c. Support the expansion of our basic industrial potential
                            concurrently with an expansion of essential armament capacity.</item>
                        <item>d. Achieve a high level of production of long lead-time military items
                            as soon as feasible.</item>
                        <item>e. Maintain a broad base of production for military end products and
                            keep these production lines active over as long a period as
                            feasible.</item>
                        <item>f. Safeguard and increase the economic and fiscal strength of the
                            nation as the essential foundation upon which an indefinitely sustained
                            military program must rest.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>13. The adequacy of currently projected mobilization goals is a question
                        separate from that of the soundness of the concept of limited mobilization.
                        Appraisal of the present goals must be accomplished on a continuing basis as
                        the various programs are fulfilled and in light of changes in the world
                        situation. The rapid growth of the Soviet atomic capability, the prospect
                        for our continued heavy commitment in Korea, the serious threat to Southeast
                        Asia, the danger of further deterioration of the situations in Iran and
                        Egypt, the grave implications of further Soviet efforts to force the Western
                        powers out of Berlin—all of these portents underline the risks involved in
                        the projected rates of delivery and in adhering to presently programmed
                        force levels.</p>
                    <p>16. Recognizing the above risks and objectives in the light of the situation

                        National Security</p>
                    <p rend="center">Summary and General Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. If the Soviet rulers should attain, in their judgment, the capability of
                        defeating the United States or of so reducing its power potential as to
                        render it permanently incapable of effectively challenging Soviet power and
                        if they should come to believe that such action would not involve serious
                        risk to the maintenance of their regime, they would probably deliberately
                        initiate general war.</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviets might attack the West if they were convinced as a matter of
                        fact, rather than theory, than an attack by the West was actually
                        imminent.</p>
                    <p>3. Nor can it be excluded that if in the eyes of the Soviet leaders
                        developments in the power balance appeared directly and imminently to
                        threaten the security of the Soviet Union or areas under its control, they
                        might feel compelled to force certain outstanding issues in such a way that
                        the result might well be the outbreak of war without any deliberate
                        intention on the part of the Soviet Union to bring about such an event.</p>
                    <p>4. War could come from communist action based on initial Soviet
                        miscalculation of the free world’s interest in and reaction to the situation
                        in some particular area.</p>
                    <p>5. War could come from a deadlocked situation in which basic interests of
                        both parties are involved with an act of one side setting off an unwinding
                        chain of action and reaction which neither side would be able fully to
                        control.</p>
                    <p>6. In the absence of general war, the Soviet leadership will probably
                        continue a pushing and probing exploitation of all weaknesses in the free
                        world. This means that the Soviets can be expected to continue their efforts
                        to consolidate and expand their influence in Asia; undermine U.S. leadership
                        of the free world; break the unity of the West; prevent the integration of
                        West Germany and Japan into the Western system; disrupt the economies and
                        governmental effectiveness of our major continental European allies; and
                        exploit <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0181"/>the intemperate nationalism
                        and political instability of the Middle and Far East. Thus, there continues
                        to be danger of such a progressive and cumulative loss of positions of
                        importance to the United States (either as a result of deterioration within
                        the free nations or of communist cold war actions or a process involving
                        both) that the United States would eventually be reduced short of general
                        war to an isolated and critically vulnerable position.</p>
                    <p>7. The Soviet orbit now has formidable military capabilities. It has
                        succeeded in maintaining large and increasingly well-equipped Soviet armed
                        forces, in expanding and improving the satellite armed and para-military
                        forces, and in developing significant atomic, electronic and possibly <gloss
                            target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>
                        capabilities. The Soviet long-range air force is capable of atomic attack on
                        the United States and might achieve surprise in the initial strike. The
                        Soviets would be able to support extensive military operations of an
                        offensive nature during the early phases of a general war with reserve
                        stocks and military forces in being.</p>
                    <p>8. The Soviet orbit is expanding its current production; it is also expanding
                        its industrial, economic, and scientific potential. Many of these latter
                        developments are long range in nature. The USSR has demonstrated a high
                        level of scientific and technical capability in several vital military
                        fields, notably nuclear energy, aircraft design and production, electronics
                        and chemical warfare.</p>
                    <p>9. The United States and its major allies have responded to the perilous
                        situation of 1950; they have responded collectively to the attack upon South
                        Korea; they are improving the security position in Western Europe and in the
                        Pacific; they, and particularly the United States have significantly
                        improved their readiness for war.</p>
                    <p>10. The United States is increasing its atomic strength and may soon develop
                        a thermonuclear weapon. There is, in fact, every indication that its present
                        advantage in atomic weapons stockpile and in the production of fissionable
                        materials will be further increased; and means for their delivery exist. The
                        U.S. is also developing an increasing variety and quantity of mass
                        destruction weapons and means for their delivery; well dispersed overseas
                        bases are being established within range of the sources of Soviet political
                        and industrial power.</p>
                    <p>11. The United States and other countries in the free world are engaged in a
                        mobilization program which is designed both to facilitate any future shift
                        to a war economy and to maintain a substantial level of strength over an
                        extended period. Moreover, the United States has the economic capacity to
                        sustain a generally higher level of armament production than is contemplated
                        by currently projected programs and is capable of accelerating the
                        production of selected items within the framework of present programs. <pb
                            xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0182"/>Such an increase in the level of
                        armament production would, however, require a willingness in the United
                        States and allied countries to accept an increased diversion of scarce
                        materials and other resources to such production through more severe direct
                        physical controls. In addition more vigorous price and credit controls and a
                        heavier tax burden would be required in order to protect the economies of
                        these nations.</p>
                    <p>12. The free world enjoys a very substantial superiority in basic productive
                        potential over the Soviet orbit, but this superiority is not the sole
                        measure of the relative ability to undertake large armament programs over an
                        extended period in the absence of general war. The Soviet orbit, through its
                        total control over the Soviet economy and population, can utilize a high
                        proportion of the Soviet orbit resources and potential to achieve and
                        maintain the present level of military preparedness. In the absence of
                        general war, it is far more difficult for the free world to achieve an
                        adequate utilization of its resources and potential to counter the Soviet
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>13. Moreover, the increasingly destructive power that will be available to
                        both sides could make it more difficult to ensure the effective conversion
                        of the economies to full war production. In planning the utilization of its
                        resources in the absence of general war, therefore, the free world cannot
                        give the same weight as in previous wars to its heavy preponderance of
                        productive capacity and economic potential as the determining factor in
                        preventing or winning a general war.</p>
                    <p>14. Because of improved methods of delivery, in combination with increased
                        atomic and possibly thermonuclear weapon stockpiles, the Soviet orbit will
                        probably acquire during the next several years a capability to damage
                        critically the United States and its allies. Defensive counter-measures now
                        in prospect probably cannot prevent the Soviet orbit from achieving such a
                        capability, although such measures can certainly postpone the time of its
                        achievement. The same reasoning would apply in general to the defensive
                        position of the Soviet orbit. The free world for its own protection must
                        take measures to improve active and passive defense, including the
                        exploration of new technological possibilities, but nevertheless must
                        probably accept a substantial degree of vulnerability and avoid
                        disproportionate concentration of resources on defense at the expense of
                        measures necessary to project its strength outward to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>15. Taking account of all these factors, the strongest deterrent to general
                        war will be the achievement and maintenance of such an overall position of
                        strength by the free world as will force the Soviets to recognize the
                        undesirability of challenging it. The United <pb xml:id="pg_153" n="153"
                            facs="0183"/>States and its allies hold it within their power to achieve
                        and maintain such a position of strength.</p>
                    <p>16. In Europe a continued improvement in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> military posture is essential (a) further to reinforce the
                        deterrent to general war, (b) to provide a sounder military position in the
                        event of general war, (c) to strengthen the confidence of our European
                        allies and their determination to stand firm in the face of further Soviet
                        provocation. Greece and Turkey, with their significant forces, are being
                        successfully integrated in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>;
                        Greek-Turkish-Yugoslav military cooperation is beginning to develop; the
                        juridical basis for Western German rearmament is being established; and
                        Spain’s participation in Western defense plans is a developing prospect.
                        However, our major European allies, particularly the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> and France, are encountering major obstacles in making a
                        fully adequate contribution to the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and in supporting their existing responsibilities outside
                        Europe. The volume and rate of delivery of U.S. assistance, which in turn
                        depends upon production and availability of material, is a major factor in
                        determining the size and timing of the genuinely effective forces which can
                        be created. On balance, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        commitments, and such additional declarations as those of the United States
                        and its allies concerning Berlin, together with European efforts and U.S.
                        assistance, have made it clear that military action by the USSR or its
                        satellites would almost certainly lead to general war. It is therefore
                        unlikely that the Soviet orbit will take military action there unless it is
                        prepared to engage in general war.</p>
                    <p>17. Apart from the above problem of military capabilities, the Western
                        European powers continue to be confronted with serious political, economic
                        and social problems despite substantial advances, with U.S. assistance,
                        towards greater stability and cohesion. These problems have derived from
                        economic conditions, political instability, neutralist tendencies, social
                        tensions, and, in France and Italy, the continued existence of large and
                        powerful Communist parties. Although genuine progress has been made, further
                        efforts by the Western European countries and U.S. assistance to them will
                        be required to overcome these adverse elements and to continue the progress
                        towards political, economic and social stability, and collective defense in
                        Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>18. Present and threatened communist aggression and subversion in the Far
                        East and Middle East (excepting Turkey) currently pose immediate dangers to
                        the free world position.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. In the Middle East, efforts to maintain or enhance political
                            stability have not succeeded. Recent developments in Iran, and to a
                            lesser extent Egypt, have emphasized the danger that trends in this area
                            may lead to the denial of its resources to the free world’s <pb
                                xml:id="pg_154" n="154" facs="0184"/>security efforts and eventually
                            to the loss of important countries in Communist control. The U.S. may
                            soon have to consider assuming additional responsibilities in the
                            area.</item>
                        <item>b. In South Asia and the Far East, the inexperience of the present
                            leadership and lack of a firm popular base hampers the ability of
                            various countries to strengthen themselves internally and to cope with
                            communist and extremist pressures. The continued rise of nationalism in
                            these areas has created divisive conflicts. This nationalism represents
                            a reaction against former or remaining colonial controls and creates
                            weaknesses in the free world as a whole.</item>
                        <item>c. In Indochina, where the situation is most acute, an increase of
                            strength has enabled the French Union forces to stand off the communists
                            but has not brought them within sight of success.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the Middle and Far East there is evident need for aid programs of such
                        flexibility and so related to political factors as to contribute to the
                        solution of critical problems in unstable areas. Moreover in the Middle and
                        Far East, the USSR, by instigating direct or indirect aggression, can force
                        the Western powers to choose among (a) suffering the loss of these areas by
                        default, (b) fighting defensive local action for limited objectives, or (c)
                        treating local aggression as a cause for general war.</p>
                    <p>19. Despite the vital interest of the free world, measures to deal with a
                        sudden worsening of situations in the Far and Middle East are not now
                        adequately provided for under present programs, priorities and force levels.
                        In the circumstances, the questions arise (a) whether these serious threats
                        can be met by a redistribution of the free world’s effort presently
                        programmed, or (b) whether consideration must be given to increasing the
                        total effort, or (c) both.</p>
                    <p>20. Over the next several years, with the accumulation on both sides of
                        atomic and other mass destruction weapons, the developing situation may
                        present a continuing and possibly improved opportunity for Soviet expansion
                        by the techniques of political warfare and local aggression if the free
                        world permits the fear and threat of general war to paralyze its reaction to
                        such threats.</p>
                    <p>21. In the light of the present threats and foreseeable developments, as
                        outlined above, it appears that the ability of the free world to maintain
                        its position and progress toward its objectives will come increasingly to
                        depend upon: (a) its capacity to stand firm against Soviet political
                        warfare, which may be intensified by the increasing Soviet atomic
                        capabilities, (b) a greater capability and greater willingness than have
                        been demonstrated to commit appropriate forces and material for limited
                        objectives, and (c) its ability to develop greater stability in peripheral
                        and other unstable areas.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_155" n="155" facs="0185"/>
                    <p>22. Outside the Soviet orbit there exists a need for increased and more
                        selective political warfare operations by the United States and its allies
                        to combat:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The threat of local communist parties, which remains serious
                            although the United States and its allies have demonstrated the ability
                            to weaken communist organizations and reduce the communist potential for
                            revolution and sabotage.</item>
                        <item>b. USSR propaganda directed with particular force against the United
                            States.</item>
                        <item>c. In many parts of the world, distrust of the United States which
                            weakens affirmative support for the purposes of the United
                            States.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>23. Against the Soviet orbit itself, by skillful execution, the United States
                        and its allies may sap the morale of satellite leaders and encourage rifts
                        between the USSR and the satellite countries, and over a period of years may
                        gradually force the Kremlin to an increasing preoccupation with internal
                        security. By appropriate economic measures, the U.S. and its allies can help
                        to deprive the Soviet orbit of needed resources and retard the development
                        of Soviet orbit military potential. It should be recognized, however, that
                        measures of these types alone, however vigorously pursued against the Soviet
                        orbit, cannot be counted on drastically to reduce the threat which the
                        Soviet system poses to the free world.</p>
                    <p>24. During the next few years, it is unlikely that broad settlements can be
                        negotiated with the USSR for the Kremlin will probably not feel that the
                        power relationship obliges it to make significant concessions to the free
                        world. This situation could change in the course of time, particularly if
                        Germany and Japan were to be restored to strength and firmly aligned with
                        the free world; but during the next several years the prospect for
                        negotiations of general agreements is negligible, although specific
                        agreements on a <hi rend="italic">quid-pro-quo</hi> basis, such as an
                        armistice in Korea, are not precluded. Nevertheless, development of a sound
                        U.S. negotiating position in any question or dispute involving the USSR
                        would help to convince the world of the validity and sincerity of our
                        position and would serve as a political warfare weapon.</p>
                    <p>25. While recognizing the admitted elements of strength of the Soviet world
                        and the as yet un-marshalled over-all strength and obvious points of
                        weakness of the free world, we continue to believe that the free world with
                        its superior resources should be able to build and maintain, for whatever
                        length of time proves to be necessary, such strength that the Soviet orbit
                        will be unable to make significant advances in expanding its power, either
                        geographically or politically. Moreover, if the free world develops such
                        strength, the internal conflicts of the Soviet totalitarian system should,
                        with <pb xml:id="pg_156" n="156" facs="0186"/>positive effort from us,
                        subsequently cause a retraction of Soviet power and influence and eventually
                        cause that system gradually to weaken and decay, although no time limit can
                        be established by which these objectives will be achieved.</p>
                    <p>26. During the past two years, the free world has made considerable progress
                        toward building such strength. However, in view of the dangers and
                        difficulties facing us in the next few years, a reexamination of the
                        adequacy of current U.S. national security programs from the standpoint of
                        size, relative priority, and allocation is required.</p></frus:attachment>

                        states <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that a re-examination of existing

                    <p>Because both of these steps would affect the broad question of the level of
                        national security programs in the last half of fiscal 1953 and in fiscal
                        1954,I have had prepared a detailed projection of the materials outlook, a
                        suggestive analysis of military production programs which may advantageously
                        be accelerated, and a preliminary study of the stabilization impacts of an
                        accelerated or increased national security program. I should like to place
                        before the members of the National Security Council some of the major
                        conclusions of this inquiry.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Course of Action</p>
                    <p>Some analysts of the defense program have felt that too much emphasis was
                        placed early in the program on building new facilities for the mobilization
                        base and too little in turning out new <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157"
                            facs="0187"/>weapons. The choice now is not between one or the other.
                        There is room now to make more rapid progress on both if the funds and
                        authority are made available.</p>
                    <p>In the field of military production, it may have been unavoidable that
                        original schedules fixed early in 1951 for certain key weapons could not be
                        met because of difficulties in organization of production, delays in
                        placement of contracts down through the subcontracting chain, material flow
                        difficulties and shortages, machine tool shortages, design difficulties,
                        testing delays, strikes, and so on. Hence, it made sense to revise schedules
                        to realistic levels and avoid the continued immobilizing of materials and
                        facilities that were out of phase.</p>
                    <p>But now, since many of these earlier problems have been solved or are well on
                        the way to solution, we are confronted by a new freedom of choice.</p>
                    <p>We could continue to live with the consequences of these past difficulties
                        and continue to extend the period of attaining these goals accordingly. By
                        so doing, we would content ourselves with getting back at a later date to
                        the levels of production earlier contemplated. We would thereby not attempt
                        to make up for lost time and past slippages either by (a) accelerating those
                        schedules or (b) by an over-all increase in these key programs for the
                        defense of the free world.</p>
                    <p>The other alternative is to take advantage of the solution of the earlier
                        difficulties which have been painfully overcome to carry out the objectives
                        toward which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/2 points. I strongly
                        urge that the acceleration of present schedules of key selected weapons is
                        not only feasible, but wise. Furthermore, in addition to such an
                        acceleration, I believe that a general expansion of our total programs
                        beginning in fiscal 1954 will also be feasible, to a very substantial
                        degree.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Material Availabilities</p>
                    <p>The feasibility of accelerating security programs is supported by a detailed
                        analysis of projected controlled materials (steel, copper, and aluminum)
                        supply and demand for calendar year 1953. This report shows that sufficient
                        materials will be available to permit considerably expanded security program
                        levels beginning in June 1953, even after allowing fully for all presently
                        planned security programs and unrestricted demand for consumption uses in
                        all other areas.</p>

                        mid-calendar year 1953, with the exception only of several special shapes
                        and alloys, steel availability should fully meet all requirements including
                        unrestricted market demand for all non-military uses. While estimates
                        regarding calendar year 1954 present the usual difficulties of
                        judgment-making for more remote periods of time, that period—as well as it
                        can be estimated at present—should present even greater availability against
                        projected unrestricted demands.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of demand to supply for <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> is
                        tight in 1953. Given an expected increase in the domestic production and
                        imports over first half calendar 1953 levels, sufficient copper should be
                        available to fulfill presently projected security programs, including an
                        assumed quarterly stockpile addition of 30, 000 tons (an arbitrary rate
                        having no official status), and permitting an approximate demand-supply
                        balance for all other consumption without use restrictions. It should be
                        noted that military programs other than small arms ammunition could be
                        increased substantially with only a relatively insignificant increase in
                        copper requirements.</p>
                    <p>The demand-supply relationship for <hi rend="italic">aluminum,</hi> assuming
                        no interruptible power loss and no stockpile additions, is expected to be in
                        approximate balance by the second calendar quarter of 1953. New facilities
                        should provide a rising surplus above projected direct defense requirements,
                        plus unrestricted market demand for all other uses, throughout the latter
                        half of calendar year 1953. Past experience indicates, however, that account
                        must be taken of potential losses of production because of power shortages
                        in the Northwest. In addition, of course, stockpile additions must be taken
                        into account. The DPA Deputy Administrator for Aluminum has suggested that
                        aluminum stockpile additions in the first half of calendar year 1953 be 100,
                        000 tons, and that the impact of any losses of production growing out of
                        potential power interruption fall upon this stockpile addition. This rate of
                        stockpiling would require approximately third quarter 1952 allotment
                        levels—which are relatively generous—to be maintained during the first and
                        second calendar quarters of 1953. Stockpiling at a level moderately less
                        than this in the last half of calendar 1953, however, would leave supplies
                        of aluminum above anticipated demands (on an unrestricted basis) in that
                        period.</p>
                    <p>The projected industrial and civilian demands utilized above reflect a
                        judgment that economic activity through 1953 will continue <pb
                            xml:id="pg_159" n="159" facs="0189"/>at the current high level, but that
                        no attempt to build inventories will take place comparable to that in the
                        post-Korean period. Total Gross National Product in 1951 dollars is expected
                        to rise moderately in 1953—perhaps by 5 or 6 per cent. By mid-1953 national
                        security expenditures under present programs are expected to be about 15 per
                        cent ($8 billion) above the current annual rate. Consumer spending on hard
                        goods is expected to be sustained. Total dollar expenditures for all types
                        of construction in 1953 are expected to remain at about the 1952 level.
                        While expenditures for new industrial plant and equipment related to
                        mobilization expansion will decline, with sharply-falling material
                        requirements, increases are anticipated in such other heavy construction
                        areas as petroleum and electric power. Relaxation of controls over
                        commercial and recreational construction will permit increased activity.
                        State and local governments will probably raise their expenditures for road
                        and bridge construction and other capital equipment.</p>
                    <p>No detailed examination of projected demand for major materials has been made
                        for calendar year 1954. Some increase in the production of aluminum and
                        copper may be contemplated as new expansion adds to supply; the supply level
                        for total steel products in CMP shapes and forms is anticipated to be about
                        equal to 1953 capacity. If material requirements continue into the year 1954
                        at the year-end-calendar 1953 rates, exclusive of stockpile additions for
                        copper and aluminum, the spread of supply over demand for aluminum will
                        widen in the calendar year 1954; the margins for steel and copper will
                        approximate those existing at the end of calendar 1953.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the demand-supply relationship for different shapes and forms
                        would show variation in relative tightness and in timing of demand-supply
                        balance. But in the aggregate, controlled materials for accelerated security
                        program use will become available in increasing amounts in the last half of
                        calendar year 1953 and 1954. The rapid expansion of our plant and equipment
                        in the past few years will add steadily to our ability to accelerate
                        security programs without adversely affecting the civilian sector of the
                        economy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative Choices Must be Made for Available
                        Materials</p>
                    <p>This outlook suggests the importance of appraising, at this time, future
                        alternative uses for the available materials. These alternatives include:
                        (a) increases in selected direct military and atomic energy programs; (b)
                        increased stockpiling over currently-projected levels for calendar year
                        1953; and (c) selective expansion through the entire range of our security
                        programs to strengthen deficiencies, fill gaps, and provide for changing
                        requirements in the production <pb xml:id="pg_160" n="160" facs="0190"/>and
                        resource base for full mobilization, both for ourselves and our allies.</p>
                    <p>Although the extent to which individual military and other security programs
                        could be expanded can be determined only after detailed review of specific
                        shape, alloy, facility and other requirements, materials should be available
                        to support any one or a combination of the following: substantial expansion
                        of the specific military programs, increased stockpiling of copper and
                        aluminum, building toward mobilization-readiness objectives in selected
                        resource and facility areas both at home and elsewhere in the free world,
                        and the direct provision of general economic aid to our allies in the form
                        of materials and production equipment. In any event, it is clear that
                        security programs could be increased beginning in the latter half of 1953
                        while at the same time permitting material availability sufficient to meet
                        unrestricted market demand, as nearly as that demand can be predicted at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Accelerating Military End-Item Production,
                        Stockpiling, and Foreign-Aid Programs</p>
                    <p>This review of material availabilities suggests that the acceleration of
                        output called for in paragraph 16 a of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        135/2 could cover a wide range of items. There are a number of candidate
                        programs, using that term in its broadest sense.</p>
                    <p>In the area of military end-item production, possibilities for acceleration
                        would seem to center in programs having such characteristics as the
                        following: they are of central importance in providing security; they cannot
                        be manufactured in a short time-period following an outbreak of war;
                        engineering has been completed or nearly completed on the item at the
                        present time; adequate facilities and raw materials are now available for
                        their production; plant capacity, including machine tools to produce the
                        item, is now available; and a sudden increased demand in the near future
                        would not result in a corresponding demand for extraordinary skills or long
                        apprenticeships.</p>
                    <p>The specific programs which might be chosen, of course, are intimately
                        related to strategic considerations which I do not presume to appraise.
                        Illustrative of the type of program items which fit the above criteria are
                        jet engines; airframes for fighters and bombers; certain electronics like
                        the Hydrogen Thystron tubes, transistors, the circuits to go with them, and
                        servo-mechanisms; large tools not used in civilian work such as heavy
                        presses and their attendant equipment, as well as large steel castings and
                        forgings; certain optics which require aging of the glass, and slow grinding
                        or ruling of the lenses or reflectors; and some types of guided
                        missiles.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_161" n="161" facs="0191"/>
                    <p>For some programs, short-lived bottlenecks would have to be overcome.
                        Choke-points might grow out of the need for additional manpower, more jigs
                        and fixtures, and perhaps even additions to plant capacity. None of these
                        problems is so difficult, however, that expediting action could not overcome
                        it quickly if decisions to accelerate or expand were to be taken now. In no
                        case has it been established that any material shortages would restrain such
                        an acceleration with the possible exception of a few very scarce materials
                        such as titanium. Such problems, however, are now in the process of being
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>In appraising the availability of materials for accelerating security
                        programs, in calendar year 1953 and beyond, the future rate of stockpiling
                        (which is an important phase of our security programs) must be taken into
                        account. Stockpile objectives for a number of critical materials, such as
                        copper and aluminum and the ferroalloys, have not been completed. The
                        materials outlook sketched above for the last half of calendar year 1953 and
                        extending into the year 1954 suggests that a substantial additional degree
                        of security could be acquired, after meeting other demands, both in security
                        end-item production and in stockpiling. How much of each is obtained
                        depends, of course, upon the degree of acceleration determined in each
                        case.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity open for accelerating military end-item production was noted
                        above. A correspondingly favorable possibility exits for stockpiling. For
                        example, the stockpile objective for copper is 1, 100, 000 tons against
                        which an inventory on June 30, 1952 of 565, 000 tons existed. If the goal
                        were to be achieved within the next few years, the quarterly additions of
                        copper to the stockpile would have to be above the arbitrary rate of 30, 000
                        tons mentioned above, as an assumption in making the demand-supply
                        projection for this metal. The aluminum inventory in the national stockpile
                        on June 30, 1952 amounted to 103, 000 tons against a stockpile objective of
                        2, 000, 000 tons. Obviously, here too, an approach to achieving stockpile
                        goals within the next few years would require higher quarterly additions
                        than the rates assumed above. The situation in other key materials is
                        similar.</p>
                    <p>A third major security program area is our aid to foreign friendly nations.
                        Increasing material availabilities will make possible further help in
                        controlled material shapes and forms (e.g., steel ingots), as well as
                        components and finished products, to strengthen their defense programs. In
                        this area a comparatively small utilization of our productive resources can
                        pay large dividends to our allies and to us.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Acceleration of Security Programs Not
                        Inflationary</p>
                    <p>Preliminary studies show that accelerated security program delivery rates
                        becoming effective about the middle of fiscal year 1954 (i.e., at the end of
                        calendar 1953) would probably not adversely affect the stabilization
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Some weakness in the economy may develop by the middle of next year. With the
                        approaching completion of the capacity expansion program, aggregate
                        investment is expected to decline. Although certain areas of investment will
                        remain high for some time, such as electric power and petroleum, the rate is
                        not likely to increase and therefore cannot serve to offset the decline in
                        other major expansion programs, such as steel. Nor will potential expansion
                        in other types of construction provide a sufficient offset.</p>
                    <p>By the third quarter of calendar 1953, moreover, expenditures for existing
                        major security programs will have reached their peak and will no longer
                        provide an inflationary impact on the economy. In fact, this maximum impact
                        will undoubtedly have been reached several months earlier. The point of
                        maximum drain of critical materials away from the civilian segment of the
                        economy for defense purposes has already been passed. The inflationary
                        pressures from the defense program, however, must be measured also in terms
                        of the employment of labor in the fabrication of raw materials into end
                        products. The peak inflationary impact, therefore, would precede the peak in
                        actual Treasury expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Trends toward weakness by mid-1953 may also develop from declines in
                        inventories and foreign investment. Manufacturing inventories for defense
                        contracts can be expected to recede as production bottlenecks are eliminated
                        and production reaches established schedules. Distribution inventories are
                        currently fairly well in balance with sales with the possible exception of
                        automobiles and a few other items, and it is doubtful that any substantial
                        expansion would be in prospect next year given the economic outlook above
                        outlined.</p>
                    <p>The only possible offset to these prospective weakening factors is a large
                        increase in consumption. This probably will not occur, however, without a
                        substantial downward price readjustment, which is not likely to develop
                        until production has fallen off substantially.</p>
                    <p>In appraising the possible stabilization impact of an acceleration or
                        expansion of our security programs, the timing as well as the rate and
                        magnitude must be considered. A program which called for an increase in
                        final deliveries of military goods as early as July 1, 1953 would require
                        that materials be committed for that program immediately. On the other hand,
                        if deliveries were not required <pb xml:id="pg_163" n="163" facs="0193"
                        />before the first quarter of calendar 1954, materials would not need to be
                        committed much before mid-1953.</p>
                    <p>An expansion of the defense program ranging from $6 to $12 billion (resulting
                        from acceleration or program increases, or both), if its actual impact is
                        felt no earlier than mid-1953, probably would create no serious inflationary
                        problem. Quite possibly this would be true as early as April 1, 1953.
                        Naturally there may be particular materials which at that time may still
                        remain in relatively short supply, but for the most part these would be
                        specialized types of industrial materials which do not have a wide use
                        throughout the economy.</p>
                    <p>I do not cite these dollar magnitudes as being my recommendation of the
                        extent to which security programs should be expanded. They are designed,
                        rather, to make the point that fairly sizeable additions to existing levels
                        of expenditures—ranging from 10 to 20 per cent—are not likely to be
                        inflationary if their actual impact comes after about mid-calendar year
                        1953. These dollar magnitudes, of course, refer to the total range of
                        security expenditures for all purposes—as broadly defined as they are in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/2. They include materials and
                        production equipment which might be part of an altered or expanded program
                        of aid to our allies and increased stockpiling, as well as strictly military
                        expenditures.</p>
                    <p>An increase of up to 10 to 12 per cent above existing programs, which would
                        mean $5 to $6 billion above the projected June 1953 annual level, I believe
                        could readily be absorbed without strain. If much beyond the maximum of $12
                        billion were involved, we would enter a situation in which the use of
                        control mechanisms might be increasingly necessary to overcome specific
                        materials shortages and an inflation problem. Our problems could be
                        accentuated also if the increase determined upon were concentrated in a
                        particular segment of the whole range of security programming; e.g., in a
                        few categories of military hard goods. I would, therefore, stress the
                        importance of early decisions on the possible magnitude of acceleration, and
                        the items involved, and on the extent and nature of an overall increase in
                        our programs.</p>
                    <p>I should like to add, too, that acceleration of existing programs fits into
                        our present and proposed abilities to manage our resources. A large future
                        increase in our security programs, following a period of moderate levels,
                        might find us shorn of our ability to exert that degree of direction over
                        the economy that would be required. The magnitude of that problem, of
                        course, would turn upon the timing and the level of such higher program.</p>

                        October 14, 1952</p>
                    <p>The only subject on the agenda was that of a Continental Early Warning
                        System. The President enjoined strict secrecy about what was discussed on
                        all those present.</p>
                    <p>There was a very large assemblage, including the Chiefs of Staff, Messrs.
                        Pace and <persName corresp="#p_FINLETTERTK1">Finletter</persName>, Messrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LOVETTRA1">Lovett</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FOSTERWC1">Foster</persName>, and a variety of Generals and
                        Admirals from the Department of Defense as well as a scattering from other
                        agencies of Government, including Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HARRIMANWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName>
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>, Jerry Wadsworth of Civilian
                        Defense, John Snyder, and, representing State, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Paul Nitze</persName> and myself.</p>
                    <p>In the estimation of the <persName corresp="#p_LINCOLNCGA1"
                            >Lincoln</persName> Summer School Project experts, their development has
                        reached a stage where they think it would be feasible to establish warning
                        stations.</p>
                    <p>An Air Force General presented the results of the Air Force study of this
                        program, aided by appropriate charts. He was also spokesman for the
                        Department of Defense in outlining that Department’s position. Its position
                        was that this new invention should be encouraged and that four experimental
                        stations should be equipped and manned. However, the Department of Defense
                        did not favor the crash implementation of the scheme, which is what was
                        advocated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GORRIEJ1">Gorrie</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">See the attachment to the memorandum by the
                            Secretary of State, Sept. 24, <ref target="#pg_141">p. 141</ref>.</note>
                        and by some of the scientists present. The Department of Defense favored a
                        somewhat slow expansion of funds to be devoted to this purpose with the idea
                        that this development would be pressed in step with the other dispositions
                        now being made by the Department of Defense in other fields of advance
                        warning.</p>
                    <p>The President closed the meeting by saying that he would like the Department
                        of Defense and the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> to get together and
                        make a recommendation to him.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_165" n="165" facs="0195"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Nitze</persName> asked a couple of
                        questions and I asked one myself designed to produce more information as to
                        why it would not be wiser to proceed on a crash implementation basis.</p>
                    <p>The real point at issue seems to me to be whether an overriding priority
                        should not be given by the Department of Defense to this proposal instead of
                        allocating to it a fairly minor sum almost on the theory of a convoy’s speed
                        being determined by the speed of its slowest ship.</p>
                    <p>I spoke to the President for a minute or two after the meeting on the above
                        basis and he said he would take this under consideration.</p>

                        time of war should be:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To reduce the power and influence of the USSR to limits which no
                            longer constitute a threat to the peace, national independence and
                            stability of the world family of nations.</item>
                        <item>b. To bring about a basic change in the conduct of international
                            relations by the government in power in Russia, to conform with the
                            purposes and principles set forth in the UN Charter.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In pursuing these objectives due care must be taken to avoid permanently
                        impairing our economy and the fundamental values and institutions inherent
                        in our way of life.</p>

                    <p>1. The objectives of the military program are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Protection against disaster; and</item>
                        <item>b. Support of our foreign policy.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the course of meeting these objectives, the military program is designed
                        to provide, at the least possible cost in manpower and national resources, a
                        maximum deterrent to enemy aggression and, in case war occurs, give the
                        nation a reasonable assurance of victory.</p>
                    <p>2. In order to attain the above objectives, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                        recommended the forces listed herein to carry out on an austere basis the
                        following approved basic military tasks:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To provide a reasonable initial defense of the Western Hemisphere
                            and essential allied areas, particularly in Europe.</item>
                        <item>b. To provide a minimum mobilization base while offensive forces are
                            being developed.</item>
                        <item>c. To conduct initial air and sea offensive operations to destroy
                            vital elements of the Soviet war-making capacity and to check <pb
                                xml:id="pg_167" n="167" facs="0197"/>enemy offensive operations
                            until allied offensive strength can be developed.</item>
                        <item>d. To defend and maintain the lines of communications and base areas
                            necessary to the execution of the above tasks.</item>
                        <item>e. To provide aid to our allies to assist them in the execution of
                            their responsibilities.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Military Program—Capability on June 30, 1952 to Fulfil its Objectives</p>
                    <p>The Army is currently capable of providing, on an austere basis, ground and
                        anti-aircraft defenses for certain of the most critical areas in the Western
                        Hemisphere and the essential overseas bases and lines of communication,
                        except those in the Benelux countries, France and Germany. It does not
                        possess the capability to fulfill the aggregate of the objectives set forth
                        because of the insufficient level of stocks in the mobilization reserve and
                        an inadequate industrial mobilization base and the inadequate strength and
                        readiness of the General Reserve.</p>
                    <p>The current Navy and Marine Corps capability to fulfill the outlined
                        objectives is good from the standpoint of being able to initiate D–Day
                        tasks. From the standpoint of sustaining and expanding the initial effort in
                        phase with current war plans, the capability is not good. The capability to
                        initiate D–Day tasks will improve as funds already approved are effectively
                        applied to improve the modernization and training of the active forces. The
                        capability to sustain and expand the initial effort will remain
                        unsatisfactory until funds are made available to increase significantly the
                        level of equipment in the mobilization reserve.</p>
                    <p>The Air Force has currently a limited capability to defend the Western
                        Hemisphere against air attack, owing chiefly to a shortage of all-weather
                        jet interceptors and delay in the completion of the radar network covering
                            Canada,<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">Documentation on negotiations and
                            discussions leading to joint US–Canadian construction of an early

                        Alaska and the northeastern United States. Assuming continued involvement in
                        Korea following the onset of general war, it would have difficulty in
                        carrying out those measures for the defense and maintenance of essential
                        lines of communication to Europe which fall within its responsibilities, and
                        could provide only a limited portion of its planned contribution to the
                        defense of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Far East. It has
                        also a limited capability to carry out the strategic offensive. These
                        capabilities will continue to improve as manpower and resources continue to
                        be made available for the build-up and modernization of the Air Force in
                        accordance with approved goals. The position of the Air Force <pb
                            xml:id="pg_168" n="168" facs="0198"/>with respect to post D–Day
                        mobilization and capability to sustain and expand the initial effort is
                        serious. It has been necessary for the Air Force to expend a maximum of
                        available resources for the force in-being at the expense of the
                        mobilization potential. The ability of the Air Force to sustain certain of
                        its D–Day tasks will continue to be less than satisfactory until the
                        mobilization reserve position has been significantly improved.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Military Program—Air Defense</p>
                    <p>At present, the 3–6 hour warning of an impending air attack on the
                        continental U.S. essential for both military and civil defense is not
                        assured. Intelligence may fail, and the present warning systems in Alaska,
                        Canada, and Newfoundland can be avoided—through gaps in coverage, by
                        low-level attacks or by submarine-launched missiles. A raid might not be
                        detected until well within the continental U.S. defense system.</p>
                    <p>The capabilities of air defense forces are extremely meager, especially
                        against low altitude and night attacks. The following need improvement:
                        early warning, land radar cover at low altitude, seaward radar coverage at
                        all altitudes, capacity of present systems to handle large raids,
                        identification of surprise attacks, quality and quantity of all-weather
                        interceptors, and AA against very high and very low attacks.</p>
                    <p>Present forces for the air defense of the U.S. and Canada include 46
                        interceptor squadrons, 45 AA battalions, 80 large radars and 11 air defense
                        control centers. Additional radar sites are under construction.</p>
                    <p>Programmed and funded improvements include 60 early warning and control
                        aircraft to man 8 off-shore stations; 57 all-weather fighter squadrons
                        totaling 1425 aircraft; 9 RCAF all-weather fighter squadrons totaling 172
                        aircraft; and 66 AA battalions, 28 of which are to be equipped with Nike
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>Additional improvements planned, but not yet funded include 35 more large
                        radars to fill gaps in the perimeter; some small radars for low altitude
                        protection; sea-based radar coverage in critical coastal sea areas; better
                        data-handling systems, identification, fighter interceptors, and local
                        defense; and development generally for additional early warning and defense
                        in depth.</p>
                    <p>Two recent technological break-throughs make the extension of the early
                        warning system northward beyond the boundaries of the United States
                        technically and economically feasible. First, the development of audible
                        means for presenting radar information eliminates the problem of manning and
                        watching radar scopes under Arctic conditions. Secondly, the discovery that
                        long-range radio communications are possible at frequencies much higher <pb

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Air Defense.</hi> The three major components of air
                        defense are warning systems, surface weapons, and air weapons. Present
                        warning and control systems have three major weaknesses: (1) the ranges of
                        surveillance radars do not provide sufficient warning for interceptor
                        aircraft; (2) present radars have difficulty detecting aircraft at very low
                        altitudes or at very high altitudes; (3) the radar systems are easily
                        saturated; that is, the number of aircraft that can be detected, tracked and
                        taken under attack simultaneously by present warning and control networks is
                        altogether too small. Major improvement cannot be expected for four or five
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Present anti-aircraft gun systems are ineffective above 20, 000 feet and at
                        very low altitudes. Extremely rapid firing rocket systems, to be available
                        in next three to five years, should improve capabilities for countering very
                        low level attacks. Major improvement of anti-aircraft defense will begin to
                        be realized in approximately 2 years with the advent of surface launched
                        guided missiles in significant numbers. These promise anti-aircraft ranges
                        of 10 to 25 miles <pb xml:id="pg_170" n="170" facs="0200"/>at altitudes up
                        to 60, 000 feet, with high probability of kills in one or two shots.</p>
                    <p>Regarding air weapons, our jet fighters should be effective against present
                        Russian heavy bombers if alerted and directed to the target in time. Between
                        1957 and 1960 our interceptors should become armed with guided missiles and
                        should be susceptible of control, in any kind of weather, from the ground or
                        from aircraft carriers. During this same period, ground-to-air guided
                        missiles, completely controlled from ground stations at ranges of 100 to 250
                        miles, should begin to be available.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Anti-Submarine and Anti-Mine Warfare.</hi> The problems
                        of detecting distant objects under water and properly classifying them are
                        both extremely difficult and especially critical to our success. Our ability
                        to deal with modern submarines, once detected, also leaves much to be
                        desired, but weapons now under development are expected to provide
                        substantial improvement in the next 2 to 3 years. The use of atomic weapons
                        to destroy submarines at sea may become economically feasible.</p>
                    <p>The best technique today for detecting fully submerged submarines is “sonar,”
                        a system based upon sound signals transmitted through the water. The present
                        average range of sonar detection can be approximately doubled by towing the
                        sonar gear some distance below the ship or by suspending it from a
                        helicopter or blimp. Such techniques will be operational in 1955. Ranges up
                        to 5 miles may be achieved by 1956. An important program is now underway to
                        exploit the discovery that the very low frequency sounds given off by
                        snorkelling or surfaced submarines can be heard at great distances in the
                        water. Large listening arrays can provide submarine surveillance by this
                        technique known as “lofar”, at distances considerably in excess of 100
                        miles.</p>
                    <p>Our present capability against mines is dangerously low, especially in the
                        case of pressure, magnetic and acoustic mines laid on harbor and channel
                        bottoms. No completely adequate means to detect and classify bottom-laid
                        mines are in prospect. For this reason we are developing sweeping equipment
                        that will itself explode the mines, thereby removing the need for detecting
                        and classifying them. Despite our best ingenuity, however, anti-mine warfare
                        is expected to remain a slow, costly, and extremely dangerous operation.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">General Air Warfare.</hi> The most significant weapons
                        advance in this field is the development of small atomic bombs that can be
                        carried by fighters, fighter bombers, light bombers and general purpose
                        aircraft operating from forward airfields and aircraft carriers. These
                        smaller bombs are beginning to be stockpiled this year. To <pb
                            xml:id="pg_171" n="171" facs="0201"/>carry the small atomic bomb several
                        currently operational fighters and light attack aircraft are being
                        modified.</p>
                    <p>Dive-bombing is an accurate delivery technique, but if an atomic weapon is
                        used, ceilings as high as 18, 000 feet are normally required so that release
                        can be made at an altitude which permits the aircraft to escape damage.
                        However, one experimental method, expected to be operational by 1953, would
                        allow a fighter to approach the target at treetop height and release its
                        bomb in a sharp climbing maneuver, lobbing the bomb several miles to the
                        target.</p>
                    <p>In the field of guided missiles, two subsonic turbo-jet guided missiles may
                        assist in penetrating enemy defenses. Each is designed to carry the atomic
                        bomb to maximum ranges of 500 miles, Matador from land bases and Regulus
                        from submarines, surface ships or land bases. Both are now in limited
                        production for test purposes, but may be operational in 2 to 5 years.</p>
                    <p>Air bases and aircraft carriers must be considered prime targets in an
                        enemy’s efforts to reduce our air capabilities. To decrease the
                        vulnerability of land bases to air attack, reduction in their size would be
                        highly desirable. To this end, work is being done on the “zero length
                        launcher”: a technique of rocket-assisted launching that eliminates the
                        normal take-off run. The British have developed a corrolary technique of
                        landing fighters without wheels on a pneumatic mat. This is being further
                        investigated for application to larger aircraft and may lead to an
                        increasing capability to operate from very small areas.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Ground Combat.</hi> The development of tactical atomic
                        weapons will undoubtedly have the most profound implications for land
                        warfare, although the ultimate impact cannot yet be accurately foreseen. A
                        ground-fired atomic weapon will be available for service in 1953. A large
                        unguided rocket with an atomic warhead will be operationally available in
                        significant numbers in 1954. Also in 1954, a shortrange, surface launched
                        rocket-type guided missile with a range of about 75 miles, carrying an
                        atomic warhead will become operational. Similar missiles with ranges up to
                        150 miles will follow.</p>
                    <p>By 1954, full scale offensive capability for the nerve gas GB is expected. A
                        new light and mobile anti-tank vehicle with sufficient armor to protect its
                        crew against the weapons of an enemy infantry screen and armed with
                        recoilless rifles capable of destroying any known enemy tank will become
                        available in 1954.</p>
                    <p>A problem of great urgency concerns our night-time capabilities for
                        surveillance, detection, ranging, and fire control. Full solution is several
                        years away. Another serious problem, for which solution is very remote,
                        concerns our ability to detect non-metallic land mines.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_172" n="172" facs="0202"/>
                    <p>Improvement in supply and transport techniques is steady. The availability of
                        large powerful helicopters has already enhanced our capability for rapidly
                        delivering groups of fully equipped men ready for immediate combat into
                        areas where other aircraft cannot land. About 1957, a helicopter able to
                        carry 18 men will be available.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Strategic Air Operations.</hi> Strategic air operations
                        involve three primary problems: (1) penetration of enemy defenses; (2)
                        location of the target and accurate delivery of the bomb; and (3) the
                        ability to accomplish the foregoing in all kinds of weather.</p>
                    <p>The application of supplementary jet engines to the B–36 gives it higher
                        speeds for short periods and thus improves its prospects of successful
                        penetration. The all-jet B–47, to be fully operational in 1953, represents
                        the next step in aircraft development and will have a combat speed of 540
                        miles per hour. However, because of its lesser range, it must operate from
                        advance bases or be refueled in the air in order to reach many of the
                        probable target areas. The B–52 and B–60, which will come into operational
                        use about 1956, promise very long ranges without refueling and at a speed of
                        600 miles per hour.</p>
                    <p>Two new bombers will soon enter development. Test flights are scheduled for
                        1956 and production may be possible in 1958. One is designed to fly at a
                        speed just below that of sound and at altitudes below 1000 feet. The other
                        is designed for operation at high altitudes at combat speeds approaching
                        1250 miles per hour, far above the speed of sound. Refueling of both in the
                        air will be necessary for long-range missions.</p>
                    <p>Also under consideration as a penetration technique is the “parasite” system
                        in which a small aircraft proceeds to the target after being carried to the
                        combat zone by a larger, slower, long-range aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Guided missiles may be the ultimate answer to the penetration problem. A
                        subsonic surface-launched guided missile capable of carrying an atomic
                        warhead to intercontinental ranges will be tested in 2 or 3 years and may be
                        operational within six years. Proceeding on about the same time scale is a
                        supersonic missile, also with an atomic warhead, to be launched from a large
                        bomber that will carry it to within about 100 miles of the target. Missiles
                        with several times the speed of sound and with intercontinental ranges may
                        become operational several years later.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In military procurement, a slow but steady increase in deliveries has taken
                        place (see the following chart).<note n="6" xml:id="d32fn6">Not
                            printed.</note> By September 30, 1952, total deliveries since Korea
                        reached $41 billion, about one-third of the $129 billion financed through
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. Current deliveries are running
                        about $8 billion per quarter. The recent stoppage in the steel industry has
                        caused some losses of military production—part of which will be made up—and
                        may cause additional losses in the coming months despite preventive action.
                        Current aircraft production is running about 900 planes per month, a
                        post-Korea high, but somewhat under the latest approved schedule. Medium
                        tank production reached 535 units in September, many times the rate of a
                        year ago. It is expected to rise to a monthly average of over 800 in the
                        April–June quarter of 1953, a quantity sufficient to provide for immediate
                        demand. Since succeeding production will provide for accumulation of
                        mobilization reserves, a stretch-out of the medium tank schedule will
                        follow.</p>
                    <p>On September 30, expansion goals had been set for 176 products and materials.
                        The primary tool to achieve these goals has been accelerated tax
                        amortization, with most projects so aided due to be completed by December,
                        1953. The programs for aluminum, electric power, steel, and petroleum
                        refining are shown graphically in a separate chart.<note n="6"

                        way to increase supplies by 1955 of such stockpiled items as copper, lead,
                        zinc, nickel, tungsten, and cobalt.</p>
                    <p>Allocation operations met defense needs for all major materials during <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952. There was scarcity, therefore, only in
                        the sense that civilian and export needs were trimmed and industrial usage
                            <pb xml:id="pg_174" n="174" facs="0204"/>reduced, or that stockpile
                        accumulations fell behind. By the summer of 1953, except for several special
                        shapes and alloys, enough steel should be available to satisfy unrestricted
                        demand. However, since the supply of copper and, to a lesser extent,
                        aluminum will not reach comfortable proportions until the latter half of
                        1953, the framework of the Controlled Materials Plan will be required at
                        least until mid-1953. The advisability of removing most controls by that
                        time is under study.</p>
                    <p>Because of uncertainty as to the dimensions of the mobilization base, fresh
                        appraisals of the nation’s present and proposed production distributive
                        capacity were initiated in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952. Action in
                        this area must wait completion of these and other studies and agreement on
                        proposals to remedy deficiencies. The Department of Defense has, however,
                        already taken the step of including in its 1954 budget request a separate
                        fund for the procurement of production equipment for reserve production
                        capacity.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 was a year of remarkable general

                        rated low because of equipment deficiencies. Considerable expansion of air
                        forces was planned. Tripartite economic aid to Yugoslavia allowed minimum

                        enlarged. The $62.5 million Spanish loan had been almost entirely committed,

                        deficiencies. Iranian forces, designed chiefly for internal security, met

                        critical economic conditions in the rest of the Near East and Africa,
                        economic aid was directed at Arab refugees, neutralism, and Israeli economic

                        depending upon the degree of warning and preparation.</p>
                    <p>If an attack had occurred on June 30, the Federal Civil Defense
                        Administration would have had a measure of functional capability, but the
                        nation-wide civil defense organization would have been grossly inadequate.
                        The public would not have been mentally or emotionally prepared. The warning
                        system was 20% operational. Shelter would have been less than 10% adequate.
                        Radio and television stations would have left the air, thus depriving the
                        people of the means of guidance. Medical supplies, mass feeding facilities
                        and emergency lodging, traffic control, rescue service, water supplies for
                        fire-fighting, and organized transportation would all have been
                        ineffective.</p>
                    <p>In terms of personnel, civil defense had 3.3 million persons organized, about
                        18% of the 17.5 million required. Even this is an overstatement of personnel
                        readiness, since those enrolled were not properly distributed. The number
                        enrolled was relatively high for regular community services like
                        fire-fighting and police, but low for activities peculiar to civil defense

                    </p>
                    <p>Estimated wartime requirements for many materials could be met by domestic
                        production and available imports, but 75 are now stockpiled to cover
                        calculated deficits,</p>
                    <p>Recently the Interdepartmental Stockpiling Committee put all stockpile
                        materials in 5 bands on the basis of urgency. They found metals to be the
                        most critical, and put 6—beryl, cobalt, columbite, nickel, tantalite and
                        tungsten—in Band I (most urgent).</p>
                    <p>The percent-of-wartime-requirements approach used for the individual
                        stockpile items is the best one for measuring the status of the program.
                        This is shown in the following chart. But other measures may be used for
                        operational purposes. The second chart,<note n="13" xml:id="d32fn13">Neither
                            chart printed.</note> marked “Rate of Acquisition”, plots the growth of
                        the stockpile as a whole. On June 30, 1951, 36% of the total stockpile goal,
                        figures in then current prices, was on hand. Since then some individual
                        objectives have been changed and prices have fluctuated; but on August 31,
                        1952, 51% of the total stockpile goal, figured in current prices, was on
                        hand. At this rate of growth, it would be at least 3 years, and possibly 6
                        or more, before the stockpile is completed. Schedules, however, now call for
                        an increase in this rate. Most individual stockpiles grew more slowly during
                        the past year or so <pb xml:id="pg_178" n="178" facs="0208"/>than was
                        planned. Inventories of 2 declined: chemical grade chromite and
                        corundum.</p>
                    <p>This slow progress resulted from priority given to current military
                        production, and to certain civilian production necessary to maintain
                        employment and a healthy civilian economy. These prior claims have meant the
                        diversion of goods scheduled for stockpile acquisition and, in some cases,
                        even withdrawals from the stockpile.</p>
                    <p>On August 31 the stockpile was valued at $3.7 billion in current prices, but
                        the Government had paid for it (at various earlier dates) only $2.3
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>The stockpile program is based on the wartime needs of the United States
                        alone. There has been no effort to dovetail our stockpiling program and
                        those of our allies into a single program. However, the U.S. does attempt to
                        work out current demand and supply of scarce materials with other free
                        nations through the International Materials Conference.</p>

                    <p>While an agreed over-all strategic concept for the program had not been
                        formulated, certain broad criteria for establishing relative priorities were
                        agreed. Some progress was made in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        areas, but deterioration took place elsewhere, particularly in the Near
                        East. The made-in-America character of part of our psychological output was
                        a major handicap. Even worse was the increasing reaction, expressed in
                        neutralism and charges of U.S. aggressiveness, to the military character of
                        some of our political and economic activities. In underdeveloped countries,
                        past or present white domination is a far greater psychological reality than
                        the Soviet menace. In <pb xml:id="pg_179" n="179" facs="0209"/>other areas,
                        particularly Western Europe, the over-riding abhorrence of another possible
                        war constitutes an important liability.</p>
                    <p>Certain U.S. policies are psychologically damaging. In the Moslem world, it
                        is U.S. policy toward Israel. In areas under European domination, it is U.S.
                        identification with its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. In
                        Britain and elsewhere, it is U.S. policy toward China. The same is true of
                        certain primarily domestic matters: race relations; the restrictive
                        immigration policy, most recently embodied in the McCarran Act; and tariff
                        laws.</p>

                        will contribute to the improvement of security through the development of a
                        common procedure in all sensitive governmental units. Control of persons is
                        weak in the entry-exit area, despite limited measures taken regarding the
                        entry of potentially dangerous aliens and new authority under the recent
                        Omnibus Immigration Act. There are no adequate controls over alien crewmen,
                        or foreign official and diplomatic personnel.</p>
                    <p>There is a high degree of installation security for certain government
                        buildings and areas of some sensitive agencies. Uniform standards for
                        industrial facilities are being prepared by the Facilities Protection Board
                        for publication in December, 1952. A substantial number of key facilities
                        have been assigned by the Industries Evaluation Board to government agencies
                        for security supervision, and a great many others are under review. There is
                        virtually no control over the subcontracting plants of classified
                        contractors. Furthermore, legal authority is lacking to remove security
                        risks in industry, there is difficulty in preventing strikes by
                        communist-infiltrated unions, and plant visitors are not adequately checked.
                        Accordingly, the U.S. industrial establishment is not secure, and acts of
                        sabotage should come as no surprise,</p>
                    <p>Difficulties in implementing the limited port security program reduce its
                        effectiveness, even in major ports. No effective security program was in
                        force for the communications industry. Export licensing <pb xml:id="pg_181"

                        problems of transshipment abroad and diplomatic immunity; import control has
                        been identified as a counter-smuggling problem, and is being treated
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Present safeguards against clandestine unconventional attack provide little
                        security—whether in the area of port security, atomic material, use of the
                        mails, air traffic, or diplomatic shipments.</p>
                    <p>The “minimum standards” executive order provides the basis for safeguarding
                        classified information, but the program for personnel clearance for access
                        thereto awaits another executive order, as well as decision with respect to

                        submitted to the National Security Council a three-volume study entitled
                        “Current Policies of the Government of the United States of America Relating
                        to National Security”. In a covering memorandum, <persName

                        assembled for the information of the President and the President-elect in

                        Policies; Volume III, Organizational Policies. In Volume I, each section
                        normally contained three parts for each geographic area, a Central
                        Intelligence Agency intelligence estimate, a current statement of policy,
                        and a summary of principal developments in the implementation of policy,
                        prepared by the responsible departments or agencies in each case. Volumes II
                        and III contained only the second and third parts for each section. Texts of

                        Council reports and memoranda. The source of each policy statement, the date

                        the United States, our ability to recover from the attack would be
                        destroyed. In a few years the Soviet Union will have enough atomic bombs and
                        the means to deliver them to launch such an attack.</p>
                    <p>To prevent a national tragedy of this sort, it is clear that the United
                        States must develop a combined system of air defense and civil defense. One
                        of the prime factors in this defense is early warning of the coming of enemy
                        planes. Without an early warning the loss of civilian life from a saturation
                        atomic raid would be staggering, with consequent loss to national morale and
                        capacity for carrying on a war. Early warning is essential also for military
                        purposes to preserve our retaliatory capacity and put our defensive forces
                        into action. Furthermore, early warning is essential for the success of
                        joint civilian-military actions such as a civil defense program, industrial
                        security program, stockpiling, and navigational counter measures designed to
                        prevent the enemy from homing on prime targets.</p>
                    <p>Our current warning capabilities are inadequate.<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4"

                                target="#d9fn2">footnote 2</ref>, p. 20.</note> states in its report
                        of June 26, 1952 that “There are no serious technical obstacles to prevent
                        us from detecting a Soviet airborne attack soon after the airplanes leave
                        their own bases.” It recommended that the Department of Defense undertake to
                        provide for detection of an enemy airborne attack at a distance not less
                        than 2, 000 miles from the continental limits of the United States with
                        resulting early warnings.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of new technical developments, it is estimated that $250,
                        000, 000 per year would be sufficient to support an early warning system,
                        that is, to provide for initial procurement and installation; to maintain
                        and operate stations after they are installed; to extend the system
                        progressively; and to permit a continual improvement program based on
                        general technological advances in electronics and related fields. It is
                        estimated that such an early warning system could possibly be in operation
                        within two years if the initial funds for this purpose were made available
                        immediately, and the necessary priorities and continuing support were given
                        to the project.</p>
                    <p>An early warning system obviously is not the only element in a program
                        necessary for the protection of the United States against atomic attack.
                        Many other elements such as interceptors and guided missile defenses are
                        also essential, as well as the military measures precedent to a manageable
                        civil defense recommended by the East River Project. But while these other
                        elements are being developed we should proceed rapidly with the
                        establishment of an early warning system, which is the <hi rend="italic"
                            >sine qua non</hi> of any program for the protection of the United
                        States and which has significant effectiveness in itself.</p>
                    <p>The inadequacy of military measures precedent to a manageable civil defense
                        and of our civil defense system, including early warning, constitute a
                        startling weakness in our national defense at the present time. The Civil
                        Defense Administration and the National Security Resources Board are unable
                        adequately to plan their activities. Our civilians and our industrial
                        establishment would suffer terrible losses as a consequence of enemy atomic
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, an effective system of national defense would be a
                        powerful deterrent to war; the enemy would be reluctant to strike if its
                        blows would not be effective against us. Furthermore, an adequate defense
                        would increase tremendously our security, add to our power position with
                        respect to the Soviet Union, and give us a sounder base for speaking with
                        assurance in international affairs.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. That the Department of Defense be assigned responsibility to install and
                        have operational an early warning system capable of giving three to six
                        hours warning of hostile aircraft approaching the United States; that a
                        target date of December 31, 1954 be set for the accomplishment of this
                        mission; that all agencies and departments be directed to give full support
                        to the Department of Defense as requested by it in accomplishing this
                        mission; that $20, 000, 000 be made available immediately out of 1953
                        obligational authority; that additional amounts up to an aggregate of $100,
                        000, 000 out of 1953 funds be made available as additional elements of the
                        program are worked out.</p>
                    <p>[2. That planning for and research and development work in connection with an
                        air defense program proceed on the assumption that an early warning system
                        will be operational in two years; and that progressively increasing
                        effectiveness of the U.S. air defense capability is required.</p>
                    <p>3. That the Civil Defense Administration and the National Security Resources
                        Board proceed in their planning on the assumptions that (a) the early
                        warning system will be operational in two years, and (b) the air defense
                        system will increase progressively in effectiveness from 25 percent in 1955
                        to 75 percent by the end of 1957.]<note n="6" xml:id="d34fn6">Brackets in

                        security posture in 1954 and the immediately following period on the basis

                        programs; (3) An analysis of the possibilities of undertaking these further
                        programs by a reallocation of the planned present programs, as against the

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. For the time being the worldwide Communist expansion has apparently been
                        checked. There are indications that the USSR has recognized this situation
                        and has been shifting to less openly aggressive tactics. Since Korea the
                        Soviet bloc has undertaken no new military adventures and it has not
                        increased its aid to Communist insurrectionary movements during the last
                        year. These changes are due in great part to the fact that the principal
                        Western countries have grown politically, economically, and militarily
                        stronger.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_187" n="187" facs="0217"/>
                    <p>2. While the formerly widespread fear of imminent global war has notably
                        lessened, the Soviet leaders have not moderated their hostility toward the
                        free world. No general settlement between the Bloc and the free world is in
                        prospect, nor any substantial Soviet concessions. No new indications of
                        weakness have appeared in the Soviet Bloc; on the contrary it grows
                        stronger. The Kremlin continues to expect an ultimate victory over the
                        capitalist world.</p>
                    <p>3. We believe that the outlook is for a continuation of Soviet efforts to
                        undermine and destroy the non-Communist world by cold war tactics. The
                        Communists will resort to armed aggression and to armed revolt by indigenous
                        Communist parties when they believe these courses of action are the best
                        means to achieve Communist objectives. If the growth of free world strength
                        and unity continues, however, the Communists will probably place greater
                        emphasis upon “united front” tactics and upon propaganda and diplomatic
                        moves designed to split the Western allies and to promote dissension within
                        non-Soviet countries.</p>
                    <p>4. Thus, great danger to the free world during the period of this estimate
                        will lie in political and economic difficulties and divisions within the
                        free world itself which would check the development of free world unity and
                        strength and lend themselves to Communist exploitation.</p>
                    <p>5. We believe it unlikely that the Kremlin will deliberately initiate general
                        war during the period of this estimate. However, there will be continuing
                        grave danger that general war may arise from a series of actions and
                        counteractions in a situation which neither side desired to develop into
                        general war.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="strong">I. The Strengths and Weaknesses of the Soviet Bloc</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Political</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviet regime is firmly entrenched in power, and there is no apparent
                        prospect of its control being threatened or shaken. Internal stresses and
                        strains appear less serious now than ever before. Such rivalries and policy
                        disagreements as may exist are unlikely to affect the unity and resolution
                        of the regime.</p>
                    <p>7. Soviet control over the European Satellites, now virtually complete, will
                        probably be maintained through the skillful and experienced use of military
                        and police power and through political and economic controls. The popular
                        discontent now present will persist <pb xml:id="pg_188" n="188" facs="0218"
                        />and perhaps increase, but will probably not develop into more than a minor
                        impediment to the Soviet program.</p>
                    <p>8. The Chinese Communist regime has firm control over mainland China, and
                        there is little likelihood of this control being threatened by domestic
                        forces. Unlike the European Satellites, Communist China is not directly and
                        completely controlled by the Kremlin. The Chinese Communists have retained
                        some capacity for independent action and for influencing the shaping of
                        Communist policy in the Far East. Both the Chinese and Soviet leaders
                        apparently view their present relationship as advantageous, and appear to
                        recognize that neither side can substantially change the nature of their
                        relations—by the USSR attempting to establish complete domination over
                        China, or by Communist China asserting complete independence of the
                        USSR—without jeopardizing the attainment of its own objectives.</p>
                    <p>9. Outside the Bloc, the Communists’ political strength derives mainly from
                        the international Communist movement, the appeal of Communist doctrine, and
                        the power and size of the Bloc itself. Bloc size and strength generate fear
                        and defeatism, especially among those unable to defend themselves. Communist
                        doctrine is used both as an inspiration to the faithful and an appeal to the
                        frustrated. Through the international Communist movement and through front
                        organizations under its control, the Soviet leaders are able to exploit
                        weaknesses and divisions throughout the non-Soviet world in the furtherance
                        of Communist objectives.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Military</p>
                    <p>10. Soviet Bloc military strength, already formidable, will continue to
                        increase. The modernization program in the Soviet military services will
                        continue. Special emphasis will continue to be placed on weapons of mass
                        destruction and upon defense against such weapons. By mid-1955, the USSR
                        will probably have about 300 atomic bombs (30–100 Kiloton yield);<note n="‡"
                            xml:id="d37fn-sym7">The actual figure may be from one half to twice as
                            great as the figure given. This estimate is currently under review.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> it may have a thermonuclear
                        weapon; it will have developed improved methods for delivering these weapons
                        against the U.S. and its allies. Soviet air defenses, already substantial,
                        will probably further improve.</p>
                    <p>11. In the European Satellites and in Communist China, programs for the
                        improvement of military strength are also going forward. In the Satellites,
                        the emphasis is on expansion and equipment of conventional forces and will
                        result in a substantial addition to Soviet military strength in Europe,
                        offsetting, at least in part, the growth of Western strength. In Communist
                        China, emphasis <pb xml:id="pg_189" n="189" facs="0219"/>is on re-equipping
                        existing forces, and their combat effectiveness is likely to increase.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Economic</p>
                    <p>12. We estimate that by 1951 the gross national product of the USSR was 20 to
                        30 percent above the prewar level, and that it is now increasing at an
                        annual rate of 6 to 7 percent. Soviet production constitutes about 60
                        percent of the total production of the Bloc, including Communist China. In
                        1951 the combined gross national product of all Bloc countries was less than
                        one-third that of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, and the
                        Soviet gross national product was about one-fourth that of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>13. Since the end of World War II, the Bloc as a whole has devoted a much
                        larger proportion of its gross national product to military purposes than
                        the West. We believe that the USSR now devotes about one-fifth of its
                        national product to military expenditures. Traditionally low living
                        standards and the controls prevailing within the Bloc enable the Bloc states
                        consistently to assign to military purposes a much larger proportion of
                        total output, particularly of scarce materials and goods, than is feasible
                        in Western countries. Furthermore, the Bloc is able to assign a higher
                        proportion of its military outlay to actual munitions production than is
                        done in the West.</p>
                    <p>14. The Soviet economy is organized with a view to possible hostilities in
                        the near future as well as in the more remote future. These two objectives
                        compete to some extent in the allocation of resources. The Kremlin places a
                        high priority upon stockpiling reserves, not only of military end items but

                        under wartime conditions or other emergencies.</p>
                    <p>15. The Bloc could increase its exports to the non-Communist world within the
                        period of this estimate. We estimate that even a slight increase of trade
                        with the non-Communist world would constitute an important political warfare
                        weapon and might obtain for the Bloc some critical equipment and materials
                        now difficult or impossible for it to obtain.</p>
                    <p>16. The USSR is engaged in a large-scale research and development program.
                        This includes both pure and applied research, with an emphasis upon applied
                        research in fields of military application, especially atomic energy,
                        electronics, jet aircraft, guided missiles, and submarines. In all of these
                        fields, Soviet scientists and technicians have demonstrated a high level of
                        proficiency.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. General</p>
                    <p>17. The military and economic power of the United States, and its political
                        and moral influence, still constitute the principal center of strength and
                        leadership for the free world. The manner in which the U.S. utilizes its
                        power will greatly influence the extent of progress which can be made in
                        developing resolution, a common purpose, and strength within the free world.
                        There is in the rest of the free world a substantial reservoir of political
                        and economic strength and a growing realization of the threat which Soviet
                        military power and political ideology pose for the national interests and
                        aspirations of all peoples.</p>
                    <p>18. However, the existence of varying interests and aspirations among the
                        peoples of the free world, though in many respects an element of strength,
                        also makes the free world subject to divisive influences. In particular,
                        conflicts have been created in important world areas by the rise of
                        nationalism, much of it anti-Western. Within some areas, a low standard of
                        living, an inflexible social structure, and ineffective leadership have
                        hindered the growth of internal strength and have exposed those areas to
                        Communist and extremist pressures.</p>
                    <p>19. In many parts of the free world there is also resentment, fear, and
                        distrust of the United States itself. In some quarters there is fear that
                        the U.S. will precipitate a general war and leave various countries
                        unprotected after doing so. There is resentment over U.S. trade policies.
                        There is a feeling among many of the dependent and semi-dependent people’s
                        that the U.S. is supporting the colonial powers. Despite their appreciation
                        of the importance of the U.S. to their survival and a desire for continued
                        U.S. economic aid, many countries are unhappy over the need to ask for U.S.
                        help, the made-in-America label on the aid when it is forthcoming, and the
                        open or implied U.S. requirement for support to U.S. policy in return.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Western Europe</p>
                    <p>20. During the period of this estimate Western European political and
                        economic strength will probably increase. The movement toward continental
                        integration and toward strengthening the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> structure will probably make further progress.
                        Ratification of the European Defense Community agreements and creation of
                        some form of limited European political authority are likely. There will
                        almost certainly be some increase in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        rearmament, including a start toward a German defense contribution, though
                        not as rapid as currently planned. Over-all Communist strength in <pb
                            xml:id="pg_191" n="191" facs="0221"/>Western Europe will probably
                        continue to decline, but the French and Italian Communist parties will
                        retain substantial propaganda and subversive capabilities and significant
                        political strength.</p>
                    <p>21. However, progress toward the U.S. objective of an economically viable and
                        militarily defensible Western Europe will still be beset by numerous
                        political and economic problems and Europe will remain in need of U.S.
                        leadership and material support. The difficulties involved in achieving
                        effective action by a coalition will almost certainly weigh heavily on the
                        military program. Moreover, even with U.S. aid, the European <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members probably will not meet current
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> goals. The allocation of a
                        sufficiently large share of resources to rearmament will continue to be
                        prevented by the political weakness of continental governments and their
                        reluctance to adopt more effective tax systems and anti-inflationary
                        controls. Inflation and other economic difficulties, together with a growing
                        feeling that the Soviet threat has diminished, will increase the political
                        pressures on Western European governments for curtailment of the rearmament
                        program.</p>
                    <p>22. Present indications are that West Germany will become a full member of
                        the European Defense Community sometime in 1953. Despite Soviet exploitation
                        of neutralist and unity sentiment in West Germany, most West Germans now
                        appear to recognize that unity on anything but Soviet terms is currently
                        almost impossible, and that Germany should join the Atlantic Community.
                        However, Soviet maneuvers, West German bargaining tactics, and French fears
                        of German dominance in Europe will probably delay West German
                        rearmament.</p>
                    <p>23. French economic and political instability appears likely to continue for
                        some years to come, and, as a result, France will almost certainly be unable
                        to meet its current <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments while
                        simultaneously maintaining a major effort in Indochina. However, France
                        almost certainly will remain firmly aligned with the Atlantic Community.</p>
                    <p>24. In Italy, the present coalition, led by the Christian Democrats, will
                        probably win the 1953 elections by a narrow margin, but it appears unlikely
                        that Italy will develop during this period sufficient economic or political
                        strength to be anything more than a weak ally.</p>
                    <p>25. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will remain the most important
                        European member of the Atlantic Community. Nevertheless, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will continue to be under severe economic
                        pressure, and the government may be compelled further to reduce its
                        rearmament goals.</p>
                    <p>26. The Berlin situation will continue to be a potentially explosive one.
                        Because the Kremlin continues to aim at the expulsion of the Western Powers,
                        the Soviet and East German governments <pb xml:id="pg_192" n="192"
                            facs="0222"/>almost certainly will continue to apply pressures upon the
                        Western sectors of the city.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia</p>
                    <p>27. The principal reaction of the Middle East to the impact of Western
                        civilization and the international political situation is a developing
                        nationalism which is both critical and imitative of the West. Demands for
                        political and social reform are increasing. The nature and rate of these
                        developments have varied from country to country. In some, the colonial
                        powers or the traditional ruling classes (large landowners, tribal sheiks,
                        and professional politicians) have retained control of the governments and
                        made only minor concessions to nationalist and reformist demands. In others,
                        Westernized or semi-Westernized urban elements have seized the political
                        initiative, Simultaneously, a revival of Islamic traditionalism is fostering
                        resistance to everything Western.</p>
                    <p>28. Although in most of these countries communism is not likely to become a
                        threat, at least during the period of this estimate, a gradual and
                        evolutionary political change in response to the new situation seems
                        unlikely. Political change will probably be uneven and spasmodic and is
                        likely to be accomplished by <hi rend="italic">coups d’état,</hi>
                        assassinations, and other revolutionary and semi-revolutionary processes,
                        accompanied by increasing authoritarianism.</p>
                    <p>29. There are, however, some countries in this area—Greece, Turkey, Israel,
                        Pakistan, and India—where there are more stable regimes less susceptible to
                        violent change. Greece, despite recurrent Cabinet crises, has virtually
                        eliminated the internal Communist threat. Turkey has demonstrated a capacity
                        for peaceful political change and is moving toward political democracy on
                        Western lines. Israel, while confronted with economic difficulties and the
                        problem of integrating peoples of varying cultural backgrounds, will
                        continue to be relatively stable. India and Pakistan—though troubled by
                        disputes between themselves, disturbed by social discontent and economic
                        evolution, and vulnerable to Communist infiltration and
                        subversion—nevertheless have accomplished major political revolutions and
                        are engaged in consolidating and stabilizing their new societies.</p>
                    <p>30. In Egypt a revolutionary <hi rend="italic">coups d’état,</hi> under the
                        auspices of young army officers has displaced the traditional ruling class.
                        The new group appears honest, energetic, and genuinely intent upon building
                        a new and better society. They have also given indications that they are
                        prepared to cooperate with the West. It is still unclear whether the present
                        moderate leadership can retain control over the military junta, whether it
                        can cope with counterattacks by the traditionally-dominant elements, and
                        whether it can make sufficient <pb xml:id="pg_193" n="193" facs="0223"
                        />progress in solving Egypt’s social and economic problems to prevent
                        disillusionment.</p>
                    <p>31. The principal center of instability is Iran. The traditional ruling
                        classes have lost the initiative to the National Front, which is an uneasy
                        coalition of secular urban groups and religious fanatics temporarily united
                        by a desire to rid the country of foreign influence. The Communists have
                        gained strength, but are not yet capable of seizing power. The oil dispute
                        has intensified nationalist and anti-Western feelings and aggravated
                        economic weaknesses. Regardless cf the outcome of this controversy,
                        instability will probably continue, with a Communist seizure of power
                        remaining a possibility.</p>
                    <p>32. In French North Africa, growing nationalism conflicts with French
                        determination to retain control. French concessions to North African
                        nationalism probably will forestall serious trouble for the next several
                        years, but the nationalists will remain unsatisfied. The problem of North
                        Africa will remain a source of friction among the non-Communist states which
                        the Communists will exploit.</p>
                    <p>33. Western military strength in the Mediterranean area will be increased by
                        growing Turkish military capabilities and by the development of Western
                        bases in Libya, French North Africa, and Cyprus. Nevertheless, the free
                        world military position in the Middle East as a whole is likely to remain
                        weak. Because of suspicions of Western motives and rivalries within the
                        area, it will be difficult to establish a Middle East defense organization.
                        Even if this organization is established, the countries of the area will be
                        unable to contribute significant forces to its support, and will continue to
                        resist the stationing of Western forces in their territories.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. The Far East</p>
                    <p>34. The rapid postwar expansion of Communist influence in the Far East
                        appears to have been checked at least temporarily. Some non-Communist
                        governments have increased in strength and stability. However, the area
                        remains vulnerable to further Communist exploitation because of the
                        widespread sentiment against “Western imperialism,” the desire for “national
                        independence” and improved economic status, and the ineffective leadership
                        of most non-Communist Far Eastern governments. Communist capabilities for
                        exploiting the situation in the Far East derive largely from the prestige
                        and military power of Communist China and the USSR, as well as the
                        disciplined energy and, in some cases, the armed strength of local Communist
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>35. The chief overt threat to established non-Communist governments in the
                        Far East has been from armed insurrections, most of <pb xml:id="pg_194"
                            n="194" facs="0224"/>them Communist-led “armed liberation” movements. It
                        now appears that the “armed liberation” movements have been reduced in
                        effectiveness or stalemated. In Burma the government has recently gained new
                        stability and is moving vigorously against the insurgents. In the
                        Philippines and Malaya, the Communist guerrilla movements have been
                        contained, but the Indonesian government continues to be threatened by
                        political factionalism and various insurrectionary movements. In none of
                        these areas has armed resistance been eliminated, and it will continue to
                        place a strain on government energy and resources.</p>
                    <p>36. In Indochina the situation is one of political and military stalemate. No
                        decisive shift in the balance is likely during the period of this estimate.
                        The French military effort in that country constitutes a heavy drain on the
                        resources of metropolitan France. We believe that the French will continue
                        their commitment in Indochina at approximately the present level, but will
                        attempt to transfer to the U.S. the burden of any increasing costs or
                        additional effort.</p>
                    <p>37. In Korea, the Communists have the capability of launching a large-scale
                        offensive virtually without warning. We believe that the Communists will
                        protract the armistice negotiations so long as they consider that they can
                        continue to gain political and military advantages from the situation in
                        Korea and so long as they estimate that a continuation of the Korean war
                        does not involve grave risk of global war. Even if an armistice is
                        concluded, Korea will almost certainly remain an area of grave danger, and
                        the object of intensive Communist political warfare.</p>
                    <p>38. The emergence of Japan as a Far Eastern power aligned with the West has
                        contributed greatly to strengthening the non-Communist position in that
                        area. During the period of this estimate, Japan will almost certainly
                        maintain its present alignment with the West and will probably make gradual
                        progress with its rearmament. In the long run, however, Japan’s continued
                        association with the Western powers will depend largely upon whether Japan’s
                        serious economic problems can be solved in cooperation with the West. If
                        they are not so solved, the Japanese may be compelled to seek closer
                        political and economic relations with the Communist Bloc in order to obtain
                        the trade Japan requires.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Latin America</p>
                    <p>39. The traditional social order in Latin America is disintegrating. This
                        process has produced political instability more profound than that which in
                        the past characterized the personal politics of Latin America. The political
                        trend is toward extremely nationalistic regimes based on support by the
                        depressed masses, of which the <pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0225"
                        />Peron regime in Argentina is the prototype. The numerical strength of the
                        Communists has declined, but the Communists, operating through various
                        fronts, can readily exploit the social unrest and ultra-nationalism already
                        existing in the non-Communist population. Both Communists and extreme
                        nationalists seek, by propaganda and intrigue, to curtail Latin American
                        cooperation with the United States.</p>
                    <p>40. For the period of this estimate, the present degree and scope of Latin
                        American cooperation with the United States is likely to remain basically
                        unchanged. In particular, Latin American strategic raw materials will
                        continue to be available, but the governments concerned will seek to drive
                        hard bargains in terms of price and economic concessions, including
                        allotments of goods in short supply. The Communists are unlikely to gain
                        direct control of any Latin American country. There is, however, a trend
                        toward the development of a bloc of ultra-nationalistic, isolationist South
                        American states. Eventually, this development may adversely affect, not only
                        U.S. interests in Latin America, but also the strength and unity of the free
                        world.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="strong">III. Probable Soviet Estimate of the Situation and
                            Probable Communist Courses of Action</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>41. We believe that all Kremlin policies and courses of action are directed
                        toward the attainment of the Kremlin’s long-range objective of a Communist
                        world dominated by Moscow.</p>
                    <p>42. Soviet Bloc strength has improved greatly since the end of World War II.
                        Despite this increase in strength, the Kremlin almost certainly estimates
                        that general war would be a gamble, involving at a minimum widespread
                        destruction in the Bloc and the risk that the Kremlin’s system of control
                        would be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>43. The Kremlin almost certainly estimates that the states of Western Europe
                        are now more stable than at any time since World War II; that the position
                        of most non-Communist states in Asia is somewhat stronger than in 1950; that
                        progress has been made toward the unification and rearmament of Western
                        Europe and toward improving the West’s defenses in the Pacific; and that the
                        U.S. has made great strides toward developing its economic and military
                        power and toward providing leadership for the West. Moreover, the Kremlin
                        probably estimates that the West is making rapid progress in the development
                        and production of new weapons.</p>
                    <p>44. However, the Kremlin almost certainly estimates that opportunities remain
                        for continued progress toward its long-range objective without resort to
                        general war. It probably estimates that:</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_196" n="196" facs="0226"/>
                    <p>a. The growth of Bloc economic and military power will increase Bloc prestige
                        and influence throughout the non-Communist world.</p>
                    <p>b. The non-Communist great powers, aside from the U.S., are much weaker than
                        they were before World War II.</p>
                    <p>c. The economies of the non-Communist states are highly vulnerable to
                        depression and inflationary crises, which would have serious social and
                        political repercussions.</p>
                    <p>d. Future developments, such as the revival of West German military power,
                        the intrusion of German and Japanese products into export markets now
                        dominated by other states, and conflicting tariff and trade policies, will
                        undermine, if not destroy, Western political unity and the foundations of
                        Western prosperity.</p>
                    <p>e. Opportunity exists for weakening the position of the Western powers and
                        strengthening the position of Communism by exploiting the discontent and
                        nationalist aspirations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>45. The Kremlin almost certainly estimates that the divergent interests of
                        the Western Powers will sooner or later weaken or destroy their present
                        unity. It probably also believes that no international organization which
                        does not have the centralized leadership and control which the USSR provides
                        the Bloc can survive the strains and pressures of modern political
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>46. We believe that the outlook is for a continuation of Soviet efforts to
                        undermine and destroy the non-Communist world by cold war tactics. The
                        Communists will resort to armed aggression and to armed revolt by indigenous
                        Communist parties when they believe these courses of action are the best
                        means to achieve Communist objectives. If the growth of free world strength
                        and unity continues, however, the Communists will probably place greater
                        emphasis upon “united front” tactics and upon propaganda and diplomatic
                        moves designed to split the Western allies and to promote dissension within
                        non-Soviet countries.</p>
                    <p>47. Thus, great danger to the free world during the period of this estimate
                        will lie in political and economic difficulties and divisions within the
                        free world itself which would check the development of free world unity and
                        strength and lend themselves to Communist exploitation.</p>
                    <p>48. We believe it unlikely that the Kremlin will deliberately initiate
                        general war during the period of this estimate. However, there will be
                        continuing grave danger that general war may arise from a series of actions
                        and counteractions in a situation which neither side desired to develop into
                        general war.</p>

                                    >NSC</gloss> 79 project had been “carried on the <gloss

                                Staff, stated that there was a feeling among the Staff “that this

                                and the discussion swiftly focused on “<gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                                it might be advisable to set down such a series of alternative

                                “agreed to undertake the responsibility for attempting to draft such

                                Sept. 24, 1952 in <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss

                        </note> When that is completed, which I understand will be at the beginning
                        of next week, we might get together on the whole business. There is, as I
                        see it, apart from the question of the substance of the new draft, one chief
                        point for decision— namely, what form of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        action are we shooting for at this stage. In this connection, I am attaching
                        a memorandum which has been prepared for me giving the record on this 79
                        project. You will note that it originated with a <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> request for more clear-cut U.S. objectives than could be
                        found in either 20/4 or <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68. I feel
                        therefore that the paper that we submit at this stage and the course of
                        action to be followed thereafter in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        must have some relationship to the original purpose for which the project
                        was <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0228"/>listed. My suggestion would be
                        that once we have agreed on the substance of the present memorandum that it
                        should go to the Steering Committee in relation to the 79 item for
                        consideration as to whether or not in the light thereof a policy paper for
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Council adoption could be worked
                        out. If the decision is that it should be, then I would suggest that it be
                        returned to State (to <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>) for development
                        since as you will see from the composition of the originating committee set
                        up in 1950 there are many agencies represented thereon who would not be able
                        to contribute much to a policy paper on this subject. Another alternative
                        would be for us to suggest that an interdepartmental committee of State,
                        Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> be set up to develop a
                        policy paper from this draft. A third, which I will admit that I favor,
                        would be a discussion and elaboration by the Steering Committee or a special
                        group of the Halle draft not with a view to developing a policy paper but to
                        examining further the elements of the problem treated in the Halle draft. Of
                        course, there remains the transmission of this paper for information with a
                        suggestion that the item be cancelled as unsuitable at this time for a
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy decision.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing are merely suggestions which you could be thinking over prior
                        to the meeting next week when the revised paper is finished.</p>

                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 79 project started with a memorandum
                        dated 22 August 1950 to the Secretary of Defense from the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff. This memorandum called for “clear-cut United States objectives in the
                        event of war” to serve both as a basis for military planning, “both prior to
                        and during hostilities, in order to provide that our military efforts are
                        directed toward the winning of the ultimate peace as well as to the winning
                        of the war.” Such a statement should also insure that our military
                        operations will be supported by our allies and the American people. It
                        stated further that neither 20/4 or <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68
                        were adequate for the purpose. The Joint Chiefs recommended that such a
                        statement be developed in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. The
                        Secretary of Defense forwarded this memorandum to the <pb xml:id="pg_199"
                            n="199" facs="0229"/>Executive Secretary of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> and supported the request of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                    <p>2. On September 6 the Senior Staff (a) approved a memo to the National
                        Security Council advising it of the Staff’s decision to prepare for
                        consideration by the Council a draft report on the subject to include both a
                        statement of war objectives in the event of global war and such related
                        questions as a statement of the conditions that the U.S. would be willing to
                        accept for a peaceful settlement with the USSR and its satellites; (b)
                        constituted the following <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> group of assistants
                        to undertake preliminary work on the project: Department of State—Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Paul Nitze</persName>, Chairman,
                        Department of Defense—Mr. James T. Hill, <gloss target="#t_NSRB1"
                            >NSRB</gloss>—Mr. T. G. Lamphier, Jr., Treasury Department—Mr. C. D.
                        Glendinning, Joint Chiefs of Staff—Rear Admiral Leslie C. Stevens, Central
                        Intelligence Agency—Mr. DeForest Van Slyck, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Staff—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GLEASONSE1">S. E.
                            Gleason</persName>; (c) agreed that after preliminary exploration of the
                        problem by the <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> group, the State Department
                        Policy Planning Staff should prepare the first draft of a report in the
                        light of the discussion by the <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> group.</p>
                    <p>3. On October 2 the Senior Staff “agreed to establish November 15, 1950 as
                        the target date for completion of a report on the subject for consideration
                        by the National Security Council.”</p>
                    <p>4. On October 6, 1950 the Steering Group under Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Nitze</persName>’s chairmanship met for the first,
                        last and only time.</p>
                    <p>5. On February 23, 1951 the Senior Staff “Discussed the status of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 79 project, agreed that it should be
                        divided into two projects, as follows, and that the second project should be
                        completed as a matter of priority: (1) A statement of U.S. and allied war
                        objectives in the event of global war. (2) A statement of the conditions
                        that the United States would be willing to accept for a peaceful settlement
                        with the USSR, including a plan for the reduction and regulation of
                        armaments and armed forces.”</p>
                    <p>6. In July of 1951 the Council and the President approved <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 112 entitled “Formulation of United States
                        Position with Respect to a Regulation, Limitation and Balanced Reduction of
                        Armed Forces and Armament.”<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">For documentation on

                    </p>
                    <p>7. Some time in the fall of 1951 a note was taken in the Status of Projects
                        of the fact that Council’s action and the work in Paris at the General
                        Assembly on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 112 was a partial response
                        to that part of 79 calling for a statement for “conditions for a peaceful
                        settlement with the USSR.”</p>
                    <p>8. Some time last spring Jimmy Lay suggested carrying in the Status of

                        War</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p rend="center">Summary of Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. Our present conflict with the Soviet Union cannot be definitively ended in
                        our favor short of the elimination or radical modification of the Soviet
                        regime. While this would be the most desirable outcome, our national
                        interest might be adequately secured by success that fell short of this
                        absolute attainment. It could not be set as an objective of the conflict
                        itself, moreover, in the absence of global war, without strongly implying
                        that our national interest requires global war, which would be contrary to
                        our basic policy of averting war.</p>
                    <p>2. A global war would represent a phase of the present conflict which was not
                        necessarily final. Our prime objective in that phase would be to achieve the
                        greatest possible improvement of our position in the conflict, subject to
                        the overriding requirement that the cost be less than the destruction of the
                        elements of our own civilization.</p>
                    <p>3. Our immediate war-aims would be (first) survival through strategic
                        defense, and (second) assurance of survival through victory.</p>
                    <p>4. We would work for the re-establishment, after the elimination of the
                        Soviet system, of a world of diversity in which all nations could enjoy
                        reasonable scope for development in accordance with their respective needs
                        and dispositions, under the protection of an effective rule of law that
                        insured their peace and security.</p>
                    <p>5. Such a rule of law would require the establishment of a world authority
                        equipped to enforce minimum standards of behavior on the nations, which
                        authority would prescribe what military forces <pb xml:id="pg_201" n="201"
                            facs="0231"/>each nation might maintain, and what forces, if any, each
                        should hold available to it for enforcement action.</p>
                    <p>6. The United States, while subject to the authority, might expect to have,
                        as the preponderant power in the world, the leading role in its direction;
                        but its position of leadership would be held as trustee for the entire world
                        community of nations, and its special responsibility would have to be
                        discharged on behalf of that community in order for it to count on the
                        community’s continuing consent to its leadership.</p>
                    <p>7. With respect to Russia, our objective after the elimination of the Soviet
                        regime and system would be its replacement by a respectable native regime
                        with which we could conclude a genuine peace of mutual agreement, leading to
                        its full participation in the organization of the post-war world. This would
                        require us to limit the identification of our enemy in the war to the Soviet
                        regime and system, eschewing any doctrine of national or popular guilt.</p>
                    <p>8. A genuine peace with a Russian successor government would have to preserve
                        Russia’s essential territorial integrity and should leave Russia (like any
                        other country with respect to which such determination could be made)
                        neither too strong for the security of others nor too weak for the discharge
                        of its proper responsibilities in the world. This suggests that Russian
                        territory might well be retracted at least to the 1938 borders of the Soviet
                        Union. The postwar status of the Baltic states cannot now be determined, but
                        there is no occasion for the United States to change its present official
                        position of recognizing their right to independence. The post-war status of
                        the Ukraine, White Russia, and the other territories occupied by “minor
                        nationalities” should, for the most part, be determined between them and the
                        successor government of Russia as an essentially domestic matter. We should
                        refrain from committing ourselves to their independence or
                        quasi-independence, we should refrain from guaranteeing them the opportunity
                        of self-determination, and we should refrain also from committing ourselves
                        to their continued association with Great Russia. In sum, we should not make
                        ourselves responsible for determining or maintaining their post-war
                            status.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">

                        shortcomings. Despite its inadequacies, the report is, I think, useful and
                        can serve as the basis for a discussion by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> of the major respects in which our security programs need
                        to be adjusted.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Questions Involving Atomic Energy</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Atomic Equation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The tone of the report does not reflect my own serious concern about the
                        implications of atomic developments. A careful reading of the report (part
                        II, p. 64, paras. 99a, b, and c, and Part I, p. 27, paras. 22a, b, and c,
                        and p. 29, Conclusion (a)) will perhaps lead the reader to draw these
                        implications, but I wish they might have been stated with emphasis.</p>
                    <p>For some time to come (perhaps indefinitely assuming a continuation of
                        present programs), the United States will be heavily dependent on the atomic
                        threat to deter the Soviet Union from attempting to expand into areas of
                        vital importance, and on the strategic use of atomic weapons if it is to
                        achieve military victory in the event of general war.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_203" n="203" facs="0233"/>
                    <p>The report raises a doubt whether our net capability to injure the Soviet
                        Union is increasing (the increasing defensive capability of the Soviet Union
                        may be offsetting our increasing offensive capability). The report makes
                        clear, on the other hand, that the net capability of the Soviet Union to
                        injure the United States must already be measured in terms of many millions
                        of casualties and many billions of property damage, and is rapidly
                        increasing.</p>
                    <p>This leads me to question whether the U.S. Government will be willing to use
                        the atomic threat or to follow through on it in the event of any Soviet move
                        short of direct atomic attack on the United States. We may find that Soviet
                        moves which we now think we would regard as <hi rend="italic">casus
                            belli</hi> will not, in the event, lead us to threaten or initiate the
                        use of atomic weapons. To the extent that our view of what constitutes a <hi
                            rend="italic">casus belli</hi> does in fact change, we become less able
                        to avoid such cumulative cold war losses as might spell eventual defeat.</p>
                    <p>I do not think that there is, even now, a general understanding in the U.S.
                        Government that vulnerability to Soviet attack may prevent <gloss
                            target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> from ever leaving the ground; nor that our
                        ability to penetrate Soviet defenses is not increasing any faster, if as
                        fast, as Soviet defensive capabilities.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Vulnerability of our Allies to Atomic Attack</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I do not think that we have yet thought through the implications of the
                        vulnerability of our allies, particularly our Western European allies and
                        Japan, to Soviet atomic attack. Because of their proximity to Soviet bases,
                        it is probably impossible for them to develop an effective defense, if only
                        because the best early warning system could not provide much warning. It
                        seems to me that this has implications in a struggle between democratic
                        societies and a totalitarian system which are ominous, and which we have not
                        really faced.</p>
                    <p>I recognize that this is a subject of utmost delicacy—and that it might
                        easily lead the faint of heart to unwarranted conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Yet it does seem to me that somewhere in this Government there should be a
                        frank recognition of these implications—for the survival of the nation may
                        depend upon our preparedness to deal with a situation in which these allies
                        are simply not willing to face a Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Relation to Requirements for Conventional Forces</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The report does not deal with the significance of growing Soviet atomic
                        capabilities on the changing nature of the requirements of United States
                        military forces. I am concerned, for example, that we have not provided for
                        adequate dispersion of air fields and that we are not developing the new
                        logistic techniques which are necessary in light of Soviet capabilities to
                        attack ports. There are surely <pb xml:id="pg_204" n="204" facs="0234"/>many
                        other implications for force, base and other requirements, including
                        requirements for the development of new tactics and techniques.</p>
                    <p>Above all, however, it seems to me that we must consider whether atomic
                        developments are such that the United States and its allies should take
                        action designed to remove their dependence on the strategic use of atomic
                        weapons in the event of general war. The implication, in terms of
                        requirements for conventional forces, of this conclusion would be very
                        great.</p>

                            >A</gloss>-Weapons in Situations Short of General War</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The paper does not discuss the effect of our relative atomic “plenty” on our
                        ability to deal with limited aggression. It is my belief that we now have a
                        stockpile of sufficient size to enable us to use these weapons locally where
                        their use would be militarily effective and did not involve more than
                        offsetting political disadvantages. Our stockpile is now an asset which is
                        usually regarded as frozen until and unless general war breaks out. We have
                        not fully analyzed the balance between the considerations for using these
                        weapons to increase the limited capability of our conventional forces to
                        deal with local situations as against the contra political and strategic
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The National Interest of the United States with Respect
                            to the Strategic Use of Atomic Weapons</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here I wish to revert to the point made in the second paragraph under point
                        3, and to single it out for special emphasis. The prospect is, in my
                        judgment, that it would be in our interest to develop such conventional
                        forces that we would not be dependent for victory in the event of global war
                        on the use of atomic weapons, particularly against strategic targets. Both
                        because of physical factors and because of certain advantages of the
                        totalitarian system (secrecy, relative immunity to, and ability to control,
                        public opinion, centralized decision-making), the United States is more
                        vulnerable to atomic attack than the Soviet Union. This suggests to me that
                        it would be desirable to overcome our dependence on atomic weapons. At
                        present we would be compelled to use them despite the losses we would
                        suffer. It will be a large task to overcome this dependence, but I believe
                        it can be done.</p>
                    <p>If the use of atomic weapons could be limited to tactical uses, it is quite
                        possible our very great superiority in numbers of weapons would be to our
                        advantage. It is difficult to see, however, how a precise dividing line can
                        be drawn, or lived up to, separating tactical from strategic uses.</p>

                    <p>Our national security programs have never actually been consistent with our

                                target="#pg_142">p. 142</ref>.</note> This became clear in the
                        course of the work on this project when the Defense representatives stated
                        time and again, in answer to the point that the defense program would not
                        produce the situation of strength defined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 135/3, that the defense program had never been designed to
                        produce any such situation of strength. The issue here is whether we are
                        really satisfied with programs which in fact have the objective of making us
                        a sort of hedge-hog, unattractive to attack, but basically not very
                        worrisome over a period of time beyond our immediate position, or whether we
                        take the objectives stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20, 68,
                        114, and 135 sufficiently seriously as to warrant doing what is necessary to
                        give us some chance of seeing these objectives attained.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Other Limitations of the Report</p>
                    <p>1. The paper does not deal with the most important immediate and concrete
                        problems. To have dealt adequately with the Korean armistice, Indochina,
                        Iran, <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> ratification problems or with the
                        concrete elements of the economic problem would have been both impossible
                        and unwise. Each of these problems in its concrete form is being more
                        actively and deeply considered in other forums.</p>
                    <p>2. In preparing the paper we were unable to extract specific force
                        requirements or cost estimates and very limited estimates as to the
                        potential effectiveness of additional programs.</p>
                    <p>3. The paper needs a number of drafting and organizational changes which we
                        will try to work out in the next day or two on the basis of comments which
                        have been requested from the various bureaus of the Department.</p>

                    <p>1. Pursuant to authorization of the President there is hereby directed the
                        preparation of a summary evaluation of the USSR’s net capability to inflict
                        direct injury on the United States, to be submitted to the Council on or
                        before 15 May 1953. This evaluation will cover the period up to 1 July 1955,
                        and will consider USSR net capabilities against the continental United
                        States and major US installations outside the United States, such
                        installations to be selected on the basis of their importance to defense of
                        the continental United States or to a United States counteroffensive against
                        the USSR. The evaluation will cover all possible types of attack, including
                        direct military, clandestine military, and sabotage, physical and
                        non-physical. The evaluation will deal primarily with the initial phases of
                        war, or the period during which all or a major part of the Soviet atomic or
                        thermonuclear weapon stockpile might be expended.</p>
                    <p>2. In order to carry out this directive, there is hereby constituted a

                    <p> Re-examination of United States Programs for National Security</p>
                    <p>We are enclosing herewith certain materials which you requested us to submit
                        pursuant to National Security Council Action No. 668.</p>
                    <p>We believe it important to point out in this covering memorandum what this
                        study has attempted to accomplish—as well as what it has not attempted to
                        accomplish.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 contains a balanced statement of
                        the position of the United States in the world today; the threats which face
                        us in the period ahead; and our basic strategy for meeting these threats.
                        This study takes <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 as its starting
                        point and makes no effort to restate or re-examine the conclusions reached
                        in that paper.</p>
                    <p>The present study deals with the limited question as to whether the
                        allocation of our resources under existing programs is appropriately related
                        to the threats which we face and to our strategy for meeting these threats.
                        The nature of this examination necessarily results in a concentration of
                        attention on the dangers ahead and the respects in which existing programs
                        may not adequately meet these dangers. In view of the limited purpose of
                        this paper, no attempt was made to obtain the same over-all balanced view of
                        our position as was contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3.
                        Nor was any attempt made to indicate what has been accomplished in the last
                        few years or what strains and difficulties our growing strength is causing
                        the U.S.S.R. We point these facts out in order that the study not be <pb
                            xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0241"/>misunderstood and interpreted as an
                        unduly pessimistic assessment of our position at the present time.</p>
                    <p>We also wish to emphasize one additional point. This study reaches the
                        conclusion that there is need to apply more resources to our continental
                        defense and our civil defense programs. This conclusion has as its premise
                        that these programs for defense of the United States against atomic attack
                        constitute new and distinct requirements and that resources additional to
                        those now programmed should be made available to meet them. No conclusion
                        has been reached as to the extent to which these programs should be
                        undertaken in the event additional resources are not made available. We feel
                        that we must not sacrifice our capability of projecting our power abroad by
                        concentrating too heavily on the purely defensive aspects of our security
                        should general war occur.</p>
                    <p>In view of the short time available, we have not had an adequate opportunity
                        to carry to greater depth and precision the consideration of certain of the
                        basic questions dealt with in the study, particularly with respect to the
                        impact on our strategy and programs of modern atomic weapons. Nor has there
                        been an opportunity to consult with other interested departments and
                        agencies with respect to those portions of the study with which they may be
                        particularly concerned. It is therefore suggested that it may be desirable
                        for the National Security Council to take this study under further
                        consideration.</p>

                        <item>a. There has been a reduction of the prospects for an early settlement
                            of the Korean issue. This is indicated by the Communist rejection of the

                            rulers will direct their major efforts during the immediate future to
                            dividing and weakening the Western alliance, while maintaining and
                            perhaps increasing their cold-war pressures against what they estimate

                    <p rend="center">I. Distribution of Resources Between United States and Other
                        Free World Military Forces</p>
                    <p>1. The first question is whether the present allocation of resources as
                        between United States military forces and other free world forces is
                        appropriate. This question has two aspects which should be separately
                        considered. One is the requirements for air and civil defenses for North
                        America in light of the growing Soviet atomic threat. The other aspect
                        involves the question whether the requirements for military forces in the
                        free world could be more efficiently and effectively met than at present by
                        changing the present allocation of resources as between United States and
                        other free world forces. These two aspects are separately considered
                        below.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Defense of the United States Against the Soviet
                        Atomic Threat Relevant Considerations</p>
                    <p>2. The defense of the United States against the growing Soviet atomic threat
                        involves both passive and active defense measures. For some years to come
                        the deterrent power of the United States will reside largely in its ability
                        to deliver an atomic attack of tremendous force upon the Soviet Union. The
                        power of our striking forces is now substantial and is improving. For the
                        foreseeable future, the willingness of the United States to employ atomic
                        weapons in the event of general war is essential to the success of our
                        strategic plans. The willingness of the United States, however, to initiate
                        an atomic attack in the event that the Soviet rulers take certain actions
                        which we would regard as a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> will be
                        significantly affected by the casualties and destruction which the Soviet
                        system could inflict in retaliation. Even at the present time, these
                        casualties and this destruction would be very high and the prospect, under a
                        continuation of our present programs, will rapidly worsen. There is an
                        increasing danger that unless a large-scale civil defense program and
                        measures to improve greatly our defense against air and sea attack are
                        undertaken, the United States might find its freedom of action seriously
                        impaired in an emergency.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_214" n="214" facs="0244"/>
                    <p>3. It is estimated that American Civil Defense is only 10% to 15% effective
                        at the present time and that a continuation of present programs will no more
                        than double this effectiveness by the end of 1954. Additional
                        programs—particularly for shelters— could substantially improve the
                        situation. Care should be taken in developing and carrying out any new civil
                        defense program to minimize the fear of atomic attack throughout the country
                        and to avoid wasting resources on areas not likely to be attacked.</p>
                    <p>4. With respect to active defense, our present capability to defend the
                        continental United States from atomic attack is considered to be extremely
                        limited. As of mid-1952 probably 65–85% of the atomic bombs launched by the
                        U.S.S.R. could be delivered on target in the United States. Defensive
                        measures in current programs will not provide an effective defense against
                        mass atomic attack. The U.S.S.R. will possess, in the period 1954–1955, the
                        capability to make an air attack upon the United States which would
                        represent a blow of critical proportions. There are, however, a number of
                        additional measures which, if accomplished, would materially increase our
                        capability to meet the atomic threat in 1955 and thereafter. Whatever
                        additional programs are undertaken in the immediate future, there is a clear
                        need for additional intensive research and development in this field.</p>
                    <p>5. The best defense of the United States in this period of weapons transition
                        lies in an effective land, sea and air offensive capability sufficient to
                        deter the would-be aggressor or render him impotent should he choose to
                        attack.</p>

                    <list>
                        <item>a. A continuation of our continental defense and civil defense
                            programs at the level of present appropriations involves critical
                            risks.</item>
                        <item>b. Basic to the attainment of the objectives defined in <gloss

                        <item>c. These programs constitute distinct and new requirements on the
                            United States for which additional resources must be provided if the
                            United States is to guard itself against the threat of atomic attack
                            without disrupting its programs for building strength in the free
                            world.</item>
                        <item>d. Additional programs should be prepared as a matter of urgency in
                            such detail as to provide firm cost estimates and firmer estimates (1)
                            of the results which could be accomplished by the programs and (2) of
                            their impact on other security programs.</item>

                    <p>9. The purpose to be served by building up the military strength of allied
                        and friendly nations varies from case to case. The buildup of Japanese and
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces will increase the ability
                        of the free world to wage global war and will thereby provide additional
                        deterrents to overt aggression by the U.S.S.R. and to limited aggression by
                        China or the European satellites. In the Middle East, however, with the
                        exception of Turkey and possibly Pakistan, there is no immediate opportunity
                        to create forces strong enough to be of major significance in the event of
                        global war. Initially, the purposes to be served by building up local forces
                        in this area are to (1) strengthen the structure of government, (2) provide
                        internal security, and (3) obtain base and transit rights for U.S. military
                        forces. In creating such forces, the weak and unstable economies in the area
                        must be taken into account. In South and Southeast Asia, it will be a long
                        time before any forces can be created which would exercise a significant
                        influence in the event of global war. But stronger indigenous forces in this
                        area would serve not only to provide internal security (as in the Middle
                        East); they would also ultimately contribute to security against the threat
                        of expanded aggression by communist China. Finally, the development of
                        effective local forces in Japan, South Korea, and Viet Nam would not only
                        serve these local purposes, but would also free United States forces now
                        deployed in the Far East, or, in the case of Viet Nam, French forces, for
                        other assignments and thereby have a doubly beneficial effect. In general,
                        it is clear that the strain on United States forces can be reduced and an
                        adequate strategic reserve reconstituted only as other free world forces are
                        strengthened and improved in these areas.</p>
                    <p>10. The volume of resources that can be effectively used in building up the
                        military forces of allied and friendly nations in the Middle East and Asia
                        is limited by the rate at which such resources can be absorbed, and by such
                        special political circumstances as the constitutional prohibition of
                        rearmament in Japan, the popular distrust of French motives in Viet Nam, and
                        India’s distrust of Pakistan. A build-up more rapid than envisaged in
                        present programs would appear to be possible and desirable (a) in the
                        immediate future in Korea, Indochina, and Formosa and on a modest scale in
                        the Middle East, (b) in Japan, as soon as the constitutional and political
                        obstacles can be overcome, and in Pakistan, if it can be accomplished
                        without involving unmanageable problems with India, and (c) perhaps at a
                        later date in other Asian countries.</p>
                    <p>11. In the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries of Western Europe,
                        the build-up of military forces could be accelerated through the use of
                        United States resources. The military efforts that can be put forth by these
                        countries themselves are, however, sharply limited by their economic <pb
                            xml:id="pg_216" n="216" facs="0246"/>and political capabilities.
                        Continued pressure by the United States for a military effort greater than
                        justified by the European sense of urgency would weaken the alliance. In the
                        last analysis, United States diplomatic pressure and economic aid cannot
                        substitute for a political determination by the Europeans to devote larger
                        resources to their own security. Even if it is not possible to secure a
                        major increase in the level of the defense effort of the European <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, and even if no strong case can
                        be made for a major increase in the level of United States assistance, there
                        is nevertheless good reason for certain specific revisions to provide, for
                        instance, for some air defense measures and to fill several of the more
                        serious recognized gaps in present defense plans, such as the inadequate
                        provision for interceptors and ammunition reserves. But apart from the
                        continuation and improvement of present <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> programs, a large part of the additional build-up of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military strength can only come
                        from the creation of German contingents.</p>
                    <p>12. It will be necessary to make more effective and flexible use of United
                        States resources in order to ensure during the period 1954–55 a volume of
                        military supplies and equipment sufficient to permit (a) the presently
                        planned build-up of United Forces, (b) the presently scheduled delivery of
                        equipment to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, German, Japanese and
                        South Korean forces, and (c) provision for a somewhat increased rate of
                        build-up and the setting of somewhat larger force goals in the case of
                        certain Asian and Middle Eastern nations. United States war reserves now
                        programmed must continue to be regarded as available to help meet unforeseen
                        contingencies in the cold war. This is an additional reason for building up
                        these general war reserves to programmed levels. And as the mobilization
                        base is developed and production levels off, the base must be kept in a
                        condition which will permit its rapid utilization.</p>

                    <list>
                        <item>a. The build-up of U.S. forces to presently planned levels should be
                            completed as rapidly as practicable. The present programs are believed
                            to be adequate for this task, provided they are not subject to repeated
                            downward adjustment and delay.</item>
                        <item>b. The allocation of a growing share of U.S. output of military
                            end-items to our allies is consistent with a. It is also urgently needed
                            in light of the threats facing the U.S. in certain key strategic areas
                            on the periphery of the Soviet bloc and is feasible in terms of the
                            absorptive capacity of certain friendly countries. However, allocation
                            and delivery of military end-items and other material should be based on
                            the ability of the recipient nations to maintain the material and use it
                            effectively. Any increase in present military assistance programs should
                            depend upon the contribution such an increase can make to the collective
                            security of the free world. Each area must be considered on its
                            merits.</item>

                        <item>c. Present programs are inadequate to exploit all opportunities for
                            developing effective local forces in Asia and the Middle East. The
                            devotion of moderate additional resources to this purpose in the Middle
                            East and South Asia, and substantially larger additional resources in
                            the Far East, together with required political measures, would greatly
                            strengthen the free world against what is believed to be, for the next
                            few years, the most immediate threat with which it is confronted.</item>
                        <item>d. Substantial additional resources could be used in building up
                            additional military forces in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. In view, however, of the nature of the circumstances which
                            limit the military effort of which the Europeans seem capable, no
                            attempt should be made to secure a general upward revision of present
                            programs. It seems clear, however, that in Europe, as elsewhere,
                            substantial military assistance programs will have to continue over a
                            period of years. The main effort of the United States in this area
                            should be concentrated upon (a) resisting further whittling down and
                            postponing of present military programs, (b) insuring that there is
                            steady progress in carrying out these programs, and (c) fulfilling U.S.
                            commitments to deliver military equipment. However, specific programs to
                            fill particular gaps should be urged and, if necessary, financially
                            supported.</item>

                            programs, the present state of the U.S. military reserve forces will
                            involve acute risks in the event of new acts of local aggression or of
                            general war so long as U.S. forces are committed in Korea and present
                            manpower policies remain in effect.</item>

                    <p>13. The third question is whether the present balance between military
                        assistance and the various types of economic assistance is appropriate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relevant Considerations</p>
                    <p>14. We believe that the following considerations are relevant to this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows paragraph 14 a, outlining the relevant considerations involved
                        in assessing the relationship of military and economic assistance.]</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>b. It will almost certainly be necessary for the U.S. to continue for
                            a period beyond 1955 to provide military assistance to a number of its
                            major allies, particularly the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries (and Germany) and also Japan, if forces envisaged in present
                            programs are to be achieved and maintained. It should be recognized that
                            insofar as such continued military assistance involves off-shore
                            procurement, it will also contribute directly to the alleviation of
                            balance of payments difficulties and, therefore, reduce the need for
                            other kinds of economic aid.</item>
                        <item>c. There will continue to be countries—notably Greece, Turkey, Korea,
                            and perhaps at a later date Pakistan and Viet Nam—in which the burden of
                            the military effort undertaken is so heavy and is of such importance to
                            us, and whose economic capabilities are so <pb xml:id="pg_218" n="218"
                                facs="0248"/>limited, that it will be necessary and desirable to
                            assist them indefinitely in meeting a part of the financial burden of
                            their defense. This is clearly the case where the alternative to such
                            assistance is an increased requirement for U.S. forces. Also there will
                            continue to be countries, like Austria and Formosa, which have special
                            economic difficulties, which are important to our security, and to which
                            it will probably be necessary to continue to provide grant aid.</item>
                        <item>d. Direct economic assistance on a grant basis tends to have
                            unfavorable political and psychological repercussions, and it is
                            desirable to avoid the use of grants-in-aid where practicable. The
                            amounts of economic assistance required in the form of grants-in-aid
                            will, however, probably not be large, especially if off-shore
                            procurement and other U.S. military expenditures are continued in the
                            countries of Western Europe and Japan and if new forms are developed for
                            financing productive investment in those parts of the world and in those
                            types of projects which offer a reasonable chance of repayment but with
                            some danger of foreign exchange difficulties.</item>

                        <item>a. A healthy society is the essential basis of a strong defense, and
                            economic capabilities set a limit to the size of the defense program a
                            society can, at any given time, safely undertake. It may well be that in
                            the future it will be desirable to give somewhat more emphasis than at
                            present to economic assistance, particularly to areas outside Western
                            Europe, and to needed changes in our foreign economic policies. There
                            may be cases in which it will be necessary and desirable to carry out
                            economic programs even at the cost of reducing or stretching out
                            military programs. A specific answer to the question of the balance
                            between economic and military assistance could only be given on the
                            basis of the varying situation country by country.</item>
                        <item>b. It is desirable that we have flexibility to shift funds as between
                            areas and as between uses in whatever way will best advance our security
                            interests.</item>
                        <item>c. There is need for a large flow of both private and public capital
                            from the United States to the rest of the world, a need which must be
                            expected to be long continued. Only a part of the public funds provided
                            for this purpose need to be in the form of grants-in-aid, but not all of
                            them can be provided in the form of fixed dollar loans. There is need to
                            develop new forms of intergovernmental financing of productive
                            investment in those parts of the world and for those types of projects
                            that offer a reasonable chance of repayment but with some danger of
                            foreign exchange difficulties.</item>
                        <item>d. There is a need to search for ways of minimizing the adverse
                            political and psychological effects of continued grant assistance where
                            such assistance is necessary.</item>

                            urgent as it is, is a complex one and is not susceptible of solution
                            through a single course of action, through purely temporary programs, or
                            through action solely by the United States. What appears to be required
                            is a comprehensive and concerted approach <pb xml:id="pg_219" n="219"
                                facs="0249"/>to the long-range problems enumerated in paragraph 14–a
                            above. In particular, the action most urgently required of the U.S. is
                            to reduce the barriers to imports and to take other steps which will
                            increase the ability of other nations in the free world to earn dollar
                            exchange.</item>

                    <p>15. The third question is whether present allocations of resources are in
                        proper relationship to the threats facing the United States in Europe, the
                        Far East, and the Middle East and South Asia, to the importance of these
                        areas for U.S. security, and to United States commitments. The following
                        considerations are relevant to this question.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relevant Considerations</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>16. The United States has committed itself to regard an attack on Western
                        Europe as an attack on itself, and a Soviet attack on Western Europe will
                        therefore mean general war. With respect to the cold war, present programs
                        will not greatly improve conditions in the next few years, but instability
                        will probably not constitute a serious problem. With respect to the threat
                        of general war, substantial progress has been and will be made in European
                        rearmament under present programs. Western Europe will probably not have
                        reached a security position by 1955 which would be adequate to assure its
                        defense against a determined Soviet attack. Assurance that Western Europe
                        can be defended in the event of general war, however, is by no means the
                        only measure of the value of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        forces. The growing capability of waging a delaying action is of great
                        importance. For to the extent that Western forces can make a Soviet attack
                        costly (in terms of time, the necessity to concentrate forces, the inability
                        to capture Western Europe’s industry substantially intact, and casualties),
                        they may deter an attack even though they could not successfully hold
                        against it.</p>
                    <p>17. It has also become clear that the Western European countries will not or
                        cannot increase appreciably the proportion of their total output which they
                        are now allocating to defense. The limiting factors, on both the rate of
                        build-up and ultimate force goals are essentially economic and political,
                        and involve such political circumstances as a lesser sense of urgency in
                        some countries than prevails in the U.S. Government, a grave lack of
                        internal political cohesion in France, Italy, and Germany, and the still
                        unresolved rivalry and mutual suspicion between France and Germany, and such
                        economic factors as the precarious state of their balance of payments, the
                        widespread mistrust of currencies, and the low rate of savings. Moreover, it
                        is evident that the fulfillment by 1955 of <pb xml:id="pg_220" n="220"
                            facs="0250"/>force goals which would make the defense of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Area of Western Europe a possibility
                        would require the application of very much greater resources than the U.S.
                        or European governments are now projecting for this purpose. Heavy pressure
                        by the United States in an effort to make the Western European countries
                        increase their defense efforts would probably be counter-productive for the
                        time being. The important thing is to make steady progress.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Middle East and South Asia</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>18. Under present circumstances the threat to the Middle East is primarily a
                        cold war threat. An armed attack on the Middle East could be made only by
                        Soviet forces and is highly unlikely except as one phase of a general war.
                        There is great danger, however, that political and economic conditions will
                        continue to deteriorate and that important areas, such as Iran, might be
                        lost to Communism as a result of this deterioration and of Soviet political
                        warfare. The ability of the Western powers to combat this threat is limited.
                        There is great animosity in the Arab States and Iran toward the West,
                        particularly toward the U.K. and France. There are important steps which the
                        U.S. can and should take, however, to remedy the situation. Certain of these
                        steps can be taken in concert with the Western allies, but the U.S. must
                        reserve its freedom of action to proceed if such a course is best suited to
                        the long-range objectives which we and our allies share.</p>
                    <p>19. There is need for the U.S. to make its interest in the area more explicit
                        and to assume increasing responsibility. On the political and diplomatic
                        front, we must demonstrate clearly and openly that preferential treatment is
                        not to be accorded to Israel over other states in the area and that we are
                        determined that national borders shall be respected. Relatively modest
                        amounts of military end-item assistance would make a valuable contribution
                        to political stability and internal security, particularly in certain of the
                        Arab States. The establishment of a Middle East Defense Organization, when
                        political conditions permit, would be of utility as a means of gaining the
                        political cooperation of the states of the area and encouraging integrated
                        defense planning. Technical assistance and capital assistance in economic
                        development are needed as essential parts of a long-term program. The amount
                        of resources required is not large in comparison with the rest of our
                        security program, although an enlarged Indian economic development program
                        and a program of military assistance to modernize and expand Pakistani
                        forces would be expensive.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">The Far East</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>20. Present programs do not provide adequate security in the Far East against
                        the threats of the cold war, local aggression, or general war. The danger to
                        our interests will remain acute at least <pb xml:id="pg_221" n="221"
                            facs="0251"/>as long as Communist China remains a willing and effective
                        ally of the U.S.S.R. The threats in the Far East are of two kinds: first,
                        that the present fighting in Korea and Indochina (and perhaps Malaya) will
                        increase in intensity and perhaps in extent, and second, that there will be
                        political and economic deterioration in these and other Far Eastern
                        countries. The free world cannot count on any more favorable eventuality
                        than a continuation of the present basic stalemate through 1955, and—in the
                        absence of new initiatives and more telling programs on its part—should be
                        prepared for a deterioration of its position in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>21. There are real opportunities to build increased military strength in the
                        Far East, immediately in South Korea, Indochina and Formosa, and in Japan if
                        existing political obstacles can be overcome. Substantially more resources
                        than are provided for in present programs could be effectively used for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>22. Technical assistance and economic development programs can produce
                        significant results but only over a rather long period of time. There is
                        need for investment funds to develop the resources of the region. This
                        development would assist not only the countries in which the investments
                        were made but also Japan and the Western European countries—by making
                        available larger supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs at lower prices
                        but also by increasing the markets for their industrial production.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. No one of the three major areas outside the Western Hemisphere has
                            yet achieved adequate security against the several threats posed by the
                            Soviet system.</item>
                        <item>b. Europe will be in a better position to resist Soviet military
                            attack and to withstand Soviet pressures in the cold war than either of
                            the other two areas. Western Europe will probably not have reached a
                            security position by 1955 which would be adequate to assure its defense

                            it should attach a high priority to the upward revision of certain
                            specific programs to fill particular defense gaps and should be prepared
                            to support military assistance programs for a number of years to

                        <item>d. There is urgent need for a larger allocation of U.S. economic and
                            military resources to selected countries, in the Middle East and South
                            Asia, particularly Iran, Egypt, India and Pakistan, and for measures
                            which would serve to establish American interests in the area. Such new
                            programs would contribute directly to greater political stability and to
                            a measure of military strength.</item>
                        <item>e. There is similarly an urgent need for a substantially larger
                            allocation of U.S. resources to the Far East, particularly to
                            Indo-china, <pb xml:id="pg_222" n="222" facs="0252"/>Korea, Japan, and
                            Formosa. Such larger programs could provide urgently needed indigenous
                            military forces to help the countries of the area achieve stability, to
                            deter or resist Chinese Communist aggression, and possibly to permit the
                            withdrawal of some Western forces to positions of greater strategic
                            advantage.</item>
                        <item>f. There is also need for additional economic programs for the

                            and foodstuffs and thereby benefit the Western European countries and
                            Japan and strengthen the economic base of the whole free world.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>23. The final question is whether a general increase in the level of free
                        world programs and military forces is required to deal with the several
                        threats. This question is considered in the light of the objectives defined
                        in paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 and further
                        elaborated in paragraphs 5–7.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relevant Considerations</p>
                    <p>[Here follows paragraph 24, discussing the various considerations involved in
                        assessing the general level of security programs.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. A continuation of present programs will not produce the situation
                            of strength required to attain the objectives defined in paragraphs 4–7
                            of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3, nor is it probable that
                            improvements in efficiency of administration or any reallocation of
                            resources within the limits of present programs can bring the Free World
                            to such a situation of strength.</item>
                        <item>b. It follows, therefore, that a selective increase in the level of
                            free world security programs will be required if the objectives defined
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 are to be attained. In
                            previous conclusions of this report, specific increases have been
                            suggested to provide for substantially larger continental defense and
                            civil defense programs and for economic and military aid on an expanded
                            scale to countries in the Middle East and the Far East. The specific
                            additional programs suggested herein would require some increase in
                            total security outlays in the immediate future but the extent to which,
                            if at all, they would involve, after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1954, an absolute increase in such outlays to a rate greater than that
                            projected for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 can not be
                            calculated on the basis of evidence now available. It is clear however,
                            that even with such increased programs the objectives defined in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 could not be fully attained
                            within the next two or three years and that the United States must plan
                            for a long-term effort.</item>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives</p>
                    <p>1. Develop throughout the world positive appeals superior to those of
                        Communism.</p>
                    <p>2. Block further expansion of Soviet power even at grave risk of general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>3. Without unduly risking general war, reduce Soviet power and influence so
                        that they can no longer threaten the peaceful co-existence of all
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>4. Maintain a strong U.S. economy and our fundamental values and
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>5. Develop sufficient free world strength to contain Soviet power
                        geographically or politically so that the internal conflicts of the Soviet
                        totalitarian system will, with positive pressures from us, subsequently
                        cause a retraction of Soviet power and influence and eventually cause that
                        system gradually to weaken and decay.</p>
                    <p>6. Ultimately establish an international system based on freedom and justice
                        as contemplated in the UN Charter.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Methods</p>
                    <p>7. Develop and maintain as long as necessary a state of limited
                        mobilization,—a war readiness capable of deterring Soviet aggression and of
                        achieving rapidly full mobilization if war comes.</p>
                    <p>8. Develop and retain ready capability to inflict massive damage on Soviet
                        war-making capacity, while providing for our nation reasonable military and
                        civil defense and internal security pending full mobilization.</p>
                    <p>9. Encourage all free nations to be on our side; and help those willing and
                        able to help us, to increase their economic and political stability and
                        strength, and, where appropriate, their military capability.</p>
                    <p>10. Encourage and assist the development of indigenous forces and security
                        arrangements to resist local Communist aggression; and be willing and able
                        to participate in collective and, if necessary, unilateral action against
                        such aggression in key areas.</p>
                    <p>11. Promote stability and strength in critical areas of the free world by
                        diplomatic and psychological operations; by international economic policies
                        which stress trade, raw material development, increased capital investment,
                        sound financial relations; and by limited U.S. aid.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_225" n="225" facs="0255"/>
                    <p>12. Systematically and consistently inform the American public and other free
                        people so as to gain their support for our policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>13. Without overestimating the effect or taking undue risks, try to weaken
                        Soviet control over the Satellites and the military potential of the Soviet
                        system.</p>
                    <p>14. Develop a sound negotiating position and be prepared to enter
                        negotiations with the USSR, but recognize that only enforceable agreements
                        are meaningful and that the value of negotiation in the foreseeable future
                        may be primarily to influence world opinion.</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p>4. The atomic explosions in Russia in September 1949 led to a reexamination
                        of the basic policies stated by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4.
                        Although this reexamination was completed prior to the communist aggression
                        in Korea on June 25, 1950, it was not finally approved as policy until

                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68/2 reaffirmed the validity of the

                        that in the light of then and prospective Soviet capabilities the action

                        inadequate, in both timing and scope. It pointed out:</p>

                        <item>a. That unless those programs and plans were strengthened and
                            expedited, America would be vulnerable within the years 1954–1955 to a

                    <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0257"/>
                    <p rend="center">I.</p>
                    <p>If and when the Soviets deem themselves capable of defeating the United
                        States without serious risk to their own regime, they will probably initiate
                        general war. They will also initiate general war if they become convinced
                        that the West is about to attack them.</p>
                    <p>Although there is continuing danger of general war, the most immediate danger
                        facing the United States is that a progressive and cumulative loss of
                        positions of importance to the United States (either as a result of
                        deterioration within the free nations or of communist cold war actions or a
                        process involving both) could eventually reduce the United States, short of
                        general war, to an isolated and critically vulnerable position.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet orbit has formidable and growing military, economic, and political
                        capabilities, including in particular an atomic capability and a possible
                        thermonuclear capability, which will become sufficient in the next few years
                        to damage critically the United States and its allies. Conversely, the USSR
                        is vulnerable to our own developing atomic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The United States and its allies have also notably improved their security
                        position since Korea. The U.S. stockpile of atomic bombs will increase
                        absolutely more rapidly than the Soviet. The United States may soon have a
                        thermonuclear weapon. The free world still enjoys a very substantial
                        superiority in basic productive potential over the Soviet orbit. The orbit,
                        however, is willing and able to devote a higher proportion of its resources
                        to war purposes than the free world.</p>
                    <p>The development of Soviet production potential, together with the
                        increasingly destructive power available to both sides, make it impossible
                        for the free world to assign the same weight as in the past to the economic
                        potential as the determining factor in final victory.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these factors, the strongest deterrent to general war will be
                        the achievement and maintenance by the free world of such an over-all
                        position of strength that the Soviets will not take the risk of challenging
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Although genuine progress has been made in Western Europe, further efforts by
                        these countries and further U.S. assistance will be required to overcome the
                        adverse factors and to assure Europe’s progress toward stability and the
                        achievement of collective defense.</p>
                    <p>Present and threatened communist aggression and subversion in the Far East
                        and Middle East pose immediate dangers to the free world. Adequate measures
                        to cope with the situations in these two areas are not provided by current
                        programs, priorities, and force levels.</p>
                    <p>In short, it appears that the ability of the free world to maintain its
                        position and progress toward its objectives would increasingly depend upon
                        (a) its capacity to stand firm against Soviet political warfare, (b) its
                        willingness and ability to commit appropriate forces <pb xml:id="pg_228"
                            n="228" facs="0258"/>and matériel for limited objectives, and (c) its
                        ability to develop greater stability in peripheral and other areas.</p>
                    <p>Outside the Soviet orbit there is need for increased and more selective
                        political warfare operations by the U.S. and its allies, and for a
                        reexamination of international trade policies. Against the orbit itself the
                        free world should intensify its efforts to weaken Kremlin control over the
                        satellites and the military potential of the Soviet system, while not
                        overestimating the effectiveness of such activities and carefully weighing
                        the risks involved.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>If, in conclusion, the free world develops and maintains such over-all
                        strength that the Soviet orbit cannot further expand its power,
                        geographically or politically, the internal conflicts of the Soviet
                        totalitarian system should themselves cause a retraction and decay of Soviet
                        power. No time limit can be set for achieving this objective.</p>
                    <p>However, in view of the dangers and difficulties facing us in the next few
                        years, a reexamination of the adequacy of current U.S. national security
                        programs, from the standpoint of size, relative priority, and allocation, is

                        increase in world security outlays over the next few years is required to
                        reach a level of expenditure which must then be maintained over a long term
                        before our objectives are attained. U.S. programs should be increased
                        selectively, with more resources applied to the following two in
                        particular:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To provide as a matter of urgency substantially larger U.S.

                            atomic capabilities; and</item>
                        <item>b. To expand military and economic aid to the Middle and Far East, in
                            order to increase the free world’s capacity to deter or counter local
                            communist aggression without reliance solely on the threat of general
                            war.</item>

                    <p>Because of limited capability for covert operations against the Soviet
                        system, however, there should be no further increase at present in the
                        allocation of resources to such operations.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Distribution of resources between U.S. and other
                            military forces.</hi> The increase in continental U.S. military and
                        civil defense programs must come from new resources, to avoid diversion from
                        the build-up of our land, sea, and air offensive readiness, which is our
                        best present defense.</p>
                    <p>Additional intensive research and development in active defense is clearly
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Care should be taken in passive defense to minimize fear and to avoid wasting
                        resources in areas not likely to be attacked. However, as U.S. forces reach
                        planned levels of readiness, a growing share of U.S. military end-items
                        should be allocated to our allies. Allocation and delivery abroad should be
                        governed by the recipient’s ability to use and maintain the material
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>Moderate increases should go to the Middle East and South Asia for local
                        forces, and substantially larger amounts to the Far East.</p>
                    <p>No attempt should be made for a general upward revision of present <gloss

                        ammunition shortages should be filled. However, any attempts to whittle down
                        and postpone <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> goals should be resisted.
                        Steady progress should be sought, and U.S. commitments regularly
                        fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>To permit these increases in foreign military aid, U.S. war reserves must
                        continue to be available, on the grounds that the strain on U.S. forces
                        cannot be reduced nor a U.S. strategic reserve reconstituted until other

                        system based on convertible currencies and non-discriminatory trade. Private
                        and public capital should be encouraged to flow abroad.</p>
                    <p>With public funds grants-in-aid should be extended to countries like Greece,
                        Turkey, Korea, and later Pakistan and Vietnam, where the local military
                        burden is such that the only alternative to financial aid is an increased
                        requirement for U.S. troops. The special economic difficulties of Austria
                        and Formosa will also require grant aid.</p>

                    <p>In general, however, there should be flexibility to shift funds among areas

                    <p>Modest increases in economic and military aid should be allocated to Iran,
                        Egypt, India, and Pakistan, however, for political stability and internal
                        security. In this Middle Eastern area aid programs should be guided by the
                        estimate that the threat there is a cold war threat, since an armed attack
                        on the area could be made only by Soviet forces and is highly unlikely
                        except as a phase of general war.</p>
                    <p>In the Far East substantially larger allocations of U.S. resources should be
                        made at once to Indochina, Korea, Japan, and Formosa. Such increases should
                        provide indigenous military forces for internal stability, for resistance to
                        Chinese communist aggression, and for a withdrawal of some Western forces to
                        more strategic positions. Additional economic programs are needed also in
                        the Far East to stimulate production of raw materials and foodstuffs as a
                        means of strengthening the economic base of the whole free world.</p>
                    <p>13. No conclusion has been reached as to the extent to which these programs
                        should be undertaken in the event additional resources are not made
                        available for our continental U.S. military and civil defenses. Our
                        capability for projecting our power abroad must not be sacrificed by
                        concentrating too heavily on the purely defensive aspects of security should
                        general war occur.</p>
                    <p>14. While the specific additional programs suggested herein would require
                        some increase in total security outlays in the immediate future, the extent
                        to which, if at all, they would involve, after <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        calculated on the basis of evidence now available.</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p rend="center">Some Major Questions Raised by a Review of Approved National
                        Security Policies</p>
                    <p>1. How far can we reduce Soviet power and influence without accepting grave
                        risks of general war?</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_231" n="231" facs="0261"/>
                    <p>2. If we continue to contain Soviet power and build free world strength, will
                        an unbearable stalemate ensue?</p>
                    <p>3. Can we reduce Soviet power and influence without deliberate subversion
                        behind the iron curtain?</p>
                    <p>4. Do existing policies sufficiently weigh or consider the vulnerabilities of
                        the Kremlin regime (such as the indigestive results of swallowing such large
                        areas and populations so rapidly), or the psychological aspects related
                        thereto?</p>
                    <p>5. Should we support any government, even though totalitarian, provided only
                        that it is independent of Soviet control and influence; or should we work
                        only with “democratic” groups?</p>
                    <p>6. Under existing policies and programs will we ever be strong enough to
                        negotiate a lasting agreement? What are the conditions, short of
                        unconditional surrender, on which we would settle? Is there any acceptable
                        temporary accommodation short of ultimate settlement?</p>
                    <p>7. Can the free world with U.S. leadership, develop an international trade
                        and financial pattern which will eliminate the necessity for U.S. aid or for
                        trade with the Soviet bloc?</p>
                    <p>8. Despite our offensive capability, are we carrying out adequate programs
                        for defense against atomic attack?</p>
                    <p>9. In case of general war what conditions, if any, should be placed upon the
                        use of atomic weapons? Under what circumstances, short of general war, might
                        atomic weapons be employed?</p>
                    <p>10. Do we still believe that the Soviets shun war:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Because they believe they can gain their ends otherwise?</item>
                        <item>b. Because of our retaliatory power?</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>11. Should we devote additional resources to carry out our existing policies
                        effectively?</p>
                    <p>12. Should we reallocate our existing resources among the various security
                        programs? How?</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p>During January 1953, three documents were placed before the Executive Branch
                        of the Government which point up continental defense, civil and military, as

                            issuing of a report by this Panel, see pp. 845 ff.</note> The first was
                        prepared in the Government after months of deliberation and with widespread
                        participation in State, Defense (including <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss>), and <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>. The second was
                        prepared for the Government by a large number of private citizens working
                        over a period of almost two years. The third was prepared by two scientists,
                        two educators, and the newly appointed director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

                    <p>The impact of these three studies, taken together, is powerful. They treat of
                        a number of subjects but they converge with striking unanimity on one:
                        continental defense. They convincingly corroborate President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EISENHOWERGADD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statement that the
                        United States stands in greater peril today than at any time in our history.
                        They are not alarmist, yet they stand as a warning that if we do not heed
                        the counsel they contain, we could eventually lose our existence as a free
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141 concludes that our present
                        capability to defend continental United States from atomic attack is
                        extremely limited; that probably 65–85 per cent of the atomic bombs launched
                        by the Soviet Union could be delivered on targets in the United States; that
                        the Soviet Union will possess in the period 1954–1955 a capability to make
                        an air attack on the United States which could represent a blow of “critical
                        proportions”; that a continuation of our continental defense programs, civil
                        and military, at the level of present appropriations involves critical
                        risks; and that basic to the attainment of our objectives is allocation of
                        large “additional” resources to civil and military defense of the continent.
                        The word “additional” is used to indicate that this assignment of resources
                        should not be at the expense of other U.S. security programs.</p>
                    <p>The East River report emphasizes that an adequate U.S. civil defense program
                        cannot be developed without the adoption of military measures sufficient to
                        make it manageable; that means should be developed for detecting an airborne
                        enemy attack at a distance of no less than 2, 000 miles from U.S.
                        continental limits; that we should establish interception and defense in
                        depth in support of the outer warning network with the mission of
                        essentially complete interception and kills so that local defense need deal
                        only with leakage through the defensive net. The East River report estimates
                        that thirty atomic bombs dropped without warning on the most inviting
                        industrial targets in the United States could result in</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_233" n="233" facs="0263"/>
                    <p>25, 000, 000 casualties if the attack came at night, with losses much greater
                        from a daytime attack. It sets out 246 recommendations of measures
                        considered appropriate for the defense of continental United States.</p>
                    <p>The Panel of Consultants on Disarmament reported to the Secretary of State
                        that in the course of their work no problem forced itself upon them more
                        insistently and regularly than that of the defense of continental United
                        States; that the intensive U.S. preoccupation with the development of
                        massive capability of atomic attack is not matched by any corresponding
                        concern for U.S. defense in case of a Soviet attack here; that there is an
                        altogether insufficient emphasis on the importance of the atomic bomb as a
                        Soviet weapon and upon the fact that no matter how many bombs we may be
                        making, the Soviet Union may fairly soon have enough to threaten the
                        destruction of our whole society. The Panel believes that this situation
                        results partly from the pattern of our previous atomic decisions, partly
                        from the natural impact of the sound military doctrine of the offensive, and
                        partly from the simple but unpleasant fact that the atomic bomb works both
                        ways. In summary, the Panel considers it plain that “there is every reason
                        to proceed with greatly intensified efforts of continental defense.”</p>
                    <p>A careful study of these three documents prepared by civil and military
                        authorities, by scientists and businessmen and educators, compels the
                        conclusion that not only should something substantial be done about
                        continental defense but it should be done as a matter of great urgency. Our
                        Republic cannot survive if we do not protect our citizens and our industrial
                        base from atomic blows of critical proportions. Time is in fact of the
                        essence. And the urgency of the situation receives added emphasis when we
                        look ahead to Soviet development of the hydrogen bomb and of
                        inter-continental guided missiles.</p>
                    <p>Our vulnerability in this particular aspect of national security has especial
                        meaning in our foreign relations. As long as continental United States is
                        vulnerable to an atomic attack which could result in 25, 000, 000 or more
                        civilian casualties and in crippling damage to our industrial plant, our
                        choice of action in the conduct of foreign relations is drastically narrowed
                        and our ability to act with vigor and decisiveness gravely reduced. This is
                        the case even though we have the retaliatory capability of meting out
                        terrible punishment in the homeland of the attacker.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d44fn4">A handwritten notation on the source text following the
                            close of this sentence reads: “On the other hand, a decrease in the
                            vulnerability of the American bastion, through continental defense,
                            would have a deterrent effect on the Soviet Union.”</note>

                    <p>The three documents mentioned in this memorandum are especially powerful in
                        their persuasion when taken together. They point to the necessity of the
                        Executive preparing a program for continental defense with vigor and
                        urgency. Meanwhile, because the gravity of this situation is not generally
                        realized on Capitol Hill, the Congress or at least its leadership should be
                        briefed on the problem. There are several reasons for this: (1) it would be
                        in line with the established procedure of Executive-Legislative cooperation
                        in the development of policy; (2) it would enable the Executive to obtain
                        sound counsel from the Congress; (3) it would amount to a sharing of
                        constitutional responsibility in this matter of grave concern to the future
                        of our Nation. The urgency for consultation with members of the
                        Congress—even before an Executive program is fully developed—is that in
                        fairness to them, they should be exposed to this danger in our national
                        security before they go far in making commitments to antithetical
                        propositions.</p>

                    <p>Major Lombardo handed us the final report of the 1952 Summer Study Group
                        dealing with continental defense and, more particularly, <pb xml:id="pg_235"
                            n="235" facs="0265"/>with distant early warning system.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d45fn2">Not printed.</note> This report calls for a line of
                        radar stations in the far North to give distant early warning of the
                        approach of enemy aircraft. Major Lombardo said that this proposal has been
                        severely criticized by the Rand Corporation and is not acceptable to the
                        Army, Navy and Air Force. These three Departments favor the establishment of
                        an early warning line at approximately the 60th Parallel. They are against
                        the line further north, proposed by the Summer Study Group, for three
                        reasons:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) There would be several gaps in the line which could not be closed;
                            (2) This line would be too susceptible to “spoofing”; (3) It would not
                            be possible to back up the line with fighter aircraft.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Major Lombardo explained that the line of the 60th Parallel would not be
                        subject to these disadvantages. Furthermore, he said, the Canadians would
                        cooperate in the establishment of this line, whereas they would not in
                        establishing the far North line, and obviously their cooperation is
                        indispensable.</p>
                    <p>Major Lombardo said, in answer to a question, that the Air Force believes it
                        would be possible thus to carry out the terms of the Policy Statement of
                        December 31, 1952.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">The Policy Statement of Dec.
                            31, 1952 was issued as <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 139; it is
                            scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1952-54v06p1">volume
                                VI</ref>.</note> The line along Parallel 60 would provide 3½ to 4
                        hours warning and could be completed by December 13, 1955, the target date
                        set in the Statement of Policy.</p>
                    <p>He said that the next moves in this project, “Counterchange”, will be: (1)
                        construction of two stations on Canadian soil as soon as permission is
                        given, which we understand will be very soon; (2) the Air Force will study
                        the report of the Kelly Committee which is due at the end of this month; (3)
                        we must agree with the Canadians on the precise location of the line
                        expected to be in the general region of the 60th Parallel.<note n="4"

                            “Probably 65–85 per cent of the atomic bombs launched by the Soviet
                            Union could be delivered on target in the United States,” and he added
                            that the national civil defense “is estimated to be only ten to fifteen
                            per cent effective at the present time, and a continuation of present
                            programs will no more than double this effectiveness by the end of
                            1954.” In order to achieve adequate continental defense, new programs
                            involving investments for additional fighter interceptors, anti-aircraft
                            artillery, guided missiles, hunter-killer naval anti-submarine groups,
                            small radar installations for low altitude coverage, radar picket ships,

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained the several
                        briefs which had been provided as a basis for discussion of this item, and
                        recapitulated the position of the previous administration as being peaceful
                        coexistence with a Soviet Union which had changed to some degree its
                        character.</p>
                    <p>The President explained to the Council the value of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 141 as a legacy from three important members of the
                        previous administration who had no personal interest in having its proposals
                        adopted. From this point the President went on to state that the great
                        problem before his administration was to discover a reasonable and
                        respectable posture of defense. If we can find such a level it may be
                        possible to secure the money and resources necessary to enable the world to
                        reach a decent economic position. In short, it may be possible to figure out
                        a preparedness program that will give us a respectable position without
                        bankrupting the nation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated very
                        emphatically his belief that from now on out this Government must pay its
                        way, and that all major policy recommendations should be accompanied by an
                        estimate of how much it will cost to execute them. Moreover, it was highly
                        desirable that an estimate be prepared of just what resources <pb
                            xml:id="pg_237" n="237" facs="0267"/>will be available from tax sources
                        to this Government over the next ten years. Such an estimate was necessary
                        before we could decide on these major programs for national security. For
                        his part, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        stated that our “take” in goods and services is already over the limit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> seemed not to agree
                        with this latter statement, and pointed out the capacity of the American
                        economy to expand and to meet the obligations imposed upon it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the
                        Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Budget provide a written
                        statement of their position in this respect, since it would enormously
                        facilitate the labors of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff in

                    <p>The Policy Planning Staff was established in May of 1947 by a Departmental
                        Order which defined its functions as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“(1) Formulating and developing, for the consideration and approval of
                            appropriate officials of the Department, long-term programs for the
                            achievement of American foreign-policy objectives.</item>
                        <item>“(2) Anticipating problems which the Department may encounter in the
                            discharge of its mission.</item>
                        <item>“(3) Undertaking studies and preparing reports on broad
                            politico-military problems which the Department may submit for
                            consideration by SWNCC, the Committee of Three,<note n="1"

                                Committee which, prior to the establishment of the National Security
                                Council in July 1947 was one of the chief policy coordinating and
                                recommendatory bodies in the Executive Branch. Reorganized in 1947,
                                SWNCC continued to meet through 1949. The Committee of Three,
                                comprised of the Secretaries of State, War, and Navy met
                                periodically through 1947 to discuss on a more informal level
                                ongoing policy problems. For information on the National Security

                            State.</item>
                        <item>“In the discharge of the above functions, the Policy Planning Staff
                            has no operational responsibility and will not issue directives,
                            instructions, etc., to the operational organizations of the Department
                            or to missions in the field. However, in order to insure a realistic
                            basis for planning close contact shall be maintained between the Staff
                            and operational organizations; and the latter shall be responsible for
                            keeping the Staff informed of their planning activities.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Staff consists of a Director, a Deputy Director, ten members (at present
                        there are nine) and an Executive Secretary. (A list of the present members
                        is attached as an Annex.)<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>With the creation of the National Security Council and the unification of the
                        Services that resulted in the creation of the Office of the Secretary of
                        Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff with a Joint Staff, much of the work
                        of the Policy Planning Staff has centered on political and
                        political-military problems that cut across the responsibilities of various
                        bureaus within the Department or of various departments of the Government
                        and involve matters requiring the attention of officers having general
                        experience rather than specialists in particular areas and fields.</p>
                    <p>An example of the continuing work of the Policy Planning Staff on problems
                        that embrace all aspects of our national power and purposes is the series of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers beginning with <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4 and proceeding through <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        114, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135, and most recently <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141. These papers were largely generated by
                        the State Department through the Policy Planning Staff, working in
                        collaboration with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff organization. Coordination with other interested Government
                        agencies was achieved in the Senior Staff of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> and in the National Security Council itself. This series of
                        papers deals with the broad questions of the building of strength in the
                        free world, the retraction of Soviet power and influence, and the
                        possibilities for combatting local aggression and meeting general war, if it
                        should come. Officers who are familiar with atomic energy and <pb
                            xml:id="pg_239" n="239" facs="0269"/>military matters on a continuing
                        basis, the whole field of foreign policy purposes and the range of available
                        means, are essential to the development of these papers relating to
                        strategic objectives and recommendations for the appropriate allocation of
                        resources. Such officers, of course, must prepare the material with the
                        assistance of specialists in particular areas and fields.</p>
                    <p>Apart from close working relationships with the Military Establishment
                        required in the preparation of broad <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        policy papers, the Director and members of the Policy Planning Staff have
                        been closely associated with the Deputy Under Secretary, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MATTHEWSHF1">Matthews</persName>, in the increasingly wide
                        consultation between the State Department and the Defense Establishment.
                        This consultation includes weekly meetings with the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                        frequent discussions with the Joint Strategic Survey Committee and various
                        committees of the Joint Staff, as well as close and continuing relationships
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NASHFC1">Frank Nash</persName> and the Office
                        of the Secretary of Defense. In addition, the Director and members of the
                        Policy Planning Staff meet on a weekly basis with the representatives of the
                        Director of the Mutual Security, the Mutual Security Agency, and the Defense
                        Establishment to discuss foreign aid and foreign economic matters;
                        participate in the work of the Atomic Energy Subcommittee of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Senior Staff, the Joint State–Defense
                        conversations with the representatives of the British Government and
                        somewhat similar conversations with the Canadian Government; and are in
                        touch with the work of such outside groups as the Center for International
                        Studies at M.I.T., the “East River” project, and the Panel of Disarmament
                        Consultants.</p>
                    <p>It is by these means that a planning staff can develop the general
                        information and background which serve to focus a wide range of interests on
                        the problems of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>While the greater part of the time of the Policy Planning Staff members is
                        spent on the matters I have mentioned above, the work of the Staff also
                        includes the preparation, in collaboration with the geographic bureaus in
                        the Department, of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers that relate to
                        specific countries or areas. The most recent of these papers cover Berlin,
                        South-East Asia, Latin America and Iran. The Policy Planning Staff also
                        prepares papers for use inside the Department on such questions (to select a
                        few recent ones) as alternatives to the European Defense Community should
                        the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> treaty fail of ratification, the use
                        of the United Nations as a forum for the discussion of such problems as
                        Tunisia and Morocco, and the distinctions in foreign policy between
                        intentions, aims and objectives.</p>
                    <p>The Policy Planning Staff prepares other material for Departmental use in
                        connection with international conferences and negotiations, for example:
                        meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers, <pb xml:id="pg_240" n="240"
                            facs="0270"/>the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council,
                        tripartite conferences with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        France, and negotiations on the Middle East Defense Organization, the Suez
                        Canal Zone and the Sudan, the Korean truce talks and the Iranian Oil
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>A further function of the Staff, which arose from the general background its
                        members have developed, involved the preparation and checking of important
                        Departmental and Presidential speeches and statements and the writing of
                        outlines for use in Congressional presentations requiring a general
                        discussion of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>These, I think, are the general categories in which the Staff’s work has
                        fallen in the past. The Director and individual members keep themselves
                        informed on developments in particular areas and fields and participate in a
                        variety of discussions, meetings and committees in the Department. Without
                        such contact with the operating divisions, planning could easily become
                        unrealistic and lead to policy planning papers that merely constituted a set
                        of desirable aims rather than purposes achievable within the limits of
                        means.</p>
                    <p>So far as recommendations with respect to the Policy Planning Staff are
                        concerned, I think what I have said in this memorandum will indicate that I
                        regard the continuance of a Planning Staff as an important element in the
                        State Department contribution to the formulation of national policy and as
                        an important device for providing, within the Department, assistance in a
                        variety of matters that do not fall wholly within the province of
                        specialists.</p>
                    <p>The one specific recommendation I would like to suggest concerns the
                        participation of the Department and the Policy Planning Staff in the work of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. I am sure that a good deal can be
                        done to improve the functioning of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>,
                        but I doubt whether any reorganization of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> will diminish by much the necessity for staff work on
                        national policy in the State and Defense Departments.</p>
                    <p>During the past two years, the Counselor of the Department has represented
                        the Department on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Senior Staff. The
                        Counselor’s assistants have served as his alternates on the Senior Staff and
                        as his representatives on the group known as the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Staff Assistants. The Policy Planning Staff, however, has
                        continued to originate papers for submission to the Council or to review and
                        revise proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers originated
                        elsewhere in the Department.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty in this arrangement arises from the fact that the
                        responsibility of the Policy Planning Staff, which has been intimately
                        involved in the preparation of the papers, cuts off at the point that the
                        papers are submitted to the Council and it does not participate in the work
                        of the Senior Staff or the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff
                        Assistants. It would be possible, of course, to alter this arrangement by
                        combining the functions of the Counselor and the Director of the <pb
                            xml:id="pg_241" n="241" facs="0271"/>Policy Planning Staff or by
                        assigning the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> responsibility to the
                        Planning Staff and giving the Counselor other functions. Perhaps one of
                        these two alternatives would be desirable.</p>
                    <p>I am inclined to believe, however, that there are merits in having some
                        division of responsibilities that should be retained. First, there is the
                        advantage of having available two principal officers of the Department who
                        can be used by the Secretary in dealing with the wide variety of matters
                        that require a generalized background and ability and involve
                        interdepartmental and intergovernmental discussion and conferences. Second,
                        the work of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Senior Staff consumes a
                        very great deal of time and would seriously limit the attention that one
                        officer could give to the other necessary functions of the Policy Planning
                        Staff. I say this on the basis of personal experience, since I served on the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Senior Staff for some time prior to
                        the assignment of the function to the Counselor in 1951.</p>
                    <p>I believe the advantages of the present division of responsibility can be
                        retained and the present difficulties largely obviated by a less drastic
                        change in the arrangements. If the Counselor had as his alternate on the
                        Senior Staff and as his representatives on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Staff Assistants, members of the Policy Planning Staff who
                        had been directly involved in the preparation of the papers submitted by the
                        Department then the process of completing papers for the consideration of
                        the Council itself would be a continuing rather than a broken one, and the
                        work of the Policy Planning Staff would be carried on in the light of full
                        information about the views of other agencies represented on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and expressed in discussions in that
                        forum.</p>
                    <p>In its work with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers and in its other
                        functions, the Policy Planning Staff’s effectiveness and utility depend, of
                        course, on the degree to which the Secretary and the Under Secretary find in
                        such an organization a means of increasing the depth of thought and
                        attention given to policy matters and the degree to which the Director and
                        Deputy Director are in a position to reflect in their guidance of the Staff
                        the assumptions on which the administration wishes policy to be planned.</p>

                    <p>Secret</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1">Nitze</persName> has sent me a copy of
                        his memorandum to you of February 12 regarding the Policy Planning Staff
                        because it contains certain comments and recommendations concerning State’s
                        representation on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Senior Staff which
                        in the past was handled by this office.</p>
                    <p>My only comment on S/<gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> organization is to
                        endorse most heartedly the importance of its continuance with possibly some
                        further clarification as to its functions and responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Before proceeding to the recommendations as to the future organization of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> work in the Department, I think it
                        should be stated that under the past procedures I do not think from my
                        experience that the difficulties in this work arose from the fact “that the
                        responsibility of the Policy Planning Staff, which has been intimately
                        involved in the preparation of the papers, cuts off at the point that the
                        papers are submitted to the Council and it does not participate in the work
                        of the Senior Staff or the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff
                        Assistants.”</p>
                    <p>The chief problem in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> work has not
                        been the discussions in the Senior Staff or the absence of participation
                        therein by members of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>. In the first
                        place, it is standard practice for the Counselor or his deputy to take with
                        him the officers who have in the first instance worked on the preparation of
                        the papers, which has by no means always been the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
                    <p>The chief deficiency of the previous arrangement was rather the difficulty in
                        obtaining expeditiously a State Department position for discussion in the
                        Senior Staff. Once that was done there were no special difficulties that I
                        recall in working the matter out with the other Departments represented on
                        the Senior Staff which would have been materially eased by the participation
                        of S/<gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> in the work of the Senior Staff or the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff Assistants. It is for this
                        reason I am not convinced that if the representation on the Senior Staff is
                        left to the Counselor’s office that the Counselor’s alternate on the Senior
                        Staff and his representatives on the Senior Staff Assistants be members of
                        the Policy Planning Staff. In fact, I believe this would set up a system of
                        dual authority which would be a complicating factor. The Counselor’s
                        assistants in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_243" n="243" facs="0273"/>work would at the same time be
                        under the direction of the Director of the Policy Planning Staff and the
                        Counselor.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the issue is clear. If the argument is made, which indeed
                        has merit, that a division of responsibility is desirable in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> work, then I would think the past
                        procedures and organizational relationships could be maintained with very
                        little change.</p>
                    <p>I think there are powerful arguments in logic and good administration for
                        centering the entire <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> work in the Policy
                        Planning Staff. Under this setup:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The Senior State Member would be the Director of <gloss
                                target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>;</item>
                        <item>(2) S/<gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> would have primary
                            responsibility for the preparation of all <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> papers in consultation with the geographic and other
                            offices of the Department, and in certain problems relating only to one
                            geographic area or one functional office the initial drafting could be
                            assigned by <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> to that office;</item>
                        <item>(3) The Director of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> or his deputy
                            would represent the Department in regard to any papers where the
                            original drafting was to be by an interdepartmental committee;</item>
                        <item>(4) An <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Policy Group might be set
                            up under the chairmanship of the Deputy Under Secretary of State, with
                            the participation of the Director of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>,
                            the Counselor and such Assistant Secretaries as may be appropriate for
                            the subject, in order to ensure that a paper, <hi rend="italic">before
                                it went to the Senior Staff,</hi> represents, in general, the
                            position of the Department of State as a whole and not just one section
                            thereof, i.e., <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>.</item>
                        <item>(5) This same group, with the addition of the Under Secretary and such
                            other officers as he might designate, would be a body to advise the
                            Secretary prior to final action by the National Security Council itself.
                            It is believed that this mechanism would greatly expedite the
                            preparation of papers in the Department of State and would ensure
                            continuity between preparation and handling in the Senior Staff and that
                            any papers going to the Senior Staff represented, in effect,
                            Departmental positions.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The only drawback is the one mentioned in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NITZEPH1"
                            >Nitze</persName>’s memorandum that the Senior Staff meetings are
                        extremely time consuming, but perhaps greater use could be made in these
                        meetings of the Deputy Director of S/<gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> to sit
                        for State—a procedure which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NASHFC1"
                            >Nash</persName> in Defense has very frequently used in connection with
                        Senior Staff meetings.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing suggestions concerning a possibly improved organization of
                        State’s representation and handling of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        matters is obviously based upon the present functions of the National
                        Security Council itself. Should the National Security Council be reorganized
                        in any material sense, this would, of course, affect the entire problem of
                        State representation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Throughout February and early March 1953, the National Security Council
                        continued the review of basic national security policies in relation to
                        their costs begun at the 131st meeting on February 11 (for a memorandum of
                        discussion, see page 236). Briefings were given by the Director of the
                        Bureau of the Budget, and letters concerning the costs of policies were
                        exchanged between the Director and the Secretary of the Treasury.
                        Documentation on these activities is in the Eisenhower Library, Eisenhower

                    <p>I submit my recommendations for making the National Security Council more
                        capable of carrying out effectively its statutory functions. The principal
                        recommendations are summarized at the end of the attached Report (Part
                            IX).<note n="1" xml:id="d49fn1">Part IX is not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Since 20 January 1953, I have participated in the daily work of the Council
                        and its Committees, studied its policy papers and various reports, and held
                        conferences (including three eight-hour round-table discussions) with
                        experienced advisers.</p>
                    <p>The Council, as top mechanism in Government for aiding in formulation of
                        security policies, has a policy-planning function and a supporting staff
                        function:</p>

                        <item>(a) The policy-planning function should be exercised through the
                            Council itself, composed of the highest security advisers of the
                            President, and through a Planning Board (now called “Senior Staff”),
                            composed of top-flight personnel to be appointed by the President from
                            the departments and agencies. The President should appoint on his White
                            House staff a “Special Assistant for National Security Affairs”, who
                            would insure that the President’s views as to policy-planning are
                            carried out, would act as executive officer at Council Meetings, and
                            would preside over the Planning Board. The persons referred to in (a)
                            would be part of and change with the Administration.</item>
                        <item>(b) The supporting staff function should be exercised through a
                            high-calibre, permanent Council Staff, not subject to change with
                            political change. This permanent Staff would furnish both a necessary
                            continuity in highly sensitive matters and also maximum staff assistance
                            to the policy-makers. The Special Assistant to the President would
                            supervise, but not be a member of, this permanent Staff.</item>

                    <p>I wish to retain on this permanent Staff Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1"

                        will provide continuity, effectively operate the staff mechanism, and
                        greatly help in the policy planning.</p>
                    <p>My recommendations call for adding some Staff personnel to perform functions
                        for which no Staff personnel now exist (the six <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Staff “think” personnel being already fully occupied). For
                        a full year, carrying out all my recommendations would increase White House
                        and Council expense by some $65, 000.</p>

                    <p>1. The National Security Act of 1947 establishes: (Title I) the National

                        (Title II) the National Military Establishment. The preamble to the Act
                        declares “the intent of Congress to provide a comprehensive program for the
                        future security of the United States; to provide for the establishment of
                        integrated policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and

                    <p>2. Title I of the Act, titled “Coordination for National Security,” states
                        the <hi rend="italic">functions</hi> of the Council:</p>
                    <list>

                            involving the national security.”</item>
                        <item>b. to perform “such other functions as the President may direct for

                        <item>c. from time to time to “make such recommendations, and such other
                            reports to the President as it seems appropriate or as the President may
                            require.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Title I further states that “it shall, subject to the direction of the
                        President, be the <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> of the Council:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. to assess and appraise the objectives, commitments and risks of the
                            United States in relation to our actual and potential military power, in
                            the interest of national security, for the purpose of making
                            recommendations to the President in connection therewith; and</item>
                        <item>b. to consider policies on matters of common interest to the
                            departments and agencies of the Government concerned with the national
                            security, and to make recommendations to the President in connection

                    </list>
                    <p>3. Other parts of Title I provide that the Central Intelligence Agency is
                        “under the direction of” the Council, and that the Atomic Energy Commission
                        may communicate restricted data to other nations, provided that the
                        President makes a determination based on a “written recommendation” of the
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>4. Explicit or implicit in the governing statute are these basic
                        concepts:</p>

                            recommendations to the President, it aids him to resolve the executive
                            will;</item>
                        <item>c. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> seeks to integrate domestic,
                            foreign, and military policies so as to enable Government agencies to
                            cooperate more effectively in national security matters;</item>
                        <item>d. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> acts, according to Presidential
                            direction, to coordinate more effectively policies and functions of
                            Government agencies relating to the national security;</item>
                        <item>e. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> is concerned with both our
                            actual and our potential military power;</item>
                        <item>f. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> is not limited to areas of
                            agency agreement; on its own initiative, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> may seek out areas of agency conflict or omission to
                            act, so as to present alternative or new courses of action for executive
                            decision.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>5. The Council is a mechanism to aid the President in formulating national
                        security policy. In that area, it should perform whatever functions the
                        President thinks will help him best. It is believed that a proper
                        appreciation and application of the foregoing concepts will make the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> operate effectively. No revision of the
                        statutory statement of functions is required.</p>

                    <p>1. In order to make possible a genuine exchange of ideas and foster free
                        discussion, there should not, as a general rule, be more than <hi

                        does not include Advisers, Observers, and the Special Assistant to the

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Statutory Members.</hi> An ideal statute would provide
                        that the Council should consist of the President, the Vice-President, and
                        such other Members as the President from time to time might designate.
                        However, in view of legislative history and present circumstances, it may be
                        practicable to amend the statute only by (a) eliminating the provision
                        requiring Senate confirmation of persons additionally designated by the
                        President to the Council, (b) adding the Secretary of the Treasury, (c)
                        transferring the Council membership of the Chairman of the National Security
                        Resources Board (which Board is to be merged into <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss>) to the Director of Defense Mobilization. It will be
                        desirable for the immediately ensuing future that the functions of the
                        Treasury, of Mutual Security, and of Defense Mobilization be represented on
                        the Council, either through statutory Membership or standing-request

                        to sit as Participant Members.</p>
                    <p>b. In order to bring to the Council deliberations a fresh,
                        frequently-changing civilian point of view and to gain public understanding
                        of national security problems through the use of civilians of stature, from
                        time to time the President should appoint on an <hi rend="italic">ad
                            hoc</hi> basis one or more Civilian Consultants or small Civilian
                        Committees as informal Advisers to the Council. This mechanism should be so
                        used that no public impression arises that any persons or committees have
                        been interposed between the President and his responsible Cabinet Ministers.
                        Therefore, as a general rule, a Civilian Consultant should not formally
                        participate in a Council Meeting and a Civilian Committee should appear at a
                        Council Meeting only when its report is presented.</p>
                    <p>c. Examples of potential usefulness of Civilian Consultants or Civilian
                        Committees—</p>

                        <item>(1) to consider and report to the Council on some specific new
                            proposal or some long-range general project, after which its report
                            would be reviewed by the departments and agencies concerned.</item>
                        <item>(2) to review for the Council some proposal developed and recommended
                            by the Policy Planning Board.</item>

                    <p rend="center">Part IV. Council Meetings</p>
                    <p>1. A regular Council Meeting time should be established and maintained,
                        except in emergency or when omitted; such as Wednesdays from 10:30 a. m.
                        until luncheon. Special Council Meetings <pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251"
                            facs="0281"/>should be called by the Special Assistant at the request of
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>2. The agenda for a Council Meeting should be determined by the President,
                        acting through the Special Assistant. Selectivity and discretion must be
                        used in composing the agenda.</p>
                    <p>3. Each Statutory and Participant Member and each Adviser should attend every
                        Council Meeting in person. If substitution is necessary, the identity of the
                        substitute should be cleared with the Special Assistant before the Meeting
                        in sufficient time for Presidential consideration.</p>
                    <p>4. If the President is unable to attend a Meeting, he should designate to
                        preside in his place (in priority): The Vice-President; the Secretary of
                        State. The Special Assistant never presides.</p>
                    <p>5. The President as Chairman should lead the discussion at Council Meetings.
                        He should exercise that leadership by asking for views around the table so
                        as to bring out conflicts and so as to create a sense of team participation
                        among those present in making the policy which they must later carry out.
                        The Presidential decision may be announced at a Meeting or upon further
                        consideration of the recommendations made to him at such Meeting.</p>
                    <p>6. Members of the Congress should not be asked to attend meetings of the
                        National Security Council.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Part V. Executive Officers of the Council</p>
                    <p>1. The Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
                        should be the principal executive officer of the National Security Council
                        and should serve as Chairman of the Council’s Planning Board. He should not
                        have status as a Statutory or Participant Member or preside at Council
                        Meetings. He should be appointed by the President on the White House Staff
                        and compensated at $20, 000 a year.</p>
                    <p>2. There should be an Executive Secretary and a Deputy Executive Secretary of
                        the National Security Council, appointed by the President and compensated
                        respectively at $15, 000 and $14, 000 a year. Under the supervision of the
                        Special Assistant, the Executive Secretary should be the head of the <gloss

                                    not the time to undertake the various follow-ups, the Special
                                    Assistant should bring to his attention situations where

                                    report and recommendations, the President should decide whether

                        calibre of the Planning Board personnel and to the amount of time which each
                        Member or Adviser devotes to his Planning Board work. To that end, a Member

                    <p>5. The Special Assistant, as Chairman, should preside at Board Meetings. He
                        should set the frame of reference and analyze the problem at the outset. He
                        should lead the discussion in such manner as to bring out the most active
                        participation by all present and the most expeditious dispatch of
                        business.</p>
                    <p>6. In order for the Board properly to function, each Board Member and Adviser
                        should be prepared promptly to state to the Board the views of his
                        department or agency as to a report being prepared in its final form for
                        submission to the Council.</p>
                    <p>7. Since each Board Member or Adviser must express and stand by his honest
                        views, those views, if substantial conflicts cannot be fairly resolved, may
                        never be suppressed or compromised, but should be reported to the
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>8. The traffic of ideas to the Board may be either (a) from the Council
                        downward for study and report back with recommendations, or (b) from any
                        department or agency, or (c) from any Member or Adviser of the Board. Good
                        ideas may germinate at any level. It is important that the Board be
                        constantly made aware of the matters in which the Council is interested and
                        desires to have worked upon in priority. It is also important that if an
                        idea germinates other than in a department or agency which is concerned with
                        the general area, such department or agency should be consulted in
                        establishing the frame of reference.</p>
                    <p>9. Papers sent up from the Board to the Council for action, if longer than a
                        few pages (which may well be necessary for background material) should be
                        preceded by a summary or the specific recommendations (referring to numbered
                        paragraphs in the longer text).</p>

                        have had the assistance of the Director and Staff of the Bureau of the
                        Budget and of the President’s Advisory Committee on Government
                        Organization.</p>
                    <p>I approve both your letter and the recommendations, and direct that they be
                        circulated promptly to the Council for information and guidance.</p>
                    <p>Please call the special attention of Council Members to Part VI of the Report

                        soon as you conveniently can the names of persons nominated by department
                        and agency heads as Members or Advisers of the Planning Board, who are
                        approved by you, so that I can decide on their appointments and the Planning
                        Board can begin to function. I place great emphasis on the selection of men
                        of high calibre for these positions, able to devote plenty of time to their
                        Planning Board functions; for thereby the Council will be better able to
                        operate promptly and effectively.</p>
                    <p>You will submit the appropriate budget amendments for <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        reduction of expenditures for military assistance in the <gloss

                        budget cuts in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 on the
                        military program, as called for in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Action No. 730–c. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        informed the Council that the forthcoming oral briefing would be given by
                        the Chiefs of Staff, to be followed by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRADLEYGAON1">Bradley</persName> and the Secretary of
                        Defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> also noted
                        that the three Service Secretaries would be on hand to answer any detailed
                        questions which might arise from the presentation.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1">Collins</persName> spoke first on
                        the effect of the proposed cut on Army programs, concluding that the
                        proposed cut would have not only grave military implications for the
                        national security, but would give rise to equally serious political and
                        diplomatic difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FECHTELERAWM1">Fechteler</persName> followed
                        with a description of the effect of the cuts on the Navy program, which were
                        depicted as hardly less serious than for the Army. It might be possible,
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FECHTELERAWM1">Fechteler</persName> concluded,
                        to maintain under these cuts the immediate operational capability of the
                        naval forces in being on D-day, but only at the expense of the sustaining
                        power of the Navy’s forces.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SHEPHERDGLC1">Shepherd</persName>, speaking for
                        the Marine Corps, concluded that the effect of the proposed reductions on
                        the contribution of the <pb xml:id="pg_260" n="260" facs="0290"/>Marine
                        Corps to the national security, was such as to deprive the proposed
                        reductions of any justification.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_VANDENBERGGHS1">Vandenberg</persName> indicated
                        the particular difficulties which the proposed reductions would inflict on
                        the Air Force, since it had been compelled to start out from a lower point
                        than the other services and had the furthest to go in achieving the goals
                        set forth for it. His general conclusion as to the danger of the cut was
                        similar to that of the other Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <p>When the Chiefs of Staff had finished their oral presentation, the President
                        observed that perhaps the Council should have a report as to whether
                        national bankruptcy or national destruction would get us first.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BRADLEYGAON1">Bradley</persName> followed with
                        a short statement dealing first with his own judgment as to the very serious
                        results which could be anticipated from acceptance of the reductions
                        proposed for the military program, as well as the serious effects on our
                        allies of the proposal to cut drastically military assistance for them, as
                        set forth in the Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department presentation was then taken over by Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NASHFC1">Frank Nash</persName>, who
                        commented orally on the memorandum and chart prepared at the President’s
                        request for information on the comparative costs of equipping and
                        maintaining a United States division and certain foreign infantry divisions.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NASHFC1">Nash</persName>’s presentation gave rise
                        to considerable discussion about the “divisional slice”. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1">Collins</persName> explained that the problem
                        of the much larger divisional slice for a U.S. division, as compared to
                        various foreign divisions, was under constant study in the Defense
                        Department and indeed was being constantly reduced.</p>
                    <p>The President betrayed some impatience with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1">Collins</persName>’ exposition of this problem,
                        and said: “Explain it away as you will, the cost of maintaining an American
                        soldier in the field is fantastically higher than the cost of maintaining a
                        foreign soldier.” This fact at any rate is undeniable, said the President,
                        and we have got to do something about it. There might be a good deal in
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s argument
                        that it was cheaper to provide assistance to create and maintain foreign
                        divisions in the field than to go ahead so rapidly in the development of
                        additional U.S. divisions.</p>
                    <p>The last speaker for the Defense Department was Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, who in the first instance
                        warned that the written and oral reports which the Defense Department had
                        provided were not to be thought of as final conclusions or recommendations.
                        Everything that had been discussed would have to be looked at again before
                        the magnitude of the reduction could be determined. The whole problem, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, was
                        extraordinarily difficult, and much of the difficulty arose from the
                        mobilization base concept and <pb xml:id="pg_261" n="261" facs="0291"/>the
                        assumption that you can only have sufficient resources to win a war if you
                        have this mobilization base in being and ready to produce. Not less
                        difficult was the problem of the critical period and the estimate of when an
                        enemy attack might be expected. Both of these problems, thought Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, would have to be
                        looked at carefully again.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the Defense Department presentation, the President
                        turned to General <persName corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1">Collins</persName> and
                        told him that he ought to have had his people provide an estimate to
                        indicate that the impact of the proposed cuts might be considerably less
                        serious if the heavier cuts were planned for 1955 or thereafter, rather than
                        in 1954.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1">Collins</persName>, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_VANDENBERGGHS1">Vandenberg</persName> all replied
                        to the President by pointing out that it was precisely the cut in 1955 which
                        would have the most serious effect on our military capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        for purposes of argument the Council assume for the moment that our
                        permanent posture of defense, beginning with 1956, would be one-half the
                        figure in the <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1">Truman</persName> budget for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, and that further, this posture
                        would have to be held for the next ten years. With this assumption in mind,
                        continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                        will it be easier to build on the basis of the old program up to <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and xhen scale down abruptly, or to
                        begin to scale down with the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget?
                        This seemed the essence of the problem to him and the point to which the
                        Council should address itself.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed
                        serious doubts as to the reality of the antithesis presented by Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, who replied,
                        however, that the only alternative seemed to him to look forward to an
                        unbalanced budget for the indefinite future.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed sympathy for Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s position, and added that
                        if we must live in a permanent state of mobilization our whole democratic
                        way of life would be destroyed in the process.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Budget reinforced Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s arguments with a
                        projection of the deficit figures which lay ahead if the present and
                        projected programs and Treasury receipts continued. With some heat, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> explained to the
                        Council that in raising the issues and suggesting an investigation of the
                        effect on the national security programs of an attempt to balance the
                        budget, he was innocent of any charge that the Bureau of the Budget was
                        attempting to establish foreign and military policy by means of budget
                        restrictions. He had no desire whatever to frame such policy. He was merely
                        looking at the facts which confronted the Bureau of the Budget, and asserted
                        that whatever decision was reached by the Council to solve this dilemma must
                        be based both <pb xml:id="pg_262" n="262" facs="0292"/>on the fiscal and
                        budgetary facts on the one hand and the effects on the national security on
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> could consider himself exonerated from the charges he
                        had mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> reverted to a
                        position which he had taken on the subject at previous Council meetings, by
                        noting the importance of investigating the question of the potential income
                        growth and the capabilities for expansion of the American economy.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s
                        familiar position, the President said that he was glad to defer to Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s political acumen
                        and experience, but he was sure that Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> realized what a terrific
                        problem would be created on the Hill if the present Administration went to
                        the Congress with a program of tax increases instead of tax reductions. It
                        was all the more exasperating, said the President, that as nearly as he
                        could determine, more Americans were travelling de luxe style to Europe than
                        ever before. People were spending money at an extraordinary rate and at the
                        same time yelling about the burden of their taxes. It seemed to the
                        President extraordinarily difficult to get Americans to see clearly the
                        relationship between a balanced budget and decreased taxes, on the one hand,
                        and the threat to the national security, on the other.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> then
                        explained to the Council in some detail the difficulties that the Treasury
                        faced in paying bills to the amount of $3 billion which were coming up on
                        June 30 of this year. Even bonds bearing an interest rate of 3½% apparently
                        would provide only $375 million to pay these imminent debts of the
                        Government. Yet if it proved impossible to finance this $3 billion debt, we
                        would presently find ourselves starting all over again on an inflationary
                        cycle which could only end with a resort to controls and a planned economy
                        along New Deal lines. As the Secretary of the Treasury saw it, the money and
                        resources required by the great security programs which had been developed
                        since Korea to the present time, simply could not be borne by the United
                        States unless we adopted essentially totalitarian methods.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the oral presentations by the Defense Department, and
                        the subsequent discussion by the Council, gave rise to two questions in his
                        mind. The first of these he addressed to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, inquiring whether the
                        Treasury Department had given any thought to setting forth the facts that
                        bore on the situation which the Treasury faced in its efforts to find the $3
                        billion which it would owe on June 30. The President thought that such facts
                        should be made available to the public.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that
                        the Treasury had not as yet undertaken to draft such a report to the people,
                        nor did he feel <pb xml:id="pg_263" n="263" facs="0293"/>that it would be
                        profitable or even possible to make such a report until he was more certain
                        of the direction that the country would take at the beginning of the next
                        fiscal year and after we had got over the hurdle represented by the $3
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>The President said that what he had in mind was that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> make as clear as possible
                        the significance of the immediate problem the Treasury faced in meeting the
                        $3 billion in obligations, but to touch rather more lightly on the
                        long-range implications of continued expenditure at such levels. Perhaps,
                        suggested the President, what he really had in mind was an educational
                        program which would inform the American people as to the philosophy and
                        policy of the former Administration, and what the change of policy which the
                        present Administration hoped to effect really meant. This would at least
                        have the advantage of indicating the great difficulties which the Republican
                        Administration faced in this area.</p>
                    <p>The President directed his second question to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>. This was a reiteration of the
                        point made on several earlier occasions as to the feasibility and
                        desirability of cutting overhead and duplication in the military program.
                        When, asked the President could Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> give him a study of the economies that could be
                        anticipated in this vital area?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> replied by
                        pointing out the difficulty of effecting economies in this area sufficient
                        to meet the problem of assuring the security of the nation and approaching a
                        balanced budget. While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> stated that he was quite certain that economies could
                        be carried out without producing quite such drastic effects on the nation’s
                        security as those which had been described by the spokesmen for the Defense
                        Department, he nevertheless felt compelled to warn that this was far from an
                        easy task.</p>
                    <p>The President adjourned the meeting at 12:45, saying facetiously that the
                            “Williamsburg”<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4">Reference is to the

                    <p>Present at the meeting were the President of the United States, presiding;
                        the Vice President of the United States; the Secretary of State; the

                            >FCDA</gloss> presentation only); the Special Assistant to the President

                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. The Civilian Consultants present were as
                        follows: Messrs. Dillon Anderson, James B. Black, John Cowles, Eugene
                        Holman, Deane W. Malott, David B. Robertson, and Charles A. Thomas.</p>
                    <p>A summary of the discussion at the meeting follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> first briefed the
                        Council members and the Consultants on the program for the all-day meeting
                        and the issues to <pb xml:id="pg_265" n="265" facs="0295"/>which attention
                        should be devoted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> was
                        followed by the Director of the Budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s briefing recapitulated
                        the deficits of the past and present, and the projected deficits for the
                        future in the absence of cuts in the Mutual Security and Defense Department
                        programs. In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> emphasized the need for a decision on these cuts not
                        later than the end of April.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> followed Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>, and in addition to
                        stressing the danger of continued deficits, pointed out the critical
                        situation which would face the Treasury Department on June 30, when it would
                        owe $3 billion and would have no money in the till. This specific situation,
                        concluded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                        emphasized the vital need for a reversal of the previous Administration’s
                        spending policy. Continuation of this policy would bankrupt the free world
                        and force the United States itself to abandon its way of life. We were at
                        the fork in the road and a decision would have to be made.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense then took the floor to reply to the question put to
                        him on March 25 by the President, as to how much the Department of Defense
                        could save annually in overhead and duplication. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> stated that the answer to this
                        question was difficult because it ignored the factor of a real change in
                        policy. His best guess, however, is that elimination of overhead and
                        duplication would result in a saving of $1 billion a year. This saving,
                        cautioned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>,
                        rested on the assumption that the Secretary of Defense would get real help
                        from the committee which was at present studying the reorganization of the
                        Department of Defense. Most of this $1 billion, he concluded, would be saved
                        from reductions in personnel.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then discussed
                        the political repercussions to be anticipated from the carrying out of the
                        estimated reductions for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 in
                        the Mutual Security and Department of Defense expenditures as such
                        reductions were reported to the Council on March 18 and March 25. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that it was
                        the belief of the State Department that global war was not inevitable, but
                        that it remained a real possibility. The greatest danger of such a war would
                        come from Soviet miscalculation of the intentions of the United States or
                        from further free world success in the alleged encirclement of the Soviet
                        bloc, or, finally, from a collapse of the United States rearmament program.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> stated his
                        conviction that it was perfectly possible to protect this country against
                        all these risks. By all odds the greatest single prevention of global war
                        was a strong and vigorous United States—a United States whose capabilities
                        both our friends and our enemies would respect. It further seemed to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> that our
                        potential <pb xml:id="pg_266" n="266" facs="0296"/>strength was of greater
                        significance than our actual strength in being. Beyond this, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out, we must
                        take clear positions so that war could not result from Soviet
                        miscalculations. There must be no repetition of the fuzzy situation in Korea
                        in the spring of 1950, which constituted an invitation to the Soviets to
                        move against South Korea.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> called attention
                        to the statement which had been issued on the occasion of the recent visit
                        of Premier Mayer and his Ministers,<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">For
                            documentation on the visit to Washington of French Premier René Mayer in
                            March 1953, see <ref target="frus1952-54v06p1">volume VI</ref>, and <ref
                                target="frus1952-54v08">vol. XIII, Part 1</ref>, pp. 400 ff.</note>
                        which warned the Communists against assuming that the conclusion of an
                        armistice in Korea would leave them free to intervene against
                        Indo-China.</p>
                    <p>The third factor in preventing global war, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, was a firm policy to hold the
                        vital outpost positions around the periphery of the Soviet bloc. As
                        examples, he cited Japan, Indo-China, India, Pakistan, Iran and <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and he further warned that the loss of
                        any one of such positions would produce a chain reaction which would cost us
                        the remainder. Accordingly, the State Department felt it necessary, short of
                        general war, to avoid losses of key positions to the Communists, who won’t
                        themselves invite a global war, but who will stand ready to pick off all the
                        choice positions offered to them locally by “civil wars”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> found the
                        European situation much improved, but pointed out that many European
                        countries were seriously overextended and were in grave danger of economic
                        or financial collapse. The result of such collapses would be the
                        installation in these countries of governments of the far left. The
                        situation was precarious; internal disintegration was much harder to
                        identify and to meet successfully than an overt act such as a Soviet march
                        across Europe. To prevent such internal disintegration and collapse, thought
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, would
                        presumably require an expenditure in the next fiscal year of some $5 to $6
                        billion in assistance to our allies, though the size of this amount would
                        depend in considerable degree on the final shape of American trade policy,
                        which was now under study. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, thought it almost certain that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> targets would have to be stretched out.
                        It was also likely that several hundred millions more would be required in
                        United States assistance to help the French liquidate the Indo-China affair,
                        if the French finally came up with a vigorous program for that area.</p>
                    <p>Japan, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, was
                        living to a considerable extent off United States expenditures for the
                        prosecution of the Korean war. If and when this war was settled, however, we
                        would need to <pb xml:id="pg_267" n="267" facs="0297"/>give further economic
                        assistance to Japan, though here, too, the amount would depend on American
                        trade policies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that our
                        policy of assistance to India would cost $50 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. $140 million seemed likely for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, though even this amount was
                        sufficiently low to cause much anxiety in the State Department. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> doubted the wisdom of
                        cutting the figure for India much below $100 million.</p>
                    <p>His thorniest problems, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, were represented by Iran and the Arab States in
                        general. These problems were predominantly political in character.
                        Accordingly, no large sums can be spent in these areas at the present time.
                        If, however, peace between Israel and the Arab States should be achieved,
                        the problem of the Arab refugees would have to be liquidated. This would
                        call for a substantial United States contribution as well as added military
                        assistance to the nations of the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>In Turkey, the question was whether the Turks could continue to maintain the
                        military forces they have in being, without assistance from us. We regard
                        the maintenance of these forces as vital to our security, but the burden is
                        excessively heavy for the Turks to bear.</p>
                    <p>The Latin American states, warned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, are a problem which we can never afford to forget.
                        Anti-American forces were on the march in many of these republics, and we
                        might well wake up ten years from now to find that our friends in Latin
                        America had become our enemies. Certainly we could not abruptly cut off aid
                        to Latin America, though a reduction might occur during a transition from
                        loans and grant aid to other kinds of assistance.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        noted that the assistance program for the maintenance by the United States
                        of these outpost positions, while absolutely indispensable, would not call
                        for the expenditure of vast sums. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> believed that the figure of $6 billion a year was
                        probably reasonable, but said that he would defer to Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> on this point.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then turned to
                        ways and means of ending the peril represented by the Soviet Union. This, he
                        said, could be done by inducing the disintegration of Soviet power. This
                        power is already overextended and represents tyrannical rule over unwilling
                        peoples. If we keep our pressures on, psychological and otherwise, we may
                        either force a collapse of the Kremlin regime or else transform the Soviet
                        orbit from a union of satellites dedicated to aggression, into a coalition
                        for defense only. Of course, said the Secretary of State, no one can surely
                        tell, but <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>’s death<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">The death of <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                                >Stalin</persName> had been announced on Mar. 5, 1953.</note>
                        certainly <pb xml:id="pg_268" n="268" facs="0298"/>marked the end of an era.
                        There is no real replacement for <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> the demi-god. The current peace offensive is designed
                        by the Soviets to relieve the ever-increasing pressure upon their regime.
                        Accordingly, we must not relax this pressure until the Soviets give promise
                        of ending the struggle. The amount of dollars this will take will certainly
                        fluctuate, but the American effort must not now be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ briefing, the President contrasted the free world
                        coalition with the Soviet-dominated mass. Since the Soviets are
                        totalitarians, the President pointed out, they could assign whatever
                        proportion of national income they desire to warlike purposes. We, who are
                        dedicated to raising the standards of living for all peoples, are inhibited
                        from such methods. That is what we are up against when we try to match our
                        resources with those of the Soviet bloc, and we should never lose sight of
                        this fact. The President emphatically endorsed Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>’ warning against any relaxation
                        of pressure on the USSR.</p>
                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence then briefed the Council on the general
                        subject of the adequacy and accuracy of intelligence relative to the Soviet
                        Union as the basis on which our policies and programs must in part be
                        developed. After describing the major categories of such intelligence, Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> freely admitted shortcomings of a serious
                        nature. We must remain highly critical of our intelligence effort, he
                        concluded, but we must not be defeatist in the face of the difficulties of
                        securing adequate information.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, particularly of the recent Communist peace moves in
                        Korea in the light of Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ briefing, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> informed the Council
                        that the views of the Consultants with respect to the general problem which
                        had brought them to Washington, would be presented by Mr. Dillon Anderson.
                        While there was near unanimity in the views of the Consultants, others of
                        them desired to be heard after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> had read his written report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName> expressed
                        satisfaction with the briefing which the Consultants had received over the
                        past three weeks on all the general aspects of the basic problem of
                        reconciling an adequate posture of defense with a balanced budget. He
                        recommended much greater candor by the Administration in setting forth to
                        the American people the nature of the Soviet threat, the grave fiscal
                        situation, and the resulting dilemma. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> expressed disapproval of continued deficit
                        financing on the one hand or of increased taxation on the other.. “We have
                        bitten off more than we can chew”, and accordingly, reductions in certain
                        areas must be made. According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, the Consultants did not disagree with the basic
                        security objectives of this Government, but these objectives were so general
                        in nature that the courses of action to achieve <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269"
                            facs="0299"/>them were themselves a matter of policy. For this reason
                        the scope, pace, timing, priority, feasibility, and costs of these policies
                        and programs ought to be re-examined with the greatest care. In general the
                        Consultants believed, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, that the cost of rearmament since 1950 had been
                        excessive, and would continue to be excessive until there was a
                        clarification of the role and the mission of the three Services. There was
                        obviously much duplication here, and it was now time to review a rearmament
                        program which had been initially undertaken in haste and in fear. We should
                        restore confidence to this nation for the long pull, but at the same time
                        immediate savings can be made. Emphasis in this review should be placed on
                        the areas where the United States was strongest, as, for example, in the
                        field of atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>The Consultants had concluded, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, that we had been profligate in the use of military
                        manpower. We should likewise be much more selective in our research and
                        development effort. Scientific programs of the Department of Defense should
                        be placed under an Assistant Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Mutual Security program, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName> warned that the United
                        States should not undertake to shore up the whole non-Soviet world. In
                        according assistance to other nations we should emphasize the concrete
                        defense implications and results. It was plainly impossible to purchase the
                        loyalty and friendship of other nations. In general, thought Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName>, the Mutual Security budget
                        should be revised downward this year in the direction of gradual elimination
                        of all expenditures to which we were not committed.</p>
                    <p>In summary, it was the view of the Consultants, said Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName>, that the National Security
                        Council, should proceed on the assumption that a satisfactory national
                        security posture is compatible with the balancing of the Federal budget in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954. The top figure for the national
                        security programs in the budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954
                        should be $45 billion.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that of course he could not disagree with the dangers to
                        our economy which the Consultants had perceived and emphasized, but the
                        problem, to him, was <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it was necessary to achieve
                        the balanced budget once you agree that you are going to move in that
                        direction. We walk around this problem, complained the President, but it
                        simply cannot be avoided. We can’t suddenly cut off our developing policies
                        and programs for national security. We can’t get out of debt right away. His
                        own belief, said the President, was that we should now show our
                        determination to move in the direction of a balanced budget rather than to
                        make a sudden cut to achieve that objective now.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_270" n="270" facs="0300"/>
                    <p>Mr. Black answered the President with the statement that the Consultants had
                        concluded unanimously that the Administration could balance the cash budget
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954. This could be done in a variety
                        of ways. Until now, everything had been subordinated to getting things done.
                        Now, however, we were in sight of our desired posture of defense, so that we
                        could eliminate this previous wasteful concept. This will require not merely
                        economies, but a stretchout, and even renegotiation of contracts.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed agreement with Mr. Black, but said he wanted to get
                        down to the facts. If a project or program for supplying some military
                        end-item is 60% complete, do we now abandon it, or do we continue it? These
                        are the facts that must be faced. In illustration the President cited the
                        program for large cargo planes, and indicated that the main emphasis should
                        be placed on showing the public that the Administration is definitely moving
                        in the direction of a balanced budget, but that failure to reach that goal
                        at once is the result of policies adopted by the previous
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas expressed agreement with Mr. Black. On curtailing contracts, he
                        complained that until now American industry had been deprived of any sense
                        of sustained military demand for its products. Instead, it had operated on a
                        “get-what-you-can-while-you-can” basis.</p>
                    <p>The President concurred, and expressed the desire that business should become
                        the partner of the Administration in this emergency. He then turned to the
                        specific problem of taxes. What, inquired the President, do we do by way of
                        finding a substitute for the excess profits tax and the increased income
                        tax, both of which will expire this summer? Did the Consultants advocate, he
                        inquired, letting these taxes lapse, or would they prefer to find substitute
                        taxes of a more practical sort to be continued until the Administration can
                        get things on the track?</p>
                    <p>In response to the President’s inquiry, Mr. Cowles said that he believed that
                        the American public was quite unaware of the terrible fiscal mess in which
                        we were involved. They plainly expect much greater budget cuts and tax cuts
                        than it is safe to provide in the face of the threat which the Russians
                        represent. Accordingly, they must be informed more fully about this threat,
                        and the practices of the Government in over-classifying security information
                        must be changed in order that vital information be placed in the hands of
                        the public. Mr. Cowles also added that the Consultants had used “weasel
                        words” in stating their belief that the Administration could achieve a
                        balanced cash budget in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954. What they
                        really meant was that the Administration should head toward this
                        objective.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0301"/>
                    <p>The President answered that there was certainly no point in cutting off your
                        leg because it was injured. While he expressed some agreement with Mr.
                        Cowles’ desire for declassification of security information, he also pointed
                        out the risks involved and the limitation beyond which it was not safe to
                        go.</p>
                    <p>The President then inquired of the Consultants whether they had given any
                        thought to asking for somewhat greater flexibility from Congress in the
                        disposition of funds given to the Mutual Security Administration, so that if
                        at any given moment a certain area required help it could be immediately
                        forthcoming. Would such an approach, inquired the President, be politically
                        possible? In a similar category, continued the President, were the questions
                        of offshore procurement and the breaking down of trade barriers. All of
                        these were politically touchy matters which always aroused the special
                        interest groups.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President replied with the view that the President should emphasize
                        in his dealings with Congress the very close connection between foreign aid
                        programs and our military budget. He should stress that off-shore
                        procurement would enable us to buy our defense at a cheaper rate. If the
                        issue could be presented to Congress in this fashion, the Vice President
                        thought it might change their thinking.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that you
                        could only cut aid if you increased trade; but you can’t do both, as the
                        Congress seems to desire.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> also expressed a
                        keen desire for more off-shore procurement, if only to relieve the dangerous
                        inflationary pressures in this country. Something had got to be done to
                        “cool off” the economy of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> then
                        commented that he seemed to be more radical than the other members of the
                        Council. It was never an agreeable task to cut expenses, but we had got to
                        do it in one of two ways—one, to keep the old programs, but to revise them
                        and effect savings in carrying them out, and two, to make basic changes in
                        the national security policies and programs. For himself, he believed
                        thoroughly in the second course, since our existing program was
                        self-defeating in that it asked industry to produce vast quantities of
                        defense materials at a given time and then suddenly cut off orders.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed doubt as to whether Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s analysis of the
                        self-defeating nature of our present effort was valid. He did not think that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> had
                        distinguished clearly between building up to our security objectives and
                        thereafter maintaining them. In particular, said the President, there was
                        one danger that constantly worried him—lethargy and <pb xml:id="pg_272"
                            n="272" facs="0302"/>inaction in Europe which would allow that Continent
                        to fall into Soviet hands. If the Soviets attempt to overrun Europe, said
                        the President, we should have no recourse but to go to war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> answered
                        that all of this might be true, but that we were at present pushing some of
                        our European allies so hard to build up their defenses that we were forcing
                        them into bankruptcy. Accordingly, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> believed that the National
                        Security Council should set a top limit for defense expenditures for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954—say, $40 billion—and then see what we
                        could buy with that much money.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then raised the
                        question of what risks the American people would be willing to take in order
                        to secure a victory in Korea (which Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> had said would have such a
                        wholesome effect on the economy), or to cut seriously our military and
                        mutual security expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the Administration could probably balance the budget in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 if in the meantime there were no added
                        inflation, but it would be pretty tough to achieve this balance in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 or 1955.</p>
                    <p>The President then spoke his mind on the Korean problem. If, he said, we
                        decide to go up to the strength which will be necessary to achieve a sound
                        tactical victory in Korea—for example, to get to the waist—the Russians will
                        very quickly realize what we are doing. They would respond by increasing the
                        Communist strength in Korea, and, as a result, we would be forced ultimately
                        into a situation very close to general mobilization in order to get such a
                        victory in Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_BRADLEYGAON1"
                            >Bradley</persName> expressed agreement with the President’s thesis.</p>
                    <p>The President then raised the question of the use of atomic weapons in the
                        Korean war. Admittedly, he said, there were not many good tactical targets,
                        but he felt it would be worth the cost if, through use of atomic weapons, we
                        could (1) achieve a substantial victory over the Communist forces and (2)
                        get to a line at the waist of Korea.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the
                        thought that it might now be possible to achieve an armistice in Korea on
                        the basis that the previous Administration had sought in vain. Addressing
                        his question to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ROBERTSONWS1"
                        >Robertson</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> asked if in the circumstances we should accept such
                        an armistice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ROBERTSONWS1">Robertson</persName> avoided an
                        explicit answer, but expressed the general belief of the group of
                        Consultants that the American people would welcome an armistice on this
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the
                        Consultants if they were prepared to answer the question whether we should
                        try for a massive victory in Korea, if it turned out that the Communists
                        dragged out their current <pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0303"/>proposals
                        for perhaps a period of three months and no real armistice was in
                        prospect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ROBERTSONWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the American people would, under the circumstances, support an
                        all-out effort in Korea.</p>
                    <p>There then ensued a discussion of the Mutual Security program and the view of
                        the Consultants that this should be drastically cut unless (a) the current
                        program had been based on prior commitments, or (b) the program had clear
                        defense implications.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName> noted the feeling
                        of the Consultants that many of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        programs appeared to be based on the assumption that you could buy the
                        friendship of other nations and make their economies viable by spending
                        money. This had raised doubts as to the worth of many of the individual
                        country programs.</p>
                    <p>That might be so, said the President, but many of the European nations would
                        certainly have gone Communist had it not been for the money we had spent on
                        them in recent years. We simply cannot afford to let Europe go Communist,
                        warned the President, and while we may not have spent our money
                        intelligently in all cases, we could not now abandon these nations and these
                        programs in Europe. It was the task of our leadership to make them do their
                        jobs better.</p>
                    <p>In response to a query from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>, the President refused to agree with the proposition
                        that the five American divisions in Europe were largely psychological in
                        emphasis. He said that he would have sent more American divisions, not
                        fewer, if the United States had had more available, and he stressed that
                        they were a real physical deterrent to the Soviets and not merely a
                        psychological one.</p>
                    <p>The President further expressed the opinion that the $130 million was a good
                        investment in Latin America if we could be sure that by the expenditure of
                        this amount we could secure the allegiance of these republics to our camp in
                        the cold war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed a
                        willingness to spend even more money to prevent the Latin American republics
                        from falling into Communism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Holman, for the Consultants, stated that he was less worried about the
                        danger of Communism in Latin America than about rampant nationalism.</p>
                    <p>At 12:45 the members of the Council and the Consultants went to lunch at the
                        White House.</p>
                    <p>The meeting reconvened after lunch, and Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> briefed the Council on his
                        tentative views with respect to the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>
                        budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and the general outlines
                        of the civil defense program. These were subsequently transmitted in writing
                        to the members of the National Security Council.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_274" n="274" facs="0304"/>
                    <p>In addition, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName>
                        made two special points—one, that as head of the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1"
                            >FCDA</gloss> he must be made fully aware of all relevant intelligence
                        material, particularly from <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and the
                        Department of Defense, and two, that his agency must be more clearly aware
                        of enemy and United States capabilities if <gloss target="#t_FCDA1"
                            >FCDA</gloss> is to provide realistic leadership to civil defense.
                        Perhaps, said Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1"
                        >Peterson</persName>, this might be accomplished if he sat in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. If not, some other arrangement should be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1"
                            >Peterson</persName>’s briefing, the President observed that Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName>’s report indicated
                        a certain sense of frustration. The President then said that he personally
                        thought Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName>’s job
                        to be of the highest importance and that he would see to it that Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> got the support
                        and the information which was required to do the job that the President had
                        asked him to do.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> was followed
                        by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> of the Atomic
                        Energy Commission, who briefed the Council in the first instance with
                        respect to supplemental information on the program for the development of
                        nuclear power (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 145—The Development of
                        Practical Nuclear Power).<note n="5" xml:id="d52fn5">For documentation on

                        sanitized version of the report of the Consultants on this problem, which
                        had been referred to them by the Council, was then distributed by the
                        Executive Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> noted that the total
                        cost of the pilot plant called for in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        145 was $15 million. It would be impossible, he stated, to erect this plant
                        with the $3 million budgeted at present for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1953 and 1954. In other words, new funds would have to be
                        appropriated if the Government was to build the pilot plant in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954.</p>
                    <p>Although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        repeated his doubts as to the value of “crowding” this project, Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> made clear that he did
                        not wish to see the $15 million for this plant knocked out of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas suggested that instead of spending $15 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 for the pilot plant, the Council
                        recommend at this time the acceptance of the changes in the Atomic Energy
                        Act which Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> had
                        suggested, and then see whether private industry would not undertake to
                        build the plant. This might save the $15 million. If not, the $15 million
                        could subsequently be put back into the budget.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> expressed doubt that
                        private industry would at this time come in on an experimental reactor to
                        the tune of $15 million, but the President expressed approval for going
                        ahead with the process of changing the Atomic Energy Act. He also suggested
                            <pb xml:id="pg_275" n="275" facs="0305"/>that no appropriation beyond
                        that already made should be added until after the legislative changes had
                        been approved.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> was followed by
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>, who briefed
                        the Council on his tentative evaluation of the atomic energy programs for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 and his views of
                        possible reductions in expenditures for these programs. The chief question
                        at issue, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>,
                        was whether $200 million could be saved in the budget for the Atomic Energy
                        Commission. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>
                        stated that North America provides us with approximately one-third of our
                        total requirements of uranium oxide. The other two-thirds of our uranium
                        oxide requirements come from areas vulnerable to enemy attack. In view of
                        our rising weapons objectives, it was therefore plain to Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> that it was necessary to go
                        on with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>’s program for construction
                        of plants for the production of plutonium. In short, it would be impossible
                        to reduce the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> budget for these two
                        fiscal years with respect to ore resources or weapons requirements.</p>
                    <p>Moving on, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>
                        observed that the normal place to look for savings is in the area of
                        greatest cost. In the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> budget this area
                        was that of plant expansion. The question, therefore, was, could we reduce
                        the program for plant expansion without a major default in the production of
                        weapons. At first blush it seemed possible to cut perhaps one new pile at
                        Hanford and two at Savannah River. But in view of the fact that these plants
                        produced tritium, and also because without them reliance would have to be
                        placed on a single installation, it was obvious that cutting out these piles
                        involved a heavy risk to the national security. Accordingly, Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> was unprepared at
                        this time to recommend cuts in plant expansion expenditures. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> did suggest,
                        however, that it might be possible to reduce the amount of money being
                        expended and projected for the tests of atomic weapons. These tests involved
                        a cost $325 million, and he thought a possible saving might be made in this
                        category. Similarly, he suggested that cuts could be made in the production
                        of dummy weapons used in training. Thirdly, he felt that the security
                        program of the Atomic Energy Commission could be reduced by the device of
                        increasing the degree of security in special sensitive areas, but relaxing
                        it in other less sensitive areas. In the aggregate these items might go far
                        to reach the desired goal, but even in these categories Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> stated that he was not yet
                        prepared to make a positive recommendation, and that further study would be
                        required. He felt it would take sixty days to complete this study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> observed
                        that he hated to give up the idea of abandoning some of the proposed
                        increased production capacity in the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        budget.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_276" n="276" facs="0306"/>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> replied that if you
                        cut out the Portsmouth, Ohio, plant you would be completely dependent on Oak
                        Ridge. What would happen to your U–235 if the Oak Ridge installation were
                        destroyed by air attack or by sabotage? In short, Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> supported Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>’ view that to cut the
                        production capacity program involved too great a risk to the national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas inquired as to the possibility of cutting out the program for
                        producing an atomic aircraft carrier and an atomic-powered plane. If this
                        could be done with safety there would be a saving of $254 million in the
                        first two years.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired, what would we lose? What would go down the drain by
                        way of cancelled contracts? On the other hand, he said, there was certainly
                        good reason to question why we should continue to try to produce two other
                        experimental power plants for use in carriers and aircraft until we saw how
                        the program for the atomic-powered submarine turned out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas said that that was precisely his question.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was not necessary to reach a final decision on this
                        issue today, but that it did not seem to him that any very logical reasons
                        had been set forth for pushing ahead on the atomic carrier and plane
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then raised the
                        question of “enough-ness”, and there ensued a discussion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> estimate of weapons requirements. It was
                        noted that 1959 is the date at which we presently estimate that we will have
                        on hand the weapons which the Joint Chiefs believe we need.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Malott then raised the question of public hysteria with respect to atomic
                        weapons and the danger of atomic attack.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was less concerned about hysteria than about the
                        public complacency concerning which Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> had spoken earlier.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Malott argued that he nevertheless believed that we ought to use a couple
                        of atomic weapons in Korea.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that perhaps we should, but we could not blind
                        ourselves to the effects of such a move on our allies, which would be very
                        serious since they feel that they will be the battle ground in an atomic war
                        between the United States and the Soviet Union.. . .</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of this discussion it became the turn of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> to express his judgment as to
                        the extent to which Mutual Security expenditures could be reduced in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 without serious prejudice to
                        the national security. Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> stated his belief that we could accomplish our
                        objectives with respect to assisting our allies in the context of the new
                        United States policy that seemed to be evolving. In changing the Mutual <pb
                            xml:id="pg_277" n="277" facs="0307"/>Security program to fit the new
                        policy, he stated, it was of the greatest importance that the United States
                        act in an atmosphere of confidence. While the change to the new program
                        should be rapid, it should not be abrupt.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> stated that he
                        felt that the forthcoming program should have the following new emphases:
                        (1) on modern weapons; (2) on sound economies, both for ourselves and for
                        other nations; (3) private capital; (4) increased international trade.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that in
                        the future our programs should involve lessened expenditure of funds but a
                        longer period of commitment for U.S. assistance. While he felt that it would
                        be unwise to cut completely our aid to any area of the free world where it
                        was now being given, he believed that the following changes were necessary:
                        In each critical area to concentrate our aid on correcting the weakest point
                        and strengthening the potentially strongest nation. As examples, Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> gave top priority
                        in Western Europe to France as a critically weak point and to Germany as a
                        potential strong point. With regard to the United Kingdom, Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> predicted that
                        development of off-shore procurement would accomplish wonders and would
                        enable us in a short time to stop grant aid. In the Far East we desired to
                        realize on Japan’s great potentiality, but this would require an Asia-wide
                        approach to foreign trade. In South Asia it was essential to save India, but
                        this would not involve so much vast expenditure as the long-term approach
                        which Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> had just
                        mentioned. In the Near East we should develop Egypt as the point of
                        strength. In Latin America and in Africa we should cut the amount of
                        government aid provided to the area, but greatly increase the role of
                        private capital in the development of backward areas. In so doing, however,
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> warned of the
                        need for increasing the stake of the people of these countries in the
                        development of a sound capitalistic economy.</p>
                    <p>If we indeed followed this emphasis in the Mutual Security programs, Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> believed that we
                        could taper off and cut back on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        force goals. In accomplishing all these things, said Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, what we do in the United
                        States will very directly affect what we do to assist foreign countries. We
                        can only achieve our objectives overseas if we put an end to inflation in
                        the United States. We cannot hope to lead others in the direction we wish
                        them to go unless we ourselves are prepared to do what is necessary to
                        assure a more stable economy and less inflation in the United States.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> stated his
                        belief that it would be possible to reach this new program by January 1954,
                        by which time certain cuts could be made. On this basis we could subtract
                        $1.5 billion <pb xml:id="pg_278" n="278" facs="0308"/>in expenditures for
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget, and subtract $1 billion
                        from the appropriations figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1954.</p>
                    <p>After an exchange between Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> with respect to the discrepancy between the figures
                        stated by Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> in
                        his oral presentation and the figures in his written report,<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d52fn6">For the undated “Summary of the Report of the Director
                            for Mutual Security Pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Action 730–c”, see <ref target="frus1952-54v01p1">vol. I, Part 1</ref>,
                            p. 596.</note> the other members of the Council were asked to give their
                        opinions of the policy and program which Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> had outlined.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State emphasized the importance of the psychological factor
                        abroad. Many people in the European countries have been taught to believe
                        that a Republican administration in the United States would mean a return to
                        isolationism. Any sudden cut might therefore produce panic, and at any rate,
                        said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, along
                        with such reductions in grant aid as those suggested by Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> there must go renewed efforts
                        to increase international trade and to cut tariffs.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President warned the Council that they must think of sentiment and
                        feeling on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress, he said, are often reluctant
                        to make cuts in the Defense budget, but they do like to cut the Mutual
                        Security budget. He believed a cut of only $1 billion in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1">Truman</persName> budget for <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> would be extremely difficult to sell to
                        Congress unless it was presented to the Congress as a new program.
                        Accordingly, he urged that heavy emphasis be placed on the defense
                        implications of the Mutual Security program, so that it might be presented
                        as a means of obtaining our national security objectives at less cost than
                        the United States would have to pay if it produced the men and matériel to
                        secure its defenses.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> and the
                        President both stated their conviction that it was absolutely impossible to
                        pull a single American division out of Europe at the present time. The
                        President said we should never forget that in defending Europe with $6
                        billion of Mutual Security assistance we are getting a very great deal for
                        our money, because we are avoiding the necessity of using our own troops.
                        The money in this program was not merely “giveaway” money. With it we are
                        buying something concrete in terms of U.S. security. The real problem, the
                        President repeated, was to find the economical way to make these European
                        nations perform effectively as our allies.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s briefing, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> was asked to brief
                        the Council on his judgment of the extent to which Defense Department
                        expenditures <pb xml:id="pg_279" n="279" facs="0309"/>could be reduced in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 without prejudicial
                        effect on the national security.</p>
                    <p>At the outset, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        stated that defense-wise the United States was much better off now than it
                        had been three years ago, but to achieve by 1956 the force and readiness
                        goals contemplated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3 would
                        require the Department of Defense to spend $45 billion for the next three
                        years and to spend $40 billion in maintenance in the years that followed.
                        Even so, we would not achieve the force and readiness goals at the dates
                        contemplated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 135/3.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then said that
                        he was working at present on the assumption of a “Floating D-day” instead of
                        a specific date for readiness. On this basis it was possible to achieve
                        expenditure cuts of a notable order: $41 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954 (plus $2 billion for the war in Korea). The $41 billion
                        figure could be progressively reduced in subsequent fiscal years to perhaps
                        $33 billion annually by 1958. Reductions of this order of magnitude and in
                        this time sequence would not substantially affect our strength in being in
                        the next two fiscal years. We would, of course, be less well off in the
                        third and subsequent years.</p>
                    <p>Going on, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        suggested that the following might be considered an acceptable program. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1">Truman</persName> budget for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 called for appropriations of $41
                        billion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        proposed taking $5 billion off this figure, which he thought could be got
                        chiefly from better balancing out of the Defense Department programs and not
                        extending our commitments so far. This would bring us from $41 billion to
                        $36 billion, and we could of course go still lower if it were not for the
                        Korean war. $5 billion out of the <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1"
                            >Truman</persName> budget, however, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> felt to be the maximum that
                        could be cut from a political and psychological point of view. A further cut
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 would result in the conclusion
                        that the United States was abandoning a serious defense effort for itself
                        and its allies. Furthermore, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>, with these cuts we should make every effort to keep
                        the maximum forces in being for two years at least, and he proceeded to
                        outline the probable composition of the forces of the Army, Navy and Air
                        Force on the basis of such cuts as he proposed.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> had summarized to
                        the best of his ability the cuts which seemed reasonable to the Secretary of
                        Defense and to the Director for Mutual Security, the President stated that
                        he was satisfied with the picture which they had presented, and felt that
                        Congress ought also to be satisfied. The proposed solution by Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> was even better than
                        he had hoped for.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_280" n="280" facs="0310"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> noted that the
                        Consultants had earlier expressed a view that the budget could be balanced,
                        in terms of cash expenditures, in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954.
                        Did they now wish to comment on what they had heard from Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowles said it would be magnificent if cuts of the proposed magnitude
                        could be made. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> added that on this basis we would have to
                        contemplate a cash deficit of only $1.5 billion. On the whole this seemed to
                        him not too bad.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that we should certainly not, in the present
                        situation, let the excess profits tax die without a substitute. Indeed, he
                        added, we ought never to commit ourselves to any tax reduction while we are
                        fighting this war.</p>
                    <p>The Consultants were then invited by the President to make their
                        comments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas thought that you could still make certain small savings which in
                        the aggregate could be very significant. As examples he thought such savings
                        could be made in the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> budget and in the
                        money currently being spent on research and development in the Defense
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ROBERTSONWS1">Robertson</persName> felt that the
                        proposed cuts were admirable, and he had no suggestions for improvement in
                        the programs outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANDERSONRB1">Anderson</persName> also expressed
                        satisfaction, and stated the view that a balance of the cash budget in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 might even yet be achieved, since
                        “savings breed savings.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowles likewise expressed wholehearted approval of these presentations,
                        and again stressed the importance of educating the public to the current
                        threat to the national security. This alone, he predicted, would put an end
                        to the yelling for further tax cuts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Black stated his wholehearted approval of the programs.</p>
                    <p>The President stated, in closing the all-day session, that he had been
                        thinking about the great contribution which the Consultants had made to the
                        Administration’s understanding of the problem, and it had occurred to him
                        that it would be desirable if the Consultants were to return to Washington
                        and give us some few more days at about the time that the Administration’s
                        budget went to the Congress. They could then check over the final budget to
                        see what actually had been done in the way of cuts. As the President put it,
                        they could give a kind of spot check of the promises that had been made.
                        Furthermore, in thanking the Consultants for their work the President stated
                        that he wanted them to be apostles of the faith throughout the country. If
                        they really believed that the new Administration was doing its job, then
                        they must go back to their localities and say so.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> summed up as the
                        consensus of the meeting that the over-all policies for national security
                        were on the whole appropriate and reasonable. Second, that we should
                        nevertheless, in carrying them out, approach as rapidly as possible the
                        balancing of the budget. Thirdly, that the means of doing this would involve
                        changing our programs to carry out our policies rather than changing the
                        policies themselves.</p>

                        >Cutler</persName>’s observations, and stated that he believed that what we
                        were contemplating was a very different set of objectives as well as a
                        different program, from those which had been endorsed by the <persName

                    <p rend="center">Condensed Statement of Proposed Policies and Programs</p>
                    <p>The National Security Council, together with its seven Civilian Consultants,
                        held a meeting on 31 March 1953 to review the current basic national
                        security policies and programs in relation to their costs. It was the
                        consensus that the following new policies and programs should be
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Policies</p>
                    <p>1. The survival of the free world depends on the maintenance by the United
                        States of a sound, strong economy. For the United States to continue a
                        course of Federal spending in excess of Federal income will weaken and
                        eventually destroy that economy. As rapidly as is consistent with continuing
                        our leadership in the free <pb xml:id="pg_282" n="282" facs="0312"/>world,
                        and barring an emergency, the United States will annually balance its
                        Federal expenditures with its Federal income.</p>
                    <p>2. Because the United States has commitments and responsibilities which, in
                        the interest of the national security, must be met in the near future, it
                        can approach only gradually a balancing of its Federal budget. But the
                        Administration should frankly state at this time to the people that it is
                        resolved to attain this new objective and how it expects to do so. It should
                        also make clear the grave nature of the Communist threat, and of the
                        resulting fiscal situation, which confronts us.</p>
                    <p>3. So long as there is a state of war in Korea, the United States should not
                        materially reduce the level, though it may change the form, of its Federal
                        taxation.</p>
                    <p>4. While bringing the Federal budget into balance, the United States will
                        continue to maintain over a sustained period sufficient armed forces to
                        defend the United States and assist in the defense of vital areas of the
                        free world. Although the national security program expenditures outlined
                        below for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1955 will not permit attainment of force goals which were
                        set some years ago to meet a specific date for D-day readiness, such
                        expenditures will provide greater force strength than we have today—in the
                        United States, in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and in the Far
                        East.</p>
                    <p>5. Subject to paragraph 1 and 2 above, the United States will continue to
                        assist in building up the strength of the free world; will seek thereby to
                        contain Soviet expansion and to deter Soviet power from aggressive war; will
                        continue to exploit the vulnerabilities of the Soviets and their satellites;
                        all with a view to the ultimate retraction and decay of Soviet power.</p>
                    <p>6. In carrying out paragraph 5 above, the U.S. should:</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149 and explained that Part 1 consisted of
                        a statement of policy, which he suggested that the Council approve after it
                        had discussed the statement. Part 2 consisted of an outline of certain major
                        programs, in which there would doubtless be further changes before the
                        Council was prepared to act. The third part, dealing with the financial
                        aspects of the problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said was under study by the Bureau of the Budget,
                        which would present a new set of figures for the meeting of the Council on
                        April 22.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that several members of the Council would be out of the
                        country for the April 22 meeting, but the President said that they would
                        have to be represented by deputies on the occasion of this meeting, since
                        decisions could not be postponed later than this date.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called for
                        suggestions by the members of the Council as to changes in Part 1 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149 which seemed desirable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that at
                        the request of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C. D.
                            Jackson</persName> a meeting had been held to discuss and agree upon
                        ways and means of announcing the new budgetary levels and the new national
                        security programs to the Congress and the people. It was the view of this
                        meeting that the President should make reference to the new budget in a
                        speech or press conference on or about April 20. Meanwhile, the committee
                        believed that every effort should be made to prevent any leaks as to the
                        content of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149.</p>
                    <p>The Council agreed with this procedure and with the view that <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149 was to be “kept on ice” until April
                        20.</p>
                    <p>Theoretically, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149 was to be regarded as subject to
                        change until April 20.</p>
                    <p>The Council thereupon proceeded to indicate revisions in the wording of Part
                        1, including the addition of phraseology warning against the danger of
                        inflation and pointing out how increased inflation might well ruin the
                        attempt to achieve a balanced budget.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed some
                        concern over the phrase in Part 1, paragraph 5, which spoke of courses of
                        action by the United States “with a view to the ultimate retraction and
                        reduction of the Soviet system to a point which no longer constitutes a
                        threat to the <pb xml:id="pg_289" n="289" facs="0319"/>security of the
                        United States.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        thought that this language sounded much too aggressive, and thought that it
                        should be toned down.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, but Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that
                        anything which seriously infringed on this objective would leave the present
                        Administration advocating policies toward the Soviet Union which, far from
                        being more positive than those of President <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1"
                            >Truman</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACHESOND1"
                            >Acheson</persName>, would be softer.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> also urged that
                        the statement be left substantially as it was.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        withdrew his point.</p>
                    <p>The Council then turned briefly to a consideration of Part 2 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149. On the financial issues and the
                        figures indicating cuts, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> pointed out that he did not regard the figures for
                        cuts in Part 2 as fixed. Rather, they were to him indications of the
                        direction in which the Administration was going, and it might well prove
                        feasible to make further cuts in the programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> confirmed Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s opinion that
                        the figures in Part 2 were not yet firm and would not be until the Council
                        acted after April 20.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that he was
                        not inclined to discuss this part of the paper at the present time, until he
                        had been able to give the report further study in the Defense Department. He
                        did, however, express the opinion that his people in the Defense Department
                        were very concerned about the size of the proposed cuts in the Mutual
                        Security program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 and the
                        effect that such cuts would have on military assistance to our allies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> also agreed on
                        the dangerous character of a reduction of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> program from $8 billion to $6.5 billion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> protested
                        strongly against this view, but the President once more insisted that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> was inexact
                        in describing the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> funds as “giveaway”
                        money. Actually we were buying security with these funds.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting<note n="5" xml:id="d54fn5">For documentation on the Eleventh

                        which would occur before the Administration had finally made up its mind on
                        the figure for the Mutual Security budget, the President suggested that when
                        Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and Mr. <persName

                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting they would find that several of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries would be quite eager to
                        climb down somewhat from the <pb xml:id="pg_290" n="290" facs="0320"/>goals
                        and objectives which had previously been set. It therefore seemed to the
                        President better to agree with these countries on a reduction in their
                        obligations and then say that in the circumstances they did not require so
                        much assistance from the United States. This would be better strategy than
                        for the United States to announce to these countries in the first instance
                        that it proposed to make cuts in the levels of assistance it was projecting
                        for the next fiscal year.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> called attention to the

                        of the Council’s consideration at the last meeting of this statement of

                        for approval of the paper and direction to the Planning Board to use it as a

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> further informed the
                        Council that the Secretary of State, before his departure for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, had sent a letter to the
                        President expressing the hope of himself, the Secretary of Defense and the
                        Secretary of the Treasury that no further cuts would be made in the major
                        security programs by the Council, and that the Council would avoid imposing
                        too much rigidity on the programs set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 149/1.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> informed the
                        Council of a number of changes in the wording of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 149/1 which had resulted from his meeting with the
                        President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName> at their
                        briefing earlier that morning. He explained that the President had been
                        desirous of removing the tabular statement of estimated levels of
                        expenditure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, 1955 and 1956 which
                        appeared on page 11, on the ground that such precise figures might be
                        construed by the Congress as ironclad promises which subsequently the heads
                        of the executive departments might find it difficult to keep.</p>
                    <p>The President himself intervened to state that he did not want the
                        responsible members of the Executive branch to make iron-clad commitments to
                        the Congress on expenditure levels since, if changes later proved necessary,
                        the heads of these agencies would be crucified for having failed to live up
                        to the letter of their promises.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> also stated that a
                        letter had been received from the Secretary of Defense, recommending that
                        the proposal to postpone and stretch out the large ship reactor program and
                        the aircraft nuclear propulsion program should be changed to call for the
                        complete elimination of these two programs, with the result that further
                        savings could be made in the Atomic Energy Commission’s program for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that a decision by the
                        Council on this recommendation would be in order, as would be a decision on
                        the suggestion of the Secretary of Defense as to the desirability of a
                        careful review of weapons requirements. If these could be stretched out or
                        lowered, it would be possible for the Atomic Energy Commission to effect
                        still further savings.</p>
                    <p>In summarizing his introductory remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said that he presumed that as a result of previous
                        consideration by the Council of Part I of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 149/1, he could safely assume that the Council was now
                        prepared to adopt Part I and to direct the Planning Board to proceed with
                        the drafting of a new and more detailed statement of national policy along
                        the lines of Part I.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName>, however, informed
                        the Council that in its present form Part I was unsatisfactory to the
                        Department of State. He therefore suggested that Part II of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/1 be approved by the Council, but that
                        Part I be returned to the Planning Board for revision.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_293" n="293" facs="0323"/>
                    <p>Both the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        stated that they were unable to understand the objections which the State
                        Department found in Part I, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1"
                            >Smith</persName> was requested to clarify these objections.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName> replied that he
                        had no objections to the substance of Part I, but that there were a good
                        many nit-picks and editorial clarifications which the State Department felt
                        would be desirable.</p>
                    <p>After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName> pointed to
                        one or two concrete instances, the President indicated agreement that a
                        certain conditioning of the phraseology of Part I would be desirable. The
                        President therefore suggested that the Council approve Part I in substance
                        with the understanding that certain editorial clarifications would be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>The Council then turned to the consideration of Part II of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/1, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> requested Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> to comment on the Military Program
                        therein set forth.</p>
                    <p>The most vital objective, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>, was to secure authority to cut back on certain
                        portions of the Military Program. He did not envisage any considerable
                        change in the force strength of the Army and Navy as contemplated in the
                        Military Program, but additions would be made to the strength of the Air
                        Force, which he anticipated might reach 106 wings by June 30, 1954. A great
                        deal more time would be needed to refine and elaborate the force levels
                        which could be achieved within the expenditure figures and personnel
                        strengths indicated in the Military Program as set forth in Part II. It was
                        quite possible that as a result of this process still further cuts could be
                        made in the costs of the Defense Department program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> then said that he
                        had at hand a proposed action by the Council on the Military Program which
                        he desired to read to the Council as a basis for action. An important item
                        in this action, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>, was the proposal to eliminate the large ship reactor
                        program and the aircraft nuclear propulsion program instead of merely
                        postponing or stretching out these two programs. The program for the
                        atomic-powered submarine would of course continue.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>, who had been
                        invited by the President to attend the Council meeting, stated that he very
                        much preferred to see these two programs stretched out rather than postponed
                        indefinitely or entirely eliminated.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to the essential differences between reactor
                        designs for powering submarines and for powering aircraft carriers.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_294" n="294" facs="0324"/>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName>, who had likewise
                        been invited to participate in Council consideration of this item, explained
                        the very great difference in design between the two reactors. Of course, he
                        said, if there were no military requirement for these two programs, there
                        was no sense in the Atomic Energy Commission’s going on with them. But, he
                        said, he must warn that the elimination of these two programs would occasion
                        considerable readjustments in the research establishments and laboratories
                        of the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>This argument seemed not to appeal to the President, who expressed his
                        anxiety and concern about the Government’s apparent tendency to monopolize
                        all research activity in this area at the very moment when private industry
                        seemed anxious to move in and employ its own research facilities.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DEANGE1">Dean</persName> stated that
                        he believed that private industry would not be in a position to do much in
                        this field for another five years. Accordingly, if the Government drops
                        these two programs there will be a long time gap which might prove to be a
                        grave mistake.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, stated that he himself was prepared to go along with
                        the recommendation of the Secretary of Defense provided the elimination of
                        these two programs was consistent with the national security. If there were
                        other arguments and considerations, not touching the national security,
                        which indicated the desirability of continuing these two programs, the
                        President stated that he would be quite willing to have these considerations
                        discussed separately with the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>Thereupon, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reverted to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>’ recommendation for
                        the inauguration of a review of military requirements for atomic weapons,
                        and asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> to
                        elucidate this recommendation.</p>
                    <p>The heart of the question, replied Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>, was whether it was reasonable to take a calculated
                        risk and postpone for one year securing the added weapons which would result
                        from the most recent expansion program of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss>. He believed that it was safe to take this risk and that
                        very great savings would result from the curtailment of the expansion
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> expressed
                        concern over the probable length of time which would be required for a
                        review of weapons requirements, which he had been told would amount to 60
                        days. If humanly possible the review, he said, should be completed at a much
                        earlier date.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> promised that he
                        would go as fast as he could, but that the review of weapons requirements by
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff would take time, and that furthermore they must be
                        the final judges of the degree of risk which would be involved in postponing
                            <pb xml:id="pg_295" n="295" facs="0325"/>for an entire year the
                        achievement of the levels of atomic weapons hitherto contemplated.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Bureau of the Budget said that he failed to grasp the
                        arguments against cutting down on the production program of the Atomic
                        Energy Commission. Every other program was being revised and cut, while the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> program continues on a war
                        mobilization basis. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>
                        all this made very little sense.</p>
                    <p>In support of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s point,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> noted that it might
                        very well eventuate that we would not have the force levels to use all the
                        weapons which would be produced by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        program. At a minimum it might be possible to save a billion dollars as a
                        result of this reappraisal of weapons requirements.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName> then said he
                        wished to raise a question as to the interpretation of the statement of new
                        policy with respect to the mobilization base as set forth in sub-paragraph c
                        on page 8.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>, in response to this
                        inquiry, stated that what he sought with respect to the mobilization base
                        was dispersion as a safeguard against surprise atomic attack, but not
                        dissipation. The objective was to compress the mobilization base to ensure
                        continued production of the vital items, rather than to shut down on any of
                        these.</p>
                    <p>The Director of Defense Mobilization queried Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> as to whether there was any
                        implication in this sub-paragraph that we were moving in the direction of a
                        constriction of the base.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> replied that in
                        general the answer was “yes”, although as regards certain specific areas he
                        actually contemplated an expansion of the base. What he really sought, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>, was to correct
                        past errors regarding the mobilization base which had been the result of the
                        emergency and haste, or had been caused by simple mismanagement. We are
                        consolidating and validating the new Administration’s position with respect
                        to the mobilization base.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> then sought
                        reassurance that there was no move to sacrifice the principles of security
                        to those of economy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> gave the requisite
                        assurance, and replied that what he wanted to find out was where we now
                        stood with regard to the mobilization base in order to re-evaluate and
                        consolidate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that in
                        general the statement of policy in Part I of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 149/1 appeared to him eminently sound, but that we must
                        understand precisely how we are going to go about implementing that
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>The President interposed to express hearty agreement with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s statement, and to go on
                        to observe that the discussion was now getting to the point where there
                        would be practical political <pb xml:id="pg_296" n="296" facs="0326"
                        />difficulties. The President prophesied that small business would not like
                        this constriction of the military base.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> referred to his
                        knowledge of small business during a period when he considered himself a
                        small businessman, and expressed the view that a great deal could be done to
                        improve the prospects for participation by small businesses in the
                        mobilization program. This, however, would depend on small business
                        abandoning political maneuvering in favor of a practical plan to ensure
                        adequate participation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> then went on to say
                        that he had another suggestion which he would like to place before the
                        Council for its consideration. It seemed to him that it would be a very
                        sensible move to lump together the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> funds
                        for foreign military assistance with the funds allocated for the U.S.
                        military programs, with the objective of having greater flexibility in the
                        allocation of military end items between the U.S. armed forces and the armed
                        forces of our allies. Of course, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>, it would be necessary for the
                        Congress to appropriate funds separately to the Department of Defense and
                        the Mutual Security Agency. What he meant was that they should pool these
                        funds as they were allocated by the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed approval of this proposal if it proved feasible,
                        pointing out that of course the Congress would appropriate separately to the
                        two departments.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>’ proposal made excellent sense to him also. From the
                        point of view of success with the Congress, we should do everything possible
                        to emphasize the national security aspects of the foreign assistance
                        program, and this would help to give such emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> said that in effect
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>’ proposal seemed to
                        him a means of avoiding Representative <persName corresp="#p_TABERRJ1"
                            >Taber</persName>’s repeated suggestion that military assistance funds
                        should be appropriated directly to the Department of Defense and not to the
                        Mutual Security Agency. As an addition to this proposal by Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> thought that there should be some
                        provision stating that the Defense Department should hold fast control over
                        the expenditure of funds from new appropriations for the Fiscal Year
                        1954.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that it would be impossible to write such a
                        provision as this into the budget itself, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> agreed that this was so. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> thought, however, that
                        this was something that could be advanced by way of argument in the
                        Congressional hearings on the Administration’s budget. It would help, he was
                        sure, to sell the budget to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>In reply, the President reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> with some warmth that there would be a very vociferous
                        minority in the Congress <pb xml:id="pg_297" n="297" facs="0327"/>which
                        would be violently opposed to even the slightest cuts in the budgets of the
                        national security programs. We must certainly support very firmly the
                        reductions which have been agreed upon in this paper, and we must do all we
                        can to help Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, but we should not
                        overlook the influence of this minority group.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> observed that he
                        hated to be regarded as a mere pennypincher. He thought there was real
                        danger in talking so much about simply securing cuts in the appropriations
                        for the national security programs. What we should stress and emphasize is
                        that, as a result of the reorganization of the programs and the departments,
                        cuts would be amply justified without damage to the national security. On
                        the other hand, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> did
                        not feel that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s
                        suggestion would be helpful to him.</p>
                    <p>This concluded the discussion of the Military Program in Part II of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/1, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the Acting Director
                        for Mutual Security to explain the Mutual Security Program as set forth in
                        this report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rand<note n="6" xml:id="d56fn6">
                            <persName>William</persName> M. Rand, Deputy Director for Mutual
                            Security.</note> read to the Council an explanation of this program, and
                        stated that the approach taken by his agency to the problem of making cuts
                        was the best approach that the agency could offer. Indeed, he observed,
                        there might even have to be additional funds for certain special programs
                        over and above the level of $6, 300, 000. Such additional amounts might run
                        between $150 million and $300 million.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Rand had finished speaking, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> explained that the President was not wholly clear as
                        to the $750 million set down on page 16 to provide special weapons in a
                        program to be controlled by the President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rand explained that the new weapons referred to included such things as
                        atomic artillery, guided missiles, and the latest type of aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> expressed the view
                        that control of such a program should remain with the Department of
                        Defense.</p>
                    <p>Since the purpose of this program had not been entirely clear, the President
                        speculated that it might be a cover for some transaction which the Mutual
                        Security Agency desired to hide (even if legitimate). In any event, said the
                        President, it seemed to him that there was quite a leap involved from our
                        previous policy of withholding such weapons from our allies to a new policy
                        of giving them $750 million worth of such weapons. Was this perhaps,
                        continued the President, designed to substitute new weapons for conventional
                        weapons?</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_298" n="298" facs="0328"/>
                    <p>Whatever was the design, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName>, he did not like this new item in the Mutual Security
                        Program, and furthermore, he predicted that the new weapons would not be
                        available to send to our allies.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed with this last statement, and said he was forced to
                        conclude that this was a counsel of desperation, because we couldn’t supply
                        conventional weapons in the amounts which we had promised.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> stated
                        that he desired to discuss the proposed Mutual Security Program in a more
                        general and critical way. He called the Council’s attention to the fact that
                        in former years the Congress had invariably cut the appropriations figure
                        for foreign assistance which came from the executive departments. In spite
                        of this fact, the Mutual Security Agency was actually asking for more money
                        this year than they had asked the Congress for in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1953—$300 million more. To Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> this was politically in-feasible,
                        and he felt that the Mutual Security Agency should take into account the
                        very large unexpended balances for both military and economic aid which had
                        accumulated. The existence of these unexpended funds, said Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>, contrasted very unfavorably with
                        a request for such a large new appropriation for the forthcoming fiscal
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The President said that while the Mutual Security people might have a problem
                        with their unexpended balances, he himself was not certain that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s criticism took into
                        account sufficiently the final objectives of our foreign assistance program.
                        If we undertake now to cut still further on the budget of the Mutual
                        Security Agency it was perfectly plain that we would not achieve these
                        objectives. In fact, continued the President, he was actually astonished
                        that the Mutual Security figure was not larger, in view of what would
                        presently be required for the rearmament of Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> stuck to his guns, and
                        stated that a request for new obligational authority of approximately $4
                        billion, instead of the $6.3 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1953, seemed to him ample to ensure the necessary flexibility in
                        administering foreign military assistance. If we persisted in asking for the
                        larger figure, Congress was certainly likely to cut it to at least $4
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>The President remained unconvinced by these arguments, and again stated that
                        we could not possibly contemplate wasting all the money that we have spent
                        in prior years on military assistance, by casting aside important parts of
                        our program at the very time when they were on the point of completion. This
                        was no genuine economy and made no sense to him.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName> said that the
                        State Department had gone over the Mutual Security Program very carefully.
                        He noted that we had <pb xml:id="pg_299" n="299" facs="0329"/>several
                        obligations with respect to Germany. It would cost $100 million to stockpile
                        the necessary supplies for the City of Berlin. We had other commitments in
                        Germany, and we must commence German rearmament the very moment that
                        ratification of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> agreements made it
                        possible. Nothing had yet been done to offset the alarming rearmament in
                        East Germany, and there was no provision to meet any of these commitments in
                        the present Mutual Security Program. Hence, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName>, he could only conclude that the
                        ceiling on appropriations for Mutual Security would have to be raised rather
                        than lowered. The flexibility of which he had heard so much would have to be
                        up rather than down.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> remained unconvinced by
                        these statements or by the President’s argument that Congress was firmly in
                        favor of the program to rearm West Germany.</p>
                    <p>The President said that while he agreed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> that there had been serious
                        mismanagement by the past Administration and that this was an important
                        reason for the existence of large unexpended balances in Mutual Security
                        funds, this nevertheless did not appear to him to offer an excuse for a more
                        drastic cut in the request for new obligational authority. What it indicated
                        to the President was the need for better management of funds appropriated.
                        Since, he continued, this Administration had agreed to place its budget in
                        the hands of the Congress by the first week in May, it seemed to him best to
                        discontinue discussion of the program at this point and to take it up again
                        at an emergency meeting of the Council when its regular members had returned
                        from Europe. It would then be possible to present to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> the feeling that the
                        expenditure records and the existence of unexpended funds in the Mutual
                        Security Program did not seem to jibe clearly with his request for new
                        obligational authority in the amount of $6 billion.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed thereafter to defer discussion of the Mutual Security Program
                        until another meeting of the Council.</p>
                    <p>The President left the meeting at 12:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>After the President had left, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName> urged the desirability of a more careful review of the
                        matériel requirements which were sent in to <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> by our European allies. In some cases, notably British
                        requests for ammunition, the requirements were fantastically high. There was
                        general agreement with the proposal made by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C. D. Jackson</persName> then raised
                        the question of tactics in presenting the Administration’s program and
                        budget. He asked whether, in view of the decision to postpone action on the
                        Mutual Security Program, the President would still propose to talk the next
                        morning with the majority leaders as scheduled.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_300" n="300" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>The Vice President counseled against such a proceeding, and thought it best
                        to postpone any discussion of the budget with the Congressional leaders
                        until the entire program was ready, particularly if there was any
                        possibility of a further reduction in the appropriations for the Mutual
                        Security Agency. It was highly important, said the Vice President, in view
                        of Congressional sentiment for more drastic cuts in the budget, not to risk
                        Congressional repudiation of the President in the very fields in which he
                        was an expert, namely, the military and foreign assistance fields. Unless
                        the matter were carefully arranged, the Congress might make very drastic
                        cuts in the Defense and Mutual Security Programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> answered that he was
                        in perfect agreement with these and other arguments for postponing the
                        meeting with the majority leaders until a decision had been reached on the
                        whole of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/1. But what, he inquired,
                        would happen when Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> talked tomorrow at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> meeting? Would they not let the cat out of the bag in
                        Europe, and would not the levels of expenditure thereafter be immediately
                        known?</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired how much it would be necessary for Secretaries
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> to reveal at the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> thought that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expected word
                        of the decision at the present Council meeting as to what it was appropriate
                        to reveal to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>, however, pointed out
                        that they would be talking only about expenditure figures for foreign
                        assistance and not appropriation figures, and since the expenditure figures
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 in the Mutual Security Program
                        were not in question and were perfectly acceptable, there would be no
                        problem at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the Vice
                        President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName>, and
                        certain other members of the Council remain behind to discuss with the
                        President the desirability of postponing any discussion with the majority
                        leaders until after the Council considered again the Mutual Security
                        Program.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> called the Council’s
                        attention to the changes recommended by the Planning Board in Part I of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/1, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out the inadvertent
                        omission of a paragraph with respect to assistance to the Near East. Subject
                        to the approval of the Secretary of State, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> desired to insert a paragraph
                        dealing with this area.</p>
                    <p>The Council proceeded to make further changes and clarifications of the text
                        of this report, notably with respect to a proposal by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> that the Air Force be permitted to
                        achieve its reduced personnel ceiling at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1955 instead of June 30, 1954. While Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> noted that this would add $200
                        million <pb xml:id="pg_303" n="303" facs="0333"/>to the Defense Department
                        budget, it was likely to provide us with an Air Force of 114 wings by June
                        30, 1955. Among other advantages, this could greatly assist us in meeting
                        the problem of tactical air support in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, in response to the
                        misgivings noted at the last Council meeting with respect to his desire for
                        new appropriations in the amount of $6 billion despite the existence of
                        considerable unobligated balances, explained that the need for new
                        appropriations of this magnitude for 1954 was to complete programs already
                        en train or commitments long since made. He noted his determination that all
                        unobligated balances would, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, be
                        deducted from the $6.3 billion appropriation. The unobligated balance was
                        now estimated to be about $400 million. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> thought that this proposal
                        would go far to close the gap between <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        and the Bureau of the Budget. The chief obstacle to closing the gap was, of
                        course, the $750 million set aside for the special new weapons program which
                        was to be controlled by the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> explained that this figure had been chosen more or
                        less arbitrarily and out of the air, primarily as a psychological boost to
                        our allies. There had been much discussion of our new weapons, and many of
                        our allies were hopeful that in due course some of these would be made
                        available to them. While admittedly such weapons were not available yet, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> thought that some
                        provision should be made in his budget in the event that they became
                        available and it was decided to give some to our allies. He recalled that
                        emphasis on new weapons was an important part of our new policy with respect
                        to military assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> had consulted with the Defense Department people on
                        this item.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> informed the
                        President that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        was opposed to the inclusion of the $750 million figure, and that he himself
                        was not clear as to the purpose it served. Certainly the weapons did not
                        exist now.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that some
                        figure for new weapons should be included, but thought the present figure
                        too high.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> stated that he was
                        agreeable to any figure which the Council could agree upon, pointing out
                        that it would in any case take some four years to build the type of weapons
                        that he had in mind. He thought it would be bad psychology to reduce the
                        figure too much, and pointed out that in any event the President must
                        approve the use of funds in this category as well as the transfer of these
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>There followed a discussion of offshore procurement, in the course of which
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> expressed a
                        disinclination to defend the figures on this item before the Appropriations
                        Committee. He <pb xml:id="pg_304" n="304" facs="0334"/>was assured by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> that the Mutual
                        Security Agency was fully prepared to justify its proposed military
                        assistance expenditures before the Appropriations Committee.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, however,
                        expressed the view that Defense ought to be willing to state clearly that
                        funds expended for offshore procurement were plainly in the interest of
                        national defense and national security.</p>
                    <p>Logically, said the President, the whole appropriation for national security
                        should be in one lump sum and everybody at this table must so regard it,
                        even though Congress thinks and operates otherwise. In any case, said the
                        President, after it was agreed to reduce the $750 million figure for special
                        weapons to $250 million, he was gratified that we seemed to be approaching
                        fairly close to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s
                        budget objectives.</p>
                    <p>Before adding up the totals, however, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> warned that the State
                        Department wanted $100 million for stockpiling in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> stated that this sum
                        should be added to the $5.8 billion to which his appropriation figure had
                        now been reduced.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, inquired whether this sum could legally be taken out
                        of the $400 million of estimated unobligated balances which Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> contemplated having at the
                        end of the fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested a
                        figure of $50 million for stockpiling in Berlin, with which amount the
                        President expressed agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Council members noted that the <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1"
                            >Truman</persName> budget had now been reduced by $2 billion.
                        Satisfaction was expressed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and other members at the general scale of the
                        reduction.</p>

                        Their Costs</p>
                    <p rend="center">Part I</p>
                    <p rend="center">Statement of Policy</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General</p>
                    <p>1. A vital factor in the long-term survival of the free world is the
                        maintenance by the United States of a sound, strong economy. For the United
                        States to continue a high rate of Federal spending in excess of Federal
                        income, at a time of heavy taxation, will weaken and might eventually
                        destroy that economy. As rapidly as is consistent with continuing our
                        leadership in the free world, and barring basic change in the world
                        situation, the United States will balance its Federal expenditures with its
                        Federal income and will maintain over-all credit and fiscal policies to
                        assist in stabilizing the economy.</p>
                    <p>2. Because the United States has commitments and responsibilities which, in
                        the interest of the national security, must be met in the near future, it
                        can approach only gradually a balancing of its Federal budget. But the
                        Administration should frankly state at this time to the people that it is
                        resolved to attain this new objective and how it expects to do so. It should
                        also make clear the continuing nature of the Communist threat, and the
                        resulting fiscal situation, which confronts us.</p>
                    <p>3. So long as there is war in Korea, the United States should not
                        substantially reduce the level, though it may change the form, of its
                        Federal taxation.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0338"/>
                    <p>4. While bringing the Federal Budget into balance, the United States will
                        continue to maintain over a sustained period armed forces to provide for the
                        security of the United States and assist in the defense of vital areas of
                        the free world. The national security program expenditures outlined in Part
                        II for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1955 will provide greater force strength than we have
                        today—in the United States, in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and in
                        the Far East. Further continuing study will be required to relate this force
                        strength to basic national security objectives.</p>
                    <p>5. Subject to paragraphs 1 and 2 above, the United States will continue to
                        assist in building up the strength of the free world; will oppose expansion
                        by the Soviets and Communist China and deter the power of the Soviets and
                        Communist China from aggressive war; will continue to exploit the
                        vulnerabilities of the Soviets and their satellites; all with a view to the
                        ultimate retraction and reduction of the Soviet system to a point which no
                        longer constitutes a threat to the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>6. In carrying out paragraph 5 above, the U.S. should:</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development of Nuclear Power</p>
                    <p>7. a. The early development of nuclear power by the United States is a
                        prerequisite to maintaining our lead in the atomic field. A program for such
                        early development should be carried forward primarily through private, not
                        government, financing.</p>
                    <p>b. The advantages of private financing are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) To tap the great scientific laboratories of private
                            enterprise;</item>
                        <item>(2) To bring about competition between private and government
                            laboratories with benefit to both;</item>
                        <item>(3) To provide some further dispersal of fissionable material
                            production capacity;</item>
                        <item>(4) To create new industries, new employment, and new sources of
                            taxes.</item>
                        <item>c. For a practicable policy of nuclear power, industry should be
                            permitted (subject to appropriate security safeguards) to:</item>
                        <item>(1) Own and operate nuclear power facilities;</item>
                        <item>(2) Buy or lease fissionable material;</item>
                        <item>(3) Use and transfer fissionable and by-product materials not
                            purchased by the Atomic Energy Commission; and</item>
                        <item>(4) Have more liberal patent rights than presently granted.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Accordingly, immediate positive steps should be taken for legislation along
                        these lines.</p>
                    <p>d. No additional funds for a pilot plant (experimental sodium graphite
                        reactor) should be authorized at this time, other than the approximately 3
                        million presently included in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 and
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budgets.</p>
                    <p>e. It is expected that industry will participate with its own funds and
                        facilities in this program when the recommended legislation is passed.</p>

                        and readiness levels contemplated by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                target="#pg_20">p. 20</ref>.</note> would seem to require an average
                        annual expenditure of $45 billion for the Department of Defense for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955
                        and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, even assuming an important
                        increase in efficiency and effectiveness of personnel. To maintain such
                        forces and readiness for the years immediately following <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 would also seem to require annual
                        expenditures averaging $40 billion. All figures assume no increased
                        inflation. Such levels of expenditure <pb xml:id="pg_310" n="310"
                            facs="0340"/>are inconsistent with the policies proposed in Part I,
                        paragraphs 1 through 5.</p>
                    <p>9. Progress in bringing the military program in line with these policies will
                        be made as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The entire military program, including missions, forces and
                            readiness levels, will not be related to a “specified” date for D–Day
                            readiness and will be reviewed and modified from time to time as the
                            result of periodic recommendations from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in
                            view of changing tactical, strategic, and economic considerations
                            throughout the world. In particular, all missions will be carefully
                            reviewed as rapidly as possible in order to determine whether or not
                            there is any overlapping which unnecessarily commits any of the services
                            to responsibilities which can better be served by another service or by
                            a combination of services as a result of changing capabilities,
                            modernization or more effective planning. This military program assumes
                            a steady improvement in defense capabilities, with a substantial base
                            for full mobilization in the event of all-out war. It is a program that
                            should continue to be sound and livable over a period of years.</item>
                        <item>b. The guide lines with respect to force levels for the Army and Navy
                            will be to retain for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954
                            substantially the combat forces presently in being, with every effort
                            being made to reduce overhead resulting from the inefficient utilization
                            of manpower and at the same time to provide substantially increased
                            modernization of equipment. In the case of the Air Force, substantially
                            increased combat effectiveness will be achieved both through
                            modernization of equipment and by an important increase in the number of
                            combat wings. The exact number of wings to be activated and made combat
                            ready during this period (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954–<gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1956) will be determined by taking into account technical developments,
                            the availability of certain desirable improved aircraft, and the
                            necessity of maintaining a healthy base with respect to the
                            aircraft-manufacturing industry so that its production capabilities are
                            reasonably retained for a number of years. Consistent with what has been
                            said above, and without reducing the number of military personnel
                            allocated to combat units, numbers of military personnel are to be
                            re-phased and adjusted to achieve, as rapidly as possible but no later
                            than the dates specified, a reduction for the Army of 125, 000 (30 June
                            1954), for the Navy and Marine Corps an aggregate of 75, 000 (30 June
                            1954), and for the Air Force of 50, 000 (30 June 1955)—a total of 250,
                            000—from the number reported on 28 February 1953. The number reported on
                            28 February 1953 was: for the Army 1, 495, 000, excluding 2, 244
                            Military Academy Cadets; for the Navy, 802, 936, excluding 6, 452
                            Midshipmen and Naval Aviation Cadets; for the Marine Corps, 242, 300;
                            and for the Air Force, 965, 425—a total of 3, 505, 661, excluding
                            Military Academy Cadets, Midshipmen, and Naval Aviation Cadets.</item>
                        <item>So long as the Korean hostilities continue at substantially the
                            current level of activity the Army and the Marine Corps may retain, out
                            of the reduction stated above, up to 51, 000 and 5, 000 military
                            personnel, respectively, in order to provide the personnel pipeline
                            necessary to support the rotation policy.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_311" n="311" facs="0341"/>
                        <item>c. The mobilization base will include proven and retained capacity to
                            produce as well as a minimum stockpile of material. A careful balance
                            must be worked out between (1) weapons that are immediately required if
                            war occurs and (2) the lead times necessary to produce in quantity
                            weapons of proven design from existing or readily available capacity.
                            Technological progress with respect to new weapons and equipment makes
                            this a desirable policy rather than to risk the stockpiling of end items
                            that deteriorate or quickly become outmoded or obsolete. Insofar as
                            possible it will be the policy of the Department of Defense to utilize
                            commercial items and to take advantage of capacity normally used for the

                        <item>e. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget submitted by the

                            public works as part of the 1954 program and (2) funds to carry the

                            deciding to change the ultimate force and readiness goals approved in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 114/3, it should be possible to
                            reduce the above-mentioned <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget
                            request by a substantial sum, even up to $5 billion, and still cover
                            requirements for Korean combat at approximately current levels as well
                            as public works. This reduction can be made through anticipated
                            intelligent savings in manpower, better stock control, reductions in
                            inventory, and an important reduction in the lead time required for
                            additional commitments, because in many cases capacity has been
                            established and production is flowing. Where new products are being put
                            into production, a careful review of engineering, tooling and production
                            lead time can also result in reduced commitments and the finished
                            products still obtained on time.</item>
                        <item>f. The desirability of keeping cash expenditures in line with cash
                            receipts is recognized. By following the programs outlined in paragraphs
                            a through e above, there should result an increasingly strong posture of
                            defense and the cash expenditure levels estimated below. These
                            expenditure levels can be achieved only by exercising better financial
                            and administrative control, effective balancing of all military
                            programs, and avoidance of any further inflation. They are in part made
                            possible by an estimated reduction of $1.0 billion annually through a
                            clear allocation of work and responsibility, avoiding duplication of
                            effort, and better utilization of manpower.</item>
                        <item>g. By following the foregoing programs, it should be possible to
                            reduce the level of expenditure during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1954 to approximately $43.2 billion (which includes $2 billion extra
                            costs for continuation of the Korean war at substantially the current

                                >ROK</gloss> divisions). It is hoped that in subsequent fiscal years
                            the expenditure levels can be progressively reduced to approximately $40
                            billion during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 and to
                            approximately $35 billion during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956.
                            The level of expenditure in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956,
                            however, is subject to revision after a new study of force and readiness

                    <p>12. To carry out the statement of policy in Part I above, the following
                        actions will be taken with respect to the Atomic Energy Commission
                        Program:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The sixth reactor at Savannah River ($170 million) and additional
                            weapon fabricating facilities ($10 million) will be eliminated, and the
                            estimated cost of the two new Hanford reactors will be substantially
                            reduced ($48.6 million). However, increases will be necessary in the
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 Budget Expenditures in
                            order to construct new facilities for the production of special
                            materials, particularly lithium–6, required for thermonuclear weapons.
                            The net effect of these additions and deletions will be to reduce
                            previous estimated expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1954 by $100 million and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 by $134
                            million.</item>
                        <item>b. As a result of more clearly defining the Atomic Energy Commission’s
                            basic plans for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955, the previously
                            estimated expenditure rate of $2.8 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1955 will be reduced by $172 million.</item>
                        <item>c. Estimated reductions of $14 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1954 and $28.7 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1955 will be effected by savings in the Atomic Energy
                            Commission’s security program, and by assuming a year’s postponement of
                            the large ship reactor program and a stretch-out of the aircraft nuclear
                            propulsion program.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_315" n="315" facs="0345"/>
                        <item>d. As a result of the decision not to construct a sodium graphite
                            pilot plant reactor, reductions in estimated expenditures of $3 million
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and $4 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 will be effected.</item>
                        <item>e. On the basis of a re-examination of the rate of expenditures for
                            all major capital projects, including those in the expansion program, a
                            determination has been made with respect to the minimum rates of
                            expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955 that
                            would permit continuation of the program in accordance with present
                            schedules. Based on this analysis, estimated expenditures for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 will be reduced by $106 million and
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 by $57.5 million. Because it
                            is impossible to predict a reduction in the total ultimate costs of
                            these projects, the effect of this rescheduling of expenditures is to
                            defer the amount of the reductions beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1955. It is recognized that reducing the estimated
                            expenditures to a minimum involves a risk as to our ability to meet
                            construction schedules if contingencies, which may well arise, require
                            increased rates of expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1954 and 1955.</item>

                            >Eisenhower</persName> actively pursued the basic national security
                        policies set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/2. On that
                        day, the President submitted a Special Message to Congress transmitting
                        Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1953 concerning the Department of Defense. At
                        the same time, he held a news conference in which he prefaced questions and
                        answers with a brief statement concerning the future course of national
                        defense policy in relation to cost. The text of the President’s Special

                        Reed (R., Ind.), Chiperfield (R., Ill.), <persName corresp="#p_COLERWS1"
                            >Cole</persName> (R., N. Y.), and Wigglesworth (R., Mass.). The purpose
                        of the meeting, the President stated, was to talk “about the difficulties of
                        the economic situation.” He first read <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        149/2 and spoke of reducing the <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1"
                            >Truman</persName> administration’s fiscal year 1954 budget by $8.4
                        billion. “The President dealt at length with the dual threat facing the
                        United States: the external threat of Communism and the internal threat of a
                        weakened economy. He asserted that the Administration would follow a new
                        policy which would continue to give primary consideration to the external
                        threat but would no longer ignore the internal threat.” The President then
                        stressed the terrible expense of existing “security programs”, alluding
                        specifically to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141 of January 19, 1953
                        (for text, see page 209). He further stated that the policy of his
                        administration would be to seek to avoid weakening the economy while
                        providing adequate security.</p>
                    <p>Following this presentation, administration and Congressional leaders
                        discussed at length the problem of national security policies and programs
                        in relation to cost. Senator Taft “stated his assumption that this meeting
                        had been called to secure the comments of the [Congressional] Leaders, and
                        he said he could not possibly express the deepness of his disappointment at
                        the program the Administration presented today. The net result of it, he
                        thought, would be to spend as much as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1"
                            >Truman</persName> spent. Either there would be a large deficit or
                        Congress would have to levy new taxes. It would be impossible to elect a
                        Republican Congress in 1954 if this were to be the Administration program.”
                        Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">George
                            Humphrey</persName> “expressed his agreement with much of what Senator
                        Taft had said, but he wanted it considered that this had been only a
                        three-month start on the problem, and that the Administration would be
                        keeping on for the next fifteen months.” Senator Taft “rejoined that a whole
                        new study was needed.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said “that was impossible in the three months
                        available.”</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded with a brief discussion of the statement to be made to
                        the press. Senator Taft “preferred Mr. Martin to make the statement in view
                        of his own reservations.” A copy of the nine-page “Notes on the Legislative
                        Leadership Meeting,” held at the White House on April 30 is in the

                    <p rend="center">Continental Defense</p>
                    <p>Continental defense has become imperative for the United States as a
                        consequence of the threat posed by the Soviet development of atomic
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>The first Soviet atomic explosion detected by the United States was in late
                        summer of 1949. Since that date, increasing U.S. attention has been devoted
                        to continental defense, focused principally on: (1) military measures,
                        offensive and defensive, including early warning of the approach of hostile
                        craft; (2) non-military measures, including civil defense, reduction of
                        urban vulnerability, post-attack rehabilitation, and continuity of
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Even before the first Soviet atomic explosion and in anticipation of the
                        event, the Department of Defense began (1947) to prepare an air defense
                        system for the defense of Continental United States and Alaska. This action
                        was initiated by the Air Force in requesting an appropriation for the
                        development of an early warning system. In 1948 and 1949 Department of
                        Defense planning recognized the developing threat, but limited resources
                        prevented substantial effort on a continental defense program. This early
                        air defense planning visualized the need for early warning, radar control
                        and direction systems, anti-aircraft artillery, naval picket vessels, and a
                        fighter-interceptor force.</p>

                        the Soviet Union would possess the military capability of delivering a
                        surprise atomic attack of such weight that the United States must have
                        substantially increased general air, ground, and sea strength, atomic
                        capabilities, and air and civilian defenses to deter war and to provide
                        reasonable assurance, in the event of war, that it could survive the initial
                        blow and go on to the eventual attainment of its objectives.</p>
                    <p>In January 1951 the Federal Civil Defense Administration was established.
                        Shortly thereafter, the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>, the <gloss

                        Project East River to study the problem of continental defense, particularly
                        its civil aspects. The report of Project East River was prepared by a large
                        group of private citizens <pb xml:id="pg_319" n="319" facs="0349"/>working
                        over a period of almost two years. It pointed up the dangers to the United
                        States from Soviet atomic attack, and recommended a number of measures for
                        the defense of continental United States.</p>
                    <p>The impact of Project East River as well as further consideration within the
                        Government of continental defense led to the Statement of Policy of December

                        system capable of providing a minimum of three hours warning should be made
                        operational as a matter of high urgency, with a target date for completion

                        an early warning system were begun immediately with Canada. As a
                        consequence, we have received permission to construct an experimental
                        station on Canadian soil, similar to two we decided to construct in Alaska,
                        and we have begun construction of the three stations. We have also received
                        permission from the Canadians to make surveys, with them, and to recommend
                        the selection of sites for the extension of the system if the experiments
                        prove successful.</p>
                    <p>The Panel of Consultants on Disarmament reported about this time that during
                        their deliberations of several months no problem forced itself upon them
                        more insistently and regularly than that of continental defense; that the
                        intensive U.S. pre-occupation with the development of massive capability of
                        atomic attack is not matched by any corresponding concern for U.S. defense
                        in case of a Soviet atomic attack here; and that “there is every reason to
                        proceed with greatly intensified efforts on continental defense.”</p>

                        probably 65 to 85 percent of the atomic bombs launched by the Soviet Union
                        could be delivered on target in the United States; that a continuation of
                        our continental defense programs, civil and military, at the level of the
                        then existing appropriations involved critical risks; and that basic to the
                        attainment of our objectives is allocation of large additional resources to
                        civil and military defense of the continent.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff gave their views on this subject in a memorandum of
                        March 19, 1953 regarding the proposed reductions in U.S. military
                            expenditures.<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">The memorandum under reference
                            cannot be further identified.</note> They said that growing Soviet
                        capabilities <pb xml:id="pg_320" n="320" facs="0350"/>called for increased
                        resources for continental defense; that there can be “no reduction in the
                        commitment to defend the United States against disaster”; and that,
                        therefore, some modification of the policies pertaining to other areas would
                        be necessary in order to make available the minimum forces for this “primary
                        task”.</p>
                    <p>The latest official guidance on this subject is in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 149/2 of April 29, 1953<note n="6" xml:id="d60fn6">For
                            text, see <ref target="#pg_305">p. 305</ref>.</note> which states that
                        we should increase emphasis on the protection of continental United States
                        from enemy attack, by both offensive and defensive military measures and by
                        non-military measures.</p>
                    <p>Valuable information on continental defense will become available soon from
                        the Kelly Committee and the Edwards Committee which were appointed some
                        months ago to study several aspects of the problem.</p>
                    <p>From the above it is evident that even before the Soviet atomic explosion in
                        1949 there has been an increasing realization of the danger to the United
                        States from Soviet atomic potentialities and of a consequent urgency for
                        continental defense measures. Yet in spite of this, there has been
                        inadequate preparation to meet the danger, and the Soviet atomic stockpile
                        has grown faster than our capacity to protect the homeland from attack.
                        According to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141, our civil defense is
                        now only about ten to fifteen percent effective, and the Soviet Union will
                        possess in the period 1954–1955 a capability to make an air attack on the
                        United States of “critical proportions”.</p>
                    <p>There appear to be four principal reasons for the huge gap between
                        realization of danger and preparation to meet it: (1) there was earlier
                        Soviet development of atomic weapons than had been anticipated, and an
                        under-estimation of general Soviet technological capacity; (2) the
                        realization of danger in the United States has not been intense enough or
                        widespread enough in the Executive branch, in the Congress, or among the
                        people to bring about appropriate action; (3) there has been a general
                        belief that by building a powerful offensive capability we could deter a
                        Soviet attack on the United States; (4) there is apprehension that we might
                        devote more resources to home defense than merited by the security which
                        such a system is capable of providing, and thereby unduly penalize both the
                        deterrent value and the direct defense value of offensive striking
                        power.</p>
                    <p>The urgency of continental defense in National policy, foreign and domestic,
                        is underlined by the realization that the survival of our Republic and the
                        entire free world depends on the protection of <pb xml:id="pg_321" n="321"
                            facs="0351"/>continental United States which provides the mobilization
                        base, the arsenal, the industrial potential and the human resources required
                        to save us all from disaster.</p>
                    <p>To deal with this problem we should implement the policy proposed to the
                        National Security Council for candor on the atomic arms race. There should
                        also be held a briefing of Congressional leaders on this particular subject.
                        In line with the policy of candor, the Congress and the people should be
                        thoroughly informed on a continuing basis of the danger to the United States
                        from atomic attack. Concurrently, there should be public disclosure of
                        programs adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for meeting the
                        danger.</p>
                    <p>As stated above, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/2 wisely provides
                        that we should increase our emphasis on continental defense. The problem is
                        how to do this under the budgetary limitations laid down in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/2, limitations which include among
                        other points a reduction in manpower and resources for the air force.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have argued convincingly that some modification may
                        be required in other policies to make available the minimum forces for the
                        “primary task” of continental defense. We cannot have even this minimum of
                        security under contemplated budgetary limitations and allocations. To obtain
                        the minimum we would have to raise the limitation or make cuts in other
                        major national security allocations.</p>
                    <p>The funds required now to accelerate the building of a more adequate
                        continental defense are not impossibly great. The aim should be to begin a
                        sustained effort in an endeavor soon to reach a point at which we can
                        measurably reduce the risk to the civil population of wholesale slaughter
                        and to our mobilization base of virtually complete destruction. Absolute and
                        total protection is probably impossible. An ideal program would not give
                        absolute protection and would be extremely expensive.</p>
                    <p>Of all aspects of continental defense, early warning of the approach of
                        hostile craft is unique in that it is essential both to military and civil
                        defense. For the military, it is necessary if our interceptors are to get
                        into the air, ground defenses to be alerted, and <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> bases and planes preserved from destruction. In civil
                        defense, it is necessary to enable civilians to take shelter or to be
                        removed from danger areas. Moderate additional funds would make possible the
                        improvement of the present early warning system and greatly increase the
                        probability of detection, identification, and tracking of enemy planes.
                        Distant early warning would cost considerably more. This subject should
                        receive urgent consideration, taking into account the information to be
                        developed by the Joint America-Canadian study group. Distant early warning
                        will become increasingly <pb xml:id="pg_322" n="322" facs="0352"/>important
                        in the near future with the increase in speed of airplanes and the
                        development of longer range guided missiles.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that our present air defense system could destroy between one
                        and twenty percent of the attackers depending upon the tactics and strength
                        of the enemy force. To increase the rate of kills, substantial additional
                        resources are required for interceptors and guided missiles. And, aside from
                        an increased rate of kills, improved air defenses could be expected to
                        adversely affect the accuracy of enemy bombing, thereby further reducing the
                        damage to targets. With greater air defense capabilities, we could exploit
                        more fully the technical capabilities of the warning and control equipment
                        which is in being and programed. Future technical improvements may possibly
                        increase the rate of kills, but it must be recognized that because of the
                        expected increase in enemy weapons and planes over a period of time, the
                        number of his planes over target would still be large and might increase
                        faster than the rate of kills. In fact, although with heavy expenditures in
                        the future we can increase the rate of kills, we cannot now lay down a
                        program that would give complete protection. What we can do by improving our
                        air defenses is to push further into the future the time when the enemy’s
                        capability for delivery could be critical for us.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with the problem of continental defense it is important to
                        recognize the inter-relationship of military defense, offensive striking
                        power, and the civil defense program. These three elements are complementary
                        and mutually supporting. A balanced program will, therefore, include civil
                        defense and other non-military measures. In civil defense, shelters are of
                        paramount importance for the protection of the civilian population. A
                        program that might reach a billion a year for a few years to provide shelter
                        for those persons who cannot be protected otherwise could in conjunction
                        with other programs reduce expected casualties as much as 75%. Another
                        indispensable non-military measure is the reduction of urban vulnerability
                        through spacing and protective construction of industrial plants and other
                        buildings. This is a long-range program and with Government encouragement
                        can be financed largely by industry. Other essential non-military measures
                        are programs for continuity of Government and for post attack
                        rehabilitation, neither of which calls for an extensive outlay of funds.

                            names for such Panel. The Panel should meet for a week or so before May
                            31st, utilizing the Council offices and Staff. T. M. Koons, of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Staff, is available to
                            serve as Executive Secretary for this Panel and for the Teams set up
                            under b.</item>
                        <item>The terms of reference should include directions to seek out all the
                            factors that would go into planning a major campaign: forces needed;
                            costs in manpower, dollars, casualties, world relations; intelligence
                            estimates; time-tables; tactics in every other part of the world while
                            actions were being taken in a specific area; relations with the UN and
                            our Allies; disposition of an area after gaining a victory therein;
                            influencing world opinion; Congressional action required; etc.</item>
                        <item>b. A separate Task Force of 3–5 qualified persons for each Alternative
                            to be explored and presented. The preparation should be as for a War
                            College project, and might be done at the War College, <pb
                                xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0354"/>utilizing also its top
                            personnel and facilities. The National Security Council would furnish
                            whatever authority was necessary for urgent access to any and all
                            material.</item>
                        <item>Each Task Force would work up its Alternative in the same spirit that
                            an advocate works up a case for court presentation. In presenting an
                            Alternative to the National Security Council, visual presentation (maps,
                            charts, oral discourse) would be maximized. If possible, the
                            Alternatives would be presented on the same or successive days in the
                            White House. Target date for presentation should be as near July 1 as
                            possible.</item>

                        President should describe “Solarium” in general terms, and enjoin strict

                            at the same time that some of the measures that you are forced to adopt
                            would tend to lead you toward a garrison state? We don’t want to become
                            a garrison state. We want to remain free. Our plans, our programs,
                            therefore, must conform to the practices of a free people, which means
                            essentially a free economy. That is the problem that, frankly, this
                            administration meets on, discusses, works on, every day of its life.
                            There is no easy problem.”</item>

                    <p>1. A National Security Council directive (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        140), dated January 19, 1953, constituted a Special Evaluation Subcommittee
                        of the Council to prepare a summary evaluation of the net capability of the
                        USSR to inflict direct injury on the United States during the period up to
                        July 1, 1955. The directive and a membership list of the Subcommittee and of
                        the agencies represented thereon are appended.<note n="5" xml:id="d65fn5"
                            >For <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140, see p. 205. The membership
                            list of the subcommittee and of the agencies represented thereon is not
                            printed. The members of the subcommittee and their agencies were: Lt.
                            Gen. Idwal H. Edwards, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> (Ret.),
                            Chairman; Lt. Gen. Harold R. Bull, USA (Ret.), representing the Central
                            Intelligence Agency; W. Barrett McDonnell, representing the
                            Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security; Maj. Gen. Robert M.
                            Webster, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Lish Whiston,
                            representing the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.</note>
                        Enclosure (1) is the report of the Subcommittee.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_330" n="330" facs="0360"/>
                    <p>2. As primary sources of information, the Subcommittee obtained reports from
                        each of the agencies represented by its members. Independently of these
                        reports, the Subcommittee also pursued an intensive study of all aspects of
                        the problem. This study involved consultation with, and oral and written
                        reports from, appropriate military and non-military agencies, and reference
                        to many documents and previous studies relating to the subject. The
                        Subcommittee conferred with the commanders and staffs of the Air Defense
                        Command and the Strategic Air Command, with the Joint Air Defense Board, and
                        with responsible officials of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the
                        Federal Civil Defense Administration.</p>
                    <p>3. Under the terms of reference as construed by the Subcommittee, the
                        enclosed evaluation is restricted to but one aspect of the global problem,
                        viz., Soviet net capabilities against the continental United States and
                        selected U.S. installations and forces outside the United States of major
                        importance to a U.S. air atomic counteroffensive against the USSR during the
                        initial phases of war. This evaluation does not represent a Subcommittee
                        judgment that the USSR will or will not initiate war with the United States
                        during the period under consideration, or that if it does, it would initiate
                        such a war with atomic attack on the continental United States. It does,
                        however, present, as the basis of its evaluation, a feasible course of
                        action and plan of attack within the estimated capabilities of the USSR,
                        which the Subcommittee believes the Soviet might logically pursue if his
                        primary objectives were to inflict maximum damage on the continental United
                        States and at the same time diminish the weight of the retaliatory air
                        attack which the United States could mount against the USSR.</p>
                    <p>4. In approaching the problem of assessing damage, the Subcommittee initially
                        planned to analyze, with exactness, the extent of damage accruing from a
                        given number of weapons on precise targets and target systems. However,
                        accurate assessment of damage resulting from attacks against target systems,
                        such as critical industries, industrial complexes and population centers,
                        can be accomplished only by the preparation of studies of the vulnerability
                        of the targets and target systems which take into consideration the many
                        variables affecting the attacks. Fully adequate basic target vulnerability
                        studies were not in existence and could not be produced in the time
                        available. Likewise, a complete war-gaming procedure under varying
                        conditions of attack would have been of great value, but this also was not
                        possible in the relatively short period <pb xml:id="pg_331" n="331"
                            facs="0361"/>available. Consequently, the estimates of damage submitted
                        are approximations, valid under one set of conditions, with the war-gaming
                        process introduced only to a limited extent in certain phases of the
                        operation as reflected in the attrition rates applied to the attacking
                        force.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>1. To prepare a summary evaluation of the net capability of the USSR to
                        inflict direct injury on the United States for the period up to July 1,
                        1955.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Scope of the Evaluation</p>
                    <p>2. The evaluation considers Soviet net capabilities against the continental
                        United States, including Alaska, and selected U.S. installations and forces
                        outside the continental United States of major importance to a U.S. air
                        atomic counter-offensive against the USSR during the initial phases of war.
                        With this delineation of the scope of the evaluation, the Subcommittee’s
                        consideration is thus confined to only one aspect of the world-wide problem.
                        Accordingly, the effects on the United States which might occur if the USSR
                        adopted different military objectives are not measured. The evaluation
                        covers all possible types of attack, including direct military, clandestine
                        military, and sabotage, physical and non-physical. The evaluation deals with
                        the initial phases of war, during which it is assumed that a major part of
                        the Soviet atomic stockpile would be expended. The Subcommittee has made two
                        other important assumptions which are considered of reasonable validity: (1)
                        that the USSR would be able to launch large-scale air attacks from Soviet
                        bases without warning, and (2) that the continental United States would
                        receive no warning of an approaching air attack other than that provided by
                        the North American continental radar detection system.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>3. If, during the period from mid-1953 to mid-1955, the USSR chose to attack
                        the United States with a view of inflicting maximum direct injury on the
                        continental United States, and on selected U.S. installations outside the
                        United States of major importance to a U.S. air atomic counteroffensive
                        during the initial phases of <pb xml:id="pg_333" n="333" facs="0363"/>war,
                        the course of action within its capabilities which we believe would most
                        nearly accomplish the desired result is:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. An attack on bomber bases in the continental United States and on
                            selected forward and staging air bases and air forces outside the United
                            States, combined with</item>
                        <item>b. The heaviest possible attack with its remaining resources upon
                            major population, industrial and control complexes in the continental
                            United States.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. If the USSR selected this course of action, it would have the net
                        capability of inflicting direct injury on the United States of the following

                                    1955, one-half of which might result in deaths. We believe that
                                    actual casualties would be at an indeterminate lower level,
                                    possibly as low as 50 percent of the above figures.</item>

                                    production in 1953 and two-thirds in 1955. Direct damage as the
                                    result of random destruction of plants probably would be
                                    substantial, but would not destroy a sufficient portion of any
                                    industry or industries to prevent attainment of minimum
                                    essential levels of production of war material and civilian

                                    be subtracted from the total number available for air attack.
                                    Therefore, in assessing over-all damage to the United States, we
                                    have considered the effect of clandestinely-placed atomic
                                    weapons to be broadly equivalent to the effect of the same

                    <p>1. On the basis of the latest agreed intelligence estimates, we have made the
                        following evaluations of Soviet capabilities:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Mass Destruction Weapons</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Atomic Weapons:</hi> The USSR’s stockpile of atomic
                        weapons is estimated to consist of approximately the following numbers of
                        weapons of about 80 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> power:</p>
                    <table rows="2" cols="2">

                        </row>
                    </table>
                    <p>The USSR probably can make weapons of smaller or larger yield than those
                        indicated above and in so doing would increase or reduce the number of
                        weapons in stockpile. We believe that the USSR will not have a deliverable
                        thermonuclear weapon or significant quantities of radiological warfare
                        agents during the period under review.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Biological Weapons:</hi> The USSR will probably possess
                        a capability to produce and disseminate virulent biological agents on a
                        limited scale.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Chemical Weapons:</hi> The USSR will probably possess
                        the capability to engage in large-scale chemical warfare using World War <pb
                            xml:id="pg_335" n="335" facs="0365"/>II-type standard chemical agents.
                        By mid-1955, the USSR will probably possess limited stocks of nerve gas.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Capability to Deliver By Aircraft</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Strength of Long-Range Aviation:</hi> In mid-1953, the
                        USSR will probably possess about 1000 medium bombers of the TU–4 type
                        (comparable to the US B–29). By mid-1955, this number may be increased to
                        about 1100. Also, by mid-1955, the USSR may have as many as 180 heavy
                        bombers with a range about twice that of the TU–4. While the TU–4 might be
                        considered an obsolescent aircraft as compared with modern bomber aircraft
                        now operational in the U.S. Air Force, it does have comparative range,
                        load-carrying capacity, and reliability. It also has considerable capability
                        for operations during darkness and under conditions of poor visibility.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Ability to Stage against the United States:</hi> By
                        utilizing range-extension techniques known to the USSR, the stripped-down
                        TU–4 bomber can reach any target in the United States on a one-way mission.
                        The heavy bomber which may be available in mid-1955 presumably would be able
                        to make a roundtrip attack against any U.S. target by the use of
                        range-extension techniques. Bases for launching large numbers of bombers on
                        one-way missions against the United States are available or could be
                        developed within the period of this estimate.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Operational Capabilities:</hi> Soviet long-range
                        aviation is handicapped by lack of combat experience and lack of experience
                        in long-distance flying and navigation. Its capabilities for navigation,
                        target identification, and bomb placement, especially under conditions of
                        poor visibility, will be inferior to those of the U.S. Strategic Air Force.
                        Because of these limitations and because of the normal difficulties which
                        would be encountered in carrying out a large-scale bombing operation against
                        the continental United States, we estimate that about 20 per cent of the
                        bombers initially launched would abort and return to base before completing
                        their missions. In such an operation, we estimate that 10 per cent of the
                        bombers which do not abort would be operational losses, i.e., they would
                        fail to complete their missions for reasons other than combat. In attacks
                        upon U.S. overseas installations, we believe these operational losses will
                        be about 5 per cent. We also estimate that about 10 per cent of the bomb
                        drops by such aircraft as reach the target area will be ineffective as a
                        result of gross error and duds.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Medium and Light Jet Bomber Strength and
                            Capabilities:</hi> The USSR will possess substantial numbers of light
                        jet bombers capable of attacking many U.S. installations in Europe and the
                        Far East. By mid-1955, the USSR may have about 120 medium jet bombers
                        capable of attacking most U.S. installations overseas.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_336" n="336" facs="0366"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Capabilities of Naval and Ground Forces</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Naval:</hi> During the period under review, V–l and V–2
                        type guided missiles could be developed for launching from Soviet vessels
                        and presumably could be fitted with atomic warheads. By submarine
                        operations, aerial torpedo attacks, and offensive mining, the USSR could
                        inflict serious initial damage to U.S. overseas communications. Other Soviet
                        naval offensive capabilities are not significant.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a one-page “Table of Attrition Factors.”]</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Ground:</hi> The USSR has formidable capabilities for
                        undertaking large-scale ground operations on the Eurasian continent.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Amphibious:</hi> Soviet capabilities for amphibious
                        attack against the continental United States and against U.S. installations
                        overseas will be negligible, except against Alaska. Against Alaska, the USSR
                        might be able to launch an amphibious assault with up to 6000–8000
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Airborne:</hi> Soviet capabilities for airborne attack
                        against the continental United States (except Alaska) will be extremely
                        limited. The USSR could, if it chose, drop a small number of
                        specially-trained assault and sabotage forces for attack upon important, but
                        difficult, bombing targets. Against Alaska or against selected U.S.
                        installations overseas the USSR might be able to launch an attack with up to
                        a total of 4000 to 6000 troops.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Air Defense Capabilities</p>
                    <p>13. The Soviet rulers have demonstrated their sensitivity to the danger of
                        U.S. air attack with weapons of mass destruction by the high priority which
                        they have given to the development of defenses against such attack. Despite
                        progress in building up those defenses, it is unlikely that they would
                        regard their defensive capability as adequate to prevent substantial numbers
                        of attacking aircraft from reaching strategic targets in the USSR.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Sabotage Capabilities</p>
                    <p>14. The USSR’s capability for sabotage and subversion rests upon (a) the
                        capabilities and freedom of action of the U.S. Communist Party and of other
                        resident Soviet sympathizers, and (b) the USSR’s capability to introduce
                        agents and materials and to procure necessary materials within the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>15. The U.S. Communist Party consists of about 25, 000 persons. The majority
                        reside in the metropolitan industrial areas of the Atlantic and Pacific
                        coasts and in the Great Lakes–Middle West industrial region. The number best
                        equipped by training or employment to commit sabotage is about 6, 500. Key
                        industrial facilities employ about 1, 500 of this number. Except for atomic
                        weapons and <pb xml:id="pg_337" n="337" facs="0367"/>certain other weapons
                        of mass destruction, resident Communists or other saboteurs within the
                        United States could procure locally whatever weapons of sabotage they might
                        require. The gross capabilities of U.S. Communists may be limited to some
                        extent by (a) penetration of Communist organizations by U.S. security
                        agencies, (b) the fact that many would be placed under detention as soon as
                        possible after the outbreak of hostilities, and (c) casualties among those
                        potential saboteurs residing in metropolitan areas subjected to the Soviet
                        air atomic attack.</p>
                    <p>16. Saboteurs and weapons, including atomic weapons and their components
                        could be introduced from the outside by a variety of means. This capability
                        is limited only by the degree of risk of detection which the USSR is willing
                        to assume prior to an overt attack and by such intensified security measures
                        as the United States would impose after an attack.</p>
                    <p>17. Through control of certain U.S. labor organizations, the Communists have
                        the capability to impede war production by strikes and slowdowns. They also
                        could, by propaganda and provocation, increase the magnitude of civil
                        dislocation and panic during and immediately following a Soviet air atomic
                        attack.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">F. Limiting Effect of Need to Preserve Security</p>
                    <p>18. Surprise is the strongest weapon in the Soviet arsenal. Because of this,
                        the USSR would not be able to engage in preparations to carry out certain
                        naval, ground, amphibious, airborne, clandestine, and even air operations
                        which might disclose a positive intent to deliver an attack upon the United
                        States. A single instance of detection might alert the entire defense system
                        of the Western World and the U.S. air atomic counteroffensive forces.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. U.S. Capabilities</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Air Defense</p>
                    <p>19. As of mid-1953 the continental air defense system, consisting of a
                        warning and detection radar screen, supplemented by a partially manned
                        ground observer corps, fighter interceptor squadrons, and local AAA
                        defenses, will have the capability:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To provide a minimum warning of approximately 30 minutes for those
                            perimeter targets provided with radar cover, and</item>
                        <item>b. To “kill,” before bomb-release line, about 7 percent of the
                            attacking bomber force penetrating the defenses under most probable
                            conditions of attack.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>20. As of mid-1953, the principal deficiencies of the system will be:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Lack of radar coverage on the South Atlantic and southern
                            approaches,</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_338" n="338" facs="0368"/>
                        <item>b. Gaps in the existing radar screen,</item>
                        <item>c. Almost negligible capability of the radar system to detect low
                            flying aircraft (under 5, 000 feet),</item>
                        <item>d. Inadequate fighter forces with an all-weather capability,</item>
                        <item>e. Inadequate AAA defenses with a very high and very low altitude kill
                            potential,</item>
                        <item>f. Lack of a quick and positive identification system, especially for
                            the peace-time control of civil aircraft.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>21. As of mid-1953, the overseas defenses will in general be less effective
                        than those of the continental United States with respect to warning and
                        defensive fighter and AAA forces and weapons.</p>
                    <p>22. As of mid-1955, the continental air defenses will have materially
                        increased in effectiveness. The U.S. radar warning net will have been
                        augmented, and coverage extended into southern Canada and the North East
                        Command area. Airborne early warning aircraft and possibly a few picket
                        vessels will provide limited coverage over the seaward and northern
                        approaches. A proposed early warning zone in Canada generally along the 54th
                        parallel may possibly be in operation; however, considering the present
                        status of this project and of the proposed <persName
                            corresp="#p_LINCOLNCGA1">Lincoln</persName> line, neither was considered
                        in this evaluation. The fighter-interceptor force will be entirely equipped
                        with all-weather aircraft with improved armament. The AAA defenses will be
                        greatly improved with the deployment of Nike surface-to-air missile
                        battalions. The system will have the capability:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To provide additional coverage, with greater assurance of a minimum
                            of 30 minutes warning, and</item>
                        <item>b. To “kill,” before bomb-release line, about 27 percent of the

                    </list>
                    <p>23. The principal deficiencies of the system in mid-1955 will be:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. A low capability of the radar system to detect low flying

                    <p>24. The overseas defenses in mid-1955 will continue to be less effective than
                        those of the continental United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Air Offense</p>
                    <p>25. During the entire period under review, the U.S. Strategic Air Command
                        supplemented, within their ranges, by atomic aircraft of the naval carrier
                        forces and the overseas tactical air forces will be <pb xml:id="pg_339"

                        possesses the military initiative, and in view of the time required for the

                        surprise attack against the continental United States and U.S. forces and
                        installations overseas.</p>

                    <p>26. Considering Soviet capabilities for airborne and amphibious operations,
                        local U.S. forces, augmented as necessary by available reserves, can
                        isolate, neutralize, and eventually defeat any assaults of this nature on
                        the continental United States, Alaska, or vital overseas bases.</p>
                    <p>27. Considering Soviet capabilities for submarine operations and offensive
                        mining, initial damage to shipping might be severe. With full implementation
                        of anti-submarine warfare, however, U.S. counter-measures could reduce this
                        initial damage to acceptable proportions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Defense Against Sabotage</p>
                    <p>28. The military forces, industrial security and protective forces, and those
                        federal, state and local agencies responsible for the security and
                        protection of installations and facilities necessary to the national defense
                        and the conduct of war, have been alerted to the possibility of sabotage.
                        The degree of protection against conventional types of sabotage either
                        existing or possible is not uniform for all such installations or
                        facilities, nor can it be. Some facilities are vulnerable to conventional
                        sabotage by reason of easy access by potential saboteurs, others by reason
                        of employment within the facility of persons known to be dangerous potential
                        saboteurs.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>30. In the event of war there have been readied for immediate implementation
                        appropriate programs for apprehension and detention of persons who
                        constitute a threat to the nation’s internal security. If these programs are
                        properly implemented, most of the individuals determined to be potentially
                        or actually dangerous will be neutralized within a short period after Soviet
                        attack. It can be expected, however, that some persons in these categories,
                        including unknown sabotage agents introduced into the United States, may be
                        successful in avoiding immediate arrest, with possible subversive acts
                        resulting.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Civil Defense</p>
                    <p>31. The federal civil defense program, as of mid-1953, is well organized,
                        planned, and partially implemented, but it is not fully manned on a
                        round-the-clock basis. State and local programs throughout the country vary
                        widely in the degree of organization, planning and implementation. Some of
                        the accomplishments to date in many localities include organization and
                        fixing of responsibility, the establishment of primary and alternate control
                        centers with associated communications, education and training, and
                        designation and marking of shelters, the stockpiling and “spotting” of
                        medical supplies and other equipment, and the coordination of medical and
                        fire-fighting personnel. Local accomplishments vary widely from a high state
                        of readiness in certain critical areas to none at all in some other
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>32. The over-all program, as of mid-1953, is capable of materially reducing
                        deaths and casualties which might result from an atomic attack, the degree
                        of reduction depending on the amount of warning received, and of providing
                        protection to an undeterminable degree against mass hysteria and
                        psychological shock. It has been estimated that in an atomic attack on
                        metropolitan centers, an average of one hour’s warning would reduce
                        casualties by about 50 percent. Adequate early warning is the most important
                        requirement to bring the civil defense program into full effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>33. Continuation of present over-all programs, with increased emphasis on
                        education of the public in civil defense matters, will result in increased
                        effectiveness by mid-1955.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. Vulnerability of the United States to Atomic Attack</p>
                    <p>34. The target systems of the United States which the USSR would consider for
                        attack are: (a) U.S. air offensive forces and supporting bases, (b) other
                        U.S. forces and supporting installations, (c) the critical war-supporting
                        industries of the United States and (d) the general economic strengths,
                        population, and governmental control centers in the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Vulnerability of U.S. Air Offensive Forces and
                        Bases</p>
                    <p>35. In order to achieve critical damage on U.S. air offensive forces, attack
                        must be accomplished under conditions of almost complete surprise, since a
                        definite threat or notice of attack would permit the Strategic Air Command
                        to disperse its forces. With a warning period of one hour or less, no
                        significant dispersal could be accomplished. However, a two-hour warning
                        period would permit <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to disperse 65
                        percent of its atomic carriers; a six-hour warning would permit an 85
                        percent dispersal. Successful attack upon bases after dispersal would serve
                        to neutralize those bases for initial <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341"
                            facs="0371"/>operations only. The nuclear stockpile, under present
                        conditions of storage, is virtually invulnerable to atomic destruction from
                        the air.</p>
                    <p>36. The U.S. Strategic Air Command possesses a substantial amount of
                        flexibility and mobility. There are a large number of airfields in the
                        United States and abroad which are equipped, or could be equipped readily,
                        to handle atomic carriers. <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> would retain
                        the capability to carry out intercontinental operations even if its
                        operating and staging bases outside the United States were rendered
                        inoperable. Moreover, even if an initial attack upon <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> overseas forces and bases achieved a considerable degree of
                        success, continued neutralization would require a Soviet capability to
                        re-attack those bases which might be re-occupied.</p>
                    <p>37. Although the radar detection system can provide only a half-hour warning,
                        many <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> interior installations in the
                        United States would receive up to four hours warning. Because of the
                        probability of such extended warning, and considering the flexibility,
                        mobility, recuperability and over-all aircraft strength of <gloss
                            target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, we believe that a Soviet attack could not
                        reduce <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s capability to a level that
                        would inhibit heavy retaliatory attacks on the USSR. This capability could
                        be reduced and delayed, however, by a limited attack upon bomber bases in
                        the United States and upon selected overseas bases.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Vulnerability of Other U.S. Forces and Supporting
                        Installations</p>
                    <p>38. Military installations within the U.S. which are not a part of the air
                        offensive system constitute some of the least profitable targets in the
                        United States for atomic attack. Although the air defense system is an
                        unprofitable objective for air atomic attack, if the USSR anticipates
                        unacceptable losses of atomic weapons as a consequence of the operations of
                        the active defenses, a requirement for neutralization of certain elements of
                        the air defense system by conventional weapons would be established. Radar
                        control stations, which are undefended against low altitude attack, are
                        vital elements of the system and are vulnerable to neutralization by such
                        operations. There are no strictly military installations outside of
                        metropolitan complexes which represent concentrations of personnel and
                        material of such magnitude and importance as to represent profitable targets
                        for atomic attack.</p>
                    <p>39. Among U.S. forces and installations outside the continental United States
                        not a part of the U.S. air offensive capability, there are some targets
                        worthy of atomic attack. Because these forces and installations would not be
                        brought into action as part of an early U.S. air counteroffensive, we have
                        not evaluated them as targets for atomic attack.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_342" n="342" facs="0372"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Vulnerability of Critical War-Supporting
                        Industries</p>
                    <p>40. The U.S. has such a great economic potential that the USSR could not
                        destroy it with the number of atomic weapons presently estimated as
                        available to the USSR during the period of this evaluation. The USSR might,
                        however, direct its attack against the most important or most critical
                        sectors of the economy. Nevertheless, because of the substantial U.S.
                        retaliatory capability in being, the impact of such attack on our overall
                        offensive capability would be delayed. Attacks upon fabricating facilities
                        for atomic weapons, air frames, aircraft engines, guided missiles,
                        large-caliber guns and munitions, would be effective only after existing
                        stocks were exhausted. Attacks upon basic materials production would be
                        effective only over a much longer period, and their impact would be reduced
                        as a result of current and planned stockpiling, substitution, recuperation,
                        and expansion of remaining facilities.</p>
                    <p>41. Successful attacks upon critical industries require a high degree of
                        operational proficiency by the attacking forces. The attacker must possess
                        adequate data regarding the degree of criticality of individual industries
                        and facilities, adequate targeting data to insure determination of optimum
                        aiming points at each facility, and sufficient proficiency to locate the
                        targets and to place the weapons within a minimum circle of error.</p>
                    <p>42. Even though general industry is concentrated around the two coasts and in
                        the Great Lakes area, most critical war-supporting industry is well
                        dispersed. The steel industry, for example, has some 143 plants, of which
                        the 35 largest are located at various points from Chicago eastward to the
                        coast. Petroleum refining capacity is distributed among 350 installations,
                        the 100 largest of which hold 75 percent of the capacity and are scattered
                        from Texas to Chicago and along the coasts. One of the most vulnerable is
                        the tetraethyl lead industry consisting of three plants, one of which
                        accounts for 50 percent of the total production.</p>
                    <p>43. Assuming adequate data and sufficient proficiency to insure successful
                        placement, and taking account of estimated losses on route to target, the
                        following are the estimated numbers of weapons which the USSR would be
                        obliged to dispatch against only a small number of critical industries in
                        order to achieve the levels of damage indicated:</p>

                        more. These 54 complexes contain 71 percent of the country’s war industry
                        and 35 percent of the country’s population. They also contain the nerve
                        centers of economic and governmental control.</p>
                    <p>46. In mid-1953, if the USSR launched virtually its entire atomic weapons
                        stockpile against those urban areas in the United States with the greatest
                        population densities, and if it succeeded in attacking without warning and
                        in achieving optimum placement, it has been estimated that casualties as
                        high as 24, 000, 000 might be inflicted. In mid-1955, the same kind of
                        attack under the same conditions with the larger stockpile might produce
                        personnel casualties as high as 31, 000, 000. It is estimated that
                        casualties would be reduced by approximately one-half with one hour warning.
                        About one-half of the casualties would result in deaths. In such attacks,
                        designed primarily to produce casualties, there would also be serious
                        industrial damage, widespread dislocation of our highly integrated economic
                        and social systems, loss of morale, panic, defeatism, etc., in amounts and
                        to degrees which it is impossible to measure on the basis of any presently
                        available valid data.</p>
                    <p>47. These population, industrial, and control centers are largely in the
                        northeastern part of the United States, in the northern <pb xml:id="pg_344"
                            n="344" facs="0374"/>Middle West, and in the coastal areas. They are,
                        therefore, on the periphery of the defended area and are of such size in
                        themselves as to offer targets which could most easily and successfully, of
                        all areas in the United States, be brought under attack by the inexperienced
                        Soviet long-range bomber force.</p>
                    <p>48. While the net effect of a successful attack cannot be estimated with
                        acceptable accuracy, at a minimum, it would disrupt the governmental control
                        system, it would strain the civil defense system far beyond its present
                        capabilities, and it would necessitate a prolonged rehabilitation effort.
                        The U.S. retaliatory force itself, however, would be relatively intact and
                        would be able to carry out its prescribed mission. There would be no
                        physical reason why it could not deliver heavy and devastating retaliatory
                        blows against the USSR.</p>

                        waging war effectively by attacking any one of the following with atomic

                        the course of action within its capabilities which we believe would most

                    <p>53. In order to take advantage of the known deficiencies in the U.S. defense
                        system, the most feasible and effective air attack upon the continental
                        United States could be made at night with the attacking aircraft penetrating
                        the U.S. radar detection network at low altitudes. Attacks upon U.S. forward
                        and staging bases outside the United States would need to be timed to follow
                        attacks upon the continental United States in order to preserve surprise.
                        Attacks upon the continental United States would necessarily be one-way
                        missions with aerial refueling en route in secure areas. Most flights would
                        be launched from the Chukotski and Kola peninsulas and would employ routes
                        designed to give maximum security from early detection by ground observers
                        or ships and planes following normal travel lanes. An operational and attack
                        plan believed to have reasonable chance of success would contain the
                        following elements:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The 62 atomic weapons allocated to major U.S. population,
                            industrial and control complexes would be launched in 62 TU–4 aircraft
                            against 31 such complexes with take-off times coordinated in an attempt
                            to obtain simultaneous penetration of the outer radar detection
                            network,</item>
                        <item>b. Twelve of the atomic weapons allocated to the U.S. air atomic
                            offensive capability would be launched in 12 TU–4 aircraft against heavy
                            bomber bases in the United States. Take-off times would be established
                            in an attempt to bring these aircraft to bomb-release line insofar as
                            possible simultaneously with the penetration of the radar detection
                            network by the 62 aircraft targeted against the U.S. metropolitan
                            complexes. These 12 aircraft would attempt a clandestine attack,
                            employing U.S. markings, taking advantage of weaknesses in the U.S.
                            detection and identification system, using U.S. navigational aids and
                            flying the airways to the target areas,</item>
                        <item>c. Twenty-four of the atomic weapons allocated to the U.S. air
                            offensive capability would be launched against forward and staging air
                            bases and air forces, in Soviet aircraft and in flight cells most
                            appropriate to the individual targets to be attacked. Their take-off
                            times would be established so that they would reach target areas as soon
                            as possible after the penetration of U.S. radar detection network by the
                            main attack,</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_346" n="346" facs="0376"/>
                        <item>d. The ten weapons remaining in the allocation to the U.S. air
                            offensive capabilities would be launched against forward and staging air
                            bases and air forces at a later date, as reconnaissance demonstrated
                            that these bases were re-occupied with profitable numbers of
                            aircraft,</item>
                        <item>e. All planes carrying atomic weapons which aborted and returned to
                            base would be re-launched against their original allocation at a later
                            date,</item>
                        <item>f. The atomic air attack on overseas bases would be supplemented,
                            wherever feasible, by continuing attacks with conventional bombs.</item>

                    <p>54. Because of the improved U.S. early warning system, the USSR would have
                        less chance of achieving surprise. Attack at night would still be the most
                        advantageous to the attacking force. The availability of a heavy bomber with
                        greater range than the TU–4 and the greater number of weapons available
                        would alter both the nature of the attack and its magnitude. The heavy
                        bombers would approach the U.S. at high altitude and maximum speed to avoid
                        interception, while the TU–4’s would approach at low altitude to avoid
                        detection. Bases in the interior of the USSR would be required in order to
                        achieve a high initial sortie, but the greater distances to the United
                        States would be compensated by adjusting locations for refueling and
                        individual targets to the base areas utilized. An operational and attack
                        plan believed to have reasonable chance of success would contain the
                        following elements:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The 151 atomic weapons allocated to major U.S. population,
                            industrial and control complexes would be launched against 50 such
                            complexes in flights containing a total of 294 aircraft. As many as 100
                            of these might be heavy bombers. Those aircraft not carrying atomic
                            weapons would carry electronic counter-measures equipment and possibly
                            fire and high-explosive bombs and <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss>
                            weapons. Some would be given diversionary missions. All take-off times
                            would be coordinated in an attempt to provide approximately simultaneous
                            penetration of the outer radar detection network.</item>
                        <item>b. Fourteen atomic weapons would be launched against heavy bomber
                            bases in the United States following the same attack pattern as in 1953.
                            Seven additional weapons would be launched in the main attack against
                            peripheral medium bomber bases in the United States.</item>
                        <item>c. Thirty-three atomic weapons would be launched initially against
                            forward and staging air bases and air forces as soon as possible after
                            penetration of the radar detection network by the main attack.</item>
                        <item>d. The 35 weapons remaining in the allocation to the U.S. air
                            offensive capability would be launched at a later date as reconnaissance
                            demonstrated that there were bases operational which contained
                            profitable numbers of aircraft.</item>

                            date.</item>
                        <item>f. The atomic air attack on overseas bases would be supplemented,
                            wherever feasible, by continuing attacks, with conventional
                            bombs.</item>

                            Capability:</hi> The attacks upon the bomber bases in the United States
                        and upon the forward and staging bases outside the United States would
                        render those installations temporarily inoperable. Considerable numbers of
                        trained personnel would be killed. Runways and underground fuel storage
                        would suffer relatively little damage. Maintenance facilities, supplies,
                        exposed refueling gear, and communications facilities, would be destroyed or
                        severely damaged. Aircraft caught on base would be destroyed or badly
                        damaged. Of all the aircraft, including naval and tactical, possessing an
                        atomic delivery capability, in 1953 about 24 per cent, and in 1955 about 30
                        per cent, would be destroyed or severely damaged. Nevertheless, the number
                        of remaining U.S. aircraft having an atomic capability would be much higher
                        in 1955 than in 1953. Such attacks would force the Strategic <pb

                        intercontinental operations and reduce the optimum monthly sortie rate by
                        about 50 per cent. This situation would continue as long as the USSR could
                        maintain neutralization of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases
                        overseas.</p>
                    <p>59. <hi rend="italic">Personnel Casualties:</hi> If U.S. metropolitan centers
                        were attacked solely with the object of maximizing personnel losses,
                        casualties as high a figure as 9, 000, 000 might result in mid-1953 and as
                        high as 12, 500, 000 in mid-1955, computed on the basis of a minimum of a
                        half-hour, and an average of one hour, warning. One-half of these casualties
                        might result in death. The attacking force, however, would not necessarily
                        select precise aiming points designed purely to maximize personnel
                        casualties, nor would it obtain optimum weapon placement. We believe,
                        therefore, that actual casualties would be at an indeterminate lower level,
                        possibly as low as 50 per cent of the figures given. Moreover, the number of
                        casualties would vary widely with locality according to the amount of
                        warning received, the effectiveness of the civil defense organization, and
                        other unpredictable factors.</p>
                    <p>60. <hi rend="italic">Effect Upon Industry:</hi> There would be initial
                        paralysis of all industry within the areas attacked. In mid-1953, about
                        one-third of total U.S. industry, including war-supporting industry, is
                        located within or near such areas. In mid-1955, because of the wider scope
                        of the attack, this proportion is increased to about two-thirds. Since much
                        of this industry is physically widespread within these areas, the amount of
                        direct damage cannot be accurately estimated. However, the direct and
                        indirect results of the attack would be such as to seriously affect the
                        national economy. It is considered unlikely that area bombing as employed
                        would destroy a critical portion of any important industry, or that it would
                        seriously cripple any critical category of war industry. Scattered damage to
                        plants engaged in the manufacture of components and parts might be more
                        serious than the damage to major end-product manufacturing facilities, and
                        might seriously affect the production of critical war equipment. Considering
                        the entire U.S. industrial plant, including facilities located in areas free
                        from attack, we believe that, with forceful and well-planned measures for
                        rehabilitation, the over-all physical damage would not be of such
                        proportions as to prevent U.S. industry from adequately supporting
                        large-scale and extensive military operations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Military Attack Other Than Air</p>
                    <p>61. If the USSR should launch a military attack against the continental U.S.
                        with other than air forces, the damage resulting would not significantly add
                        to the damage estimates noted above. Such attacks upon U.S. installations
                        and forces outside the U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_349" n="349" facs="0379"/>which
                        are a part of the U.S. air atomic counteroffensive capability likewise would
                        not significantly add to the damage which would result from air attack.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Psychological Effect</p>
                    <p>65. The potentially most serious consequence of the Soviet attack would be
                        the psychological impact of a large-scale atomic attack. There would be
                        morale and political problems of a magnitude which it is impossible to
                        estimate, or even comprehend, on the basis of any presently available valid
                        data. The capability of the United States to bring the considerable
                        remaining manpower and economic potential into the prosecution of the war
                        would depend upon the adequacy of advance planning and upon the resolution
                        and resourcefulness with which government and leadership dealt with the
                        problems of waging the war, including neutralization of the USSR atomic
                        capability, and of providing for the physical and psychological needs of our
                        people as a whole.</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p>1. The three separate Task Forces will be organized to work at The National
                        War College. The Commandant of The National War College will provide the
                        necessary administrative facilities and support. A small technical staff
                        composed of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_BONESTEELBGCH1">C. H.
                            Bonesteel</persName> as Executive, Colonel V. J. Esposito as Logistical
                        Advisor and Colonel R. Hackett as Costing Advisor will assist the Commandant
                        and the Task Forces. Mr. T. M. Koons, of the National Security Council
                        Staff, aided by Chief Warrant Officer Leland W. Thompson, USA, will act as
                        Executive Secretary. It may be found desirable to co-opt as a temporary
                        member of the staff a senior officer of the Bureau of the Budget to provide
                        budgetary advice to the Task Forces from time to time. Any of the faculty or
                        students of The National War College will be available to assist if
                        required.</p>
                    <p>2. Arrangements must be made to provide experts from the Executive
                        Departments and Agencies for consultation with the Task Forces as required.
                        These witnesses need not be informed of the project under way. They can be
                        told they are being called upon in connection with a War College
                        project.</p>
                    <p>3. Physical accommodations and most of the necessary equipment and supplies
                        will be furnished by The National War College. Six expert, security cleared
                        shorthand-typists will be required from other sources.</p>
                    <p>4. Visual aids for presentation purposes should be made up somewhere other
                        than at the War College so as not to compromise the Cover Plan applying to
                        the work of the Task Forces.</p>
                    <p>5. Authority will be needed to order required personnel to temporary duty at
                        the War College and to obtain needed services. The source of funds required
                        for travel expenses, per diem, etc., needs to be fixed.</p>

                    <p>1. During the week ending 23 May, the Task Forces will be formed, initial
                        briefing performed, intelligence and background data accumulated. A

                    <p>(These might need to be scheduled later if many members of the Task Forces
                        are required to travel some distance to get to Washington)</p>
                    <p>2. The week 24–30 May will be devoted to general exploration of each
                        Alternative in the form it is expressed in the original Memo for the Record,
                        dated 9 May. Task Forces will be available for consultation with the
                        Directing Panel while the Panel is finalizing the terms of reference.</p>
                    <p>3. The two weeks 31 May–13 June will be devoted to the formulation of initial
                        plans and presentations for each Alternative. These initial presentations
                        will be made before the Directing Officers and the Panel on the week-end
                        13–14 June. The Panel will then make such criticisms and suggestions to the
                        Task Forces as are required to assure that the finished presentations will
                        be of the type and substance desired.</p>
                    <p>4. The ten days 15–24 June will be used to complete the plans and
                        presentations in accordance with the critique of 13–14 June. Semi-final
                        presentations will be given to the Panel on 24–25 June.</p>
                    <p>5. The Task Forces will be prepared to give their finished presentations to
                        the President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> any time after 28
                        June.</p>
                    <p>6. During the working periods there will be frequent plenary sessions at
                        which all Task Forces can exchange ideas and be informed of the others
                        work.</p>
                    <p>7. The Commandant of The National War College and the Technical Staff for the
                        project will assist the Task Forces as required.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Part IV—Security Arrangements</p>
                    <p>1. The highest security will be maintained concerning the existence and
                        object of the project.</p>
                    <p>2. As a Cover Plan it is suggested that the group working at the War College
                        be explained by calling them a Board of Review on <pb xml:id="pg_354"
                            n="354" facs="0384"/>National Security Education, with the purported
                        task of examining the present system.</p>
                    <p>3. Special identity passes will be issued to all persons working on the
                        project and the area in which they work will be under special security
                        guard.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Part V—Actions Required</p>
                    <p>1. Early approval as to the composition of the Task Forces.</p>
                    <p>2. Authority for the Commandant of The National War College to request orders
                        be issued to bring government employed personnel of the Task Forces to
                        temporary but full time duty at the War College. One means of handling this
                        is to have the President sign a memorandum to certain Chiefs of Executive
                        Departments and Agencies requesting them to provide personnel and services
                        as requested. A draft of such a letter is attached.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d66fn6">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Provision of competent shorthand-typists. This would be effected by the
                        Commandant of The National War College through use of the Presidential
                        memorandum suggested in 2 above.</p>
                    <p>4. Arrangements for briefings of the Task Forces. Depending on when the Task
                        Forces can be assembled, these can be arranged by the Commandant of the
                        National War College under the authority of the Presidential memorandum.</p>
                    <p>5. Arrangements for obtaining intelligence and background material and, from
                        time to time the services of expert advisors from Executive Departments.
                        This can be handled as in 4 above.</p>
                    <p>6. Security clearance, administrative arrangements, compensation, etc., of
                        persons not presently employed by the government who are asked to serve on
                        the Task Forces. Recommend these be effected by the State Department.<note

                        Injury on the United States up to July 1, 1955</p>
                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 140/1, subject as above. They note that the purpose of the
                        report is to evaluate the net capability of the USSR to inflict direct
                        injury on the United States in the period up to July 1, 1955. They further
                        note that the <pb xml:id="pg_356" n="356" facs="0386"/>terms of reference
                        also included USSR capability to attack major U.S. installations outside of
                        the United States, such installations selected on the basis of their
                        relative importance to the defense of the United States or to a United
                        States counteroffensive against the USSR.</p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to invite attention to the fact that the
                        terms of reference on which the report is based limit consideration to only
                        one aspect of the over-all problem of effects of the possible courses of
                        action with which the USSR may initiate war and these terms of reference
                        should not be construed as representing the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff as to the manner in which the USSR would wage war. Although the report
                        is a valuable contribution to defense planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        consider that it provides only a segment of the data necessary, and
                        therefore does not constitute a sufficiently broad basis for planning for
                        the over-all security of the United States.</p>

                            >NSC</gloss> 140/1</p>
                    <p>1. The subject paper has been reviewed by this Agency and found to be in
                        consonance with the intelligence now available to us except for one minor
                        point mentioned below in paragraph 2–a. In my opinion, the Subcommittee is
                        to be highly commended for the quality of its report and the unique
                        contribution it makes to our understanding of the nation’s defense problem.
                        It amply justifies efforts that have gone into it and to my mind suggests
                        the advisability of similar attacks on other difficult questions requiring
                        the blending of operational and intelligence information into “net”
                        estimates.</p>
                    <p>2. I have only two comments as to the substance of the reports:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item> a. On page 8, in paragraph 5 of the Discussion, it is stated
                            that:</item>
                        <item>“. . . In mid-1953, the USSR will probably possess about 1, 000 medium
                            bombers of the TU–4 type (comparable to U.S. B–29). By mid-1955, this
                            number may be increased to about 1, 100. . . .” <pb xml:id="pg_357"
                                n="357" facs="0387"/>Since this portion of the paper was prepared,
                            further evidence has come to light which has caused us now to estimate
                            that the Soviet Union has over 1, 600 of these planes at the present
                            time and is producing them at the rate of about 35 per month. Since the
                            number of TU–4’s assumed to take part in attack is well below 1, 000 in
                            the period mid-1953 to mid-1955, the conclusions of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1 are in no way affected by this
                            revision; but it might be pointed out that any doubts as to whether the
                            Soviet medium bomber fleet is sufficient to enable the Soviet Long-Range
                            Air Force to expend planes relatively plentifully in one-way missions,
                            are pretty well dissipated.</item>
                        <item>b. In order to keep the problem within manageable limits, General
                            Edwards’ Subcommittee based its calculations on the “best estimate”
                            figure as to Soviet atomic bomb stockpile. As pointed out in <gloss
                                target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>–36, NSIE–1, <note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4"
                                >Special Estimate 36, “Soviet Capabilities for Attack on the United
                                States through mid-1955” is in INR files, lot 58 D 528, “Special
                                Estimates”; NSIE–l cannot be further identified.</note> and
                            elsewhere, this median figure is never given except in conjunction with
                            upper and lower limits—plus 100 percent or minus 33⅓ percent
                            respectively. Thus it should be borne in mind that by 30 June 1955, the
                            Soviets <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have a stockpile up to twice as
                            large as that taken as a basis for the calculations in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1. Again this does not affect, in
                            my judgment, the validity of the general conclusions of the report. It
                            merely means that the magnitude of the Soviet capability envisaged
                            therein for mid-1955 might be increased or reduced, or advanced or
                            delayed by a year or more.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. This Agency strongly recommends <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1
                        to the Council as a sound intelligence estimate and as an appropriate basis
                        for developing national policy.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName>: Reference is made to
                        your memorandum of May 19, 1953,<note n="6" xml:id="d67fn6">Not
                            printed.</note> which transmitted for review and comment by the
                        Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference a report prepared by the Special
                        Evaluation Subcommittee of the National Security Council pursuant to a
                        directive contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_358" n="358" facs="0388"/>
                    <p>The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference has certain comments to offer.
                        The Soviet plan of attack as set forth in the report admittedly is not the
                        only plan which the Soviets might logically pursue. The air attack
                        contemplates delivery of the bulk of Soviet atomic weapons against certain
                        of the major population centers of the United States. The Soviet leaders
                        would have to weigh the advantages of such an attack which would involve
                        only the random destruction of critical war industry against the fact that
                        the bulk of the known Communist Party members in the United States and
                        approximately two thirds of the most dangerous potential Communist saboteurs
                        reside in the areas indicated for attack under the plan proposed. The Soviet
                        leaders have in the past, in other countries and under war conditions
                        utilized the indigenous Communists for underground guerrilla and sabotage
                        operations. Any difference in allocation of atomic weapons under the plan of
                        attack might have resulted in more atomic weapons being available for
                        clandestine use.</p>
                    <p>The damage effects from clandestine attack and sabotage are set out on page
                        27 of the report. The language used in paragraph 63 thereof might leave an
                        inaccurate impression, since the effects of “portable atomic weapons” are
                        compared with those of air-dropped bombs. We understand it is a fact that
                        clandestinely-placed atomic demolition weapons can have a much greater
                        destructive power than the typical Soviet air-dropped atomic weapons
                        contemplated in the evaluation. Damage resulting from use of clandestine
                        atomic weapons could have been evaluated qualitatively had the Subcommittee
                        designated specific targets for demolition atomic weapons in its plan of
                        attack on the basis of the statements regarding vulnerability of certain
                        critical facilities which appeared in paragraph 49 on page 20 of the
                        report.</p>
                    <p>The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference, applying the above
                        observations, approves the report.</p>

                    <p>While it is realized that other plans of attack are available to the Soviets
                        and might have been considered, the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> is
                        confining its observations to the Soviet concept of operation and plan of
                        attack adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Evaluation
                        Subcommittee. In this connection, the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>
                        believes the report undervalues the likelihood of sabotage with atomic
                        demolition weapons. This could be misleading.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> disagrees with the conclusion
                        stated in the third sentence of paragraph 4–d (1), page 6, for the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>Fissionable material diverted to small weapons for clandestine attack
                        purposes would make available more weapons than the same amount of
                        fissionable material would in weapons for military attack by air. If so
                        diverted, these small weapons would permit a broader selection of targets
                        and increase the likelihood of complete destruction of a greater number of
                        critically important facilities. The <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>
                        concludes, accordingly, that the effect of clandestine atomic weapons
                        properly placed could be considerably greater rather than “broadly
                        equivalent” to the effect of the same amount of fissionable material used in
                        air dropped weapons. Furthermore, as paragraph 4–d (1) indicates,
                        clandestinely employed atomic weapons are one hundred percent effective
                        whereas elsewhere in the report it is clearly indicated that weapons
                        assigned to air drop are subject to a substantial percentage of aborts,
                        operational losses, etc., as set forth in paragraph 7, page 9.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> wishes to emphasize that the
                        foregoing must be considered in direct relation to the possibility of
                        detection of alien fissionable material. We cannot be assured of receiving
                        advance information in this regard. There are no practical technical means
                        available either now or in the foreseeable future for the detection of alien
                        fissionable material. Such material, without any reasonable likelihood of
                        detection, can be introduced clandestinely into the United States through
                        varied means which include but are not limited to the diplomatic pouch, the
                        person, personal effects or baggage of legal or illegal entrants, shipments
                        by land, sea and air, either at established ports of entry or across our
                        unprotected coast lines and land borders. Once so introduced there is only a
                        slight <pb xml:id="pg_360" n="360" facs="0390"/>possibility of detecting
                        such alien fissionable material either in disassembled or assembled form
                        wherever located.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I. Purpose</p>
                    <p>1. The President has approved the creation of a project under the direction
                        of the National Security Council to formulate and present alternative
                        courses of action which the United States might presently or in the future
                        undertake with respect to the Soviet power bloc.</p>
                    <p>2. In fulfillment of its portion of the project, the Panel has selected and
                        defined in general terms certain courses of action for study, development
                        and evaluation by Task Forces under terms and conditions set forth
                        below.</p>
                    <p>3. Each Task Force will prepare and later present its report to the National
                        Security Council in order to assist the Council in making its recommendation
                        of the best courses of action to be adopted by the United States.</p>

                    <p>a. The capabilities of the Soviet bloc will be assumed to be as set forth in

                        such other agreed intelligence and pertinent studies as exist within the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>b. In order to avoid differing estimates by the several Task Forces as to
                        Soviet intentions, each Task Force will analyze the course of action
                        assigned to it with reference to the following alternative Soviet lines of
                        action:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The Soviets may seek a military decision with the West at any
                            time, based either upon a determination to resort to war as an
                            instrument of policy or upon a miscalculation as to free world
                            intentions and capabilities.</item>
                        <item>(2) The Soviets may maintain, at some risk of general war, aggressive
                            pressure, continuously or interspersed with active phases of “Peace
                            Offensives”, to extend their control and weaken the free world
                            coalition.</item>
                        <item>(3) The Soviets may accept a defensive posture in order to consolidate
                            the present position of the Soviet bloc and to avoid a risk of general
                            war, relying upon and encouraging the divisive forces within the free
                            world.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Panel has not entirely excluded the possibility that the Soviets will,
                        for reasons of their own, become bona fide peaceful members of the family of
                        nations, but does not consider such action sufficiently likely to include it
                        in the foregoing Soviet lines of action. The Task Forces, however, may find
                        it desirable at least to consider this possibility in examining and
                        developing the policy assigned to them.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Factors Used in Selecting U.S. Courses of Action
                        for Study.</p>
                    <p>a. The Panel has recognized that courses of action, other than those
                        recommended below for Task Force examination, are conceptually possible and,
                        indeed, may receive support from one or another quarter. The Panel calls
                        attention, therefore, to certain courses which it has excluded from its
                        directives as being in conflict <pb xml:id="pg_362" n="362" facs="0392"
                        />with the realities of the world situation. Examples of those excluded
                        are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) A course of action which would rest upon a drastic reduction of
                            our armed strength (in the absence of effective international
                            regulation) and a determination not to fight except in the event of
                            invasion of U.S. territory.</item>
                        <item>(2) A course of action which would, as a deliberate choice, rely
                            solely upon the economic and military strength of the United
                            States.</item>
                        <item>(3) A course of action which would involve a major change in the
                            structure of international organization (Atlantic Union, World
                            Government, etc.).</item>
                        <item>(4) A course of action which would contemplate the launching of a
                            preventive war against the Soviet Union on our own initiative.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>b. The Panel has also recognized that the separate courses of action to be
                        studied by Task Forces may be divided and combined in many variations. It
                        seemed to the Panel that its own task could best be performed if it set
                        clearly distinguishable courses before the Task Forces in such a way as to
                        develop a full examination of the factors involved. After the Task Forces
                        have completed their work on specific alternatives, and the National
                        Security Council has had an opportunity for preliminary consideration, it
                        will probably be necessary to attempt a synthesis of the constructive
                        elements of several alternatives, as a basis for final decision.</p>
                    <p>c. The Panel would add the comment that vitally important as it is to develop
                        a unity and consistency of effort behind basic courses of action and to
                        project them into the future, no major policy decision can serve the needs
                        of the United States unless subjected to continuous review and modified to
                        exploit changing circumstances.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. Specific Instructions</p>
                    <p>1. Each Task Force will prepare its study as a proposed coordinated policy
                        for the United States, to the extent possible in terms of specific actions
                        or projects. It is important that each Task Force take into account not only
                        the mechanical and material factors involved in its proposed policy but also
                        the psychological, philosophical and ideological intangibles which may
                        effect the cohesion and common purpose with which the nations of the free
                        world face the challenge and threat of Communism.</p>
                    <p>2. Each Task Force should consider such of the following questions as are
                        relevant to its proposed courses of action, using its own discretion as to
                        how such questions should be handled in its final report:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. What general results are expected to be accomplished by the
                            proposed policy? Over what general time period?</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_363" n="363" facs="0393"/>
                        <item>b. What specific actions (diplomatic, political, military, economic,
                            administrative, or other) should be undertaken by the United States to
                            implement the proposed policy? What is the time phasing of such
                            actions?</item>
                        <item>c. What major lines of action now being carried out by the United
                            States should be abandoned in order to act economically and to remain
                            consistent with the proposed policy?</item>
                        <item>d. What is the approximate magnitude and rate of expenditure of U.S.
                            resources which would be required to carry out the proposed actions?
                            What is the comparative probability and general magnitude of U.S.
                            casualties involved?</item>
                        <item>e. Which features of the proposed policy and actions can be made
                            public, and what elements should remain secret?</item>
                        <item>f. To what extent would the proposed policy and lines of action be
                            supported by U.S. public opinion and by the U.S. Congress, assuming
                            vigorous leadership on the part of the principal officers of government?
                            Would the proposed actions require additional major legislation?</item>
                        <item>g. What is the estimated effect of the proposed policy and actions
                            upon U.S. relations with (1) the Latin American governments, (2) the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments, (3) other Western
                            European governments, (4) the governments of Japan, the Philippines,
                            Australia and New Zealand, (5) countries of the Asian-Arab bloc and
                            others not now allied with the United States? What action can be taken
                            to increase the support of world opinion for the proposed policy and to
                            minimize adverse effects?</item>
                        <item>h. Are the proposed actions consistent with the United States
                            commitments under the United Nations Charter, other treaty obligations,
                            and the general rules of international law?</item>
                        <item>i. How would the leaders of the Soviet Union be expected to interpret
                            and react to actions by the United States under the proposed policy? Of
                            Red China?</item>
                        <item>j. To what degree would the proposed actions reasonably safeguard the
                            security of the United States and of its principal allies regardless of
                            the line of action adopted by the Soviet Union?</item>
                        <item>k. To what degree would the proposed actions affect the risk of
                            general war?</item>

                            Iron Curtain coalition? What effect would these actions have on the
                            people of those countries? What steps can be taken to enlist the support

                        <item>p. In what specific ways would it be possible to confront the Soviet
                            Union with necessary choices between alternatives other than general
                            war, any of which would work to the advantage of the United States and
                            its allies?</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. Any assumptions made by a Task Force should be clearly stated and promptly
                        coordinated with other Task Forces concerned.</p>
                    <p>4. Each Task Force will develop the presentation of the policy assigned to it
                        in the same manner that a responsible advocate works up a case for court.
                        Though the arguments in favor of the policy will be marshalled as
                        effectively as possible, each Task Force is also charged with disclosing the
                        weaknesses inherent in that policy and the countervailing arguments.
                        Consultation between Task Forces and mutual criticism of each others’ work
                        are encouraged.</p>
                    <p>5. The essential elements of the policy, courses of action and arguments will
                        be set forth in a paper; the Task Forces will focus their efforts
                        particularly on making an effective oral presentation to the National
                        Security Council, using maps, charts and other visual aids to the maximum
                        extent.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV. Security</p>
                    <p>The highest security should be maintained concerning the existence of the

                        a suitable “cover plan”. Special identity passes should be issued to all
                        persons working on the project, and the area in which they work should be
                        under special security guard.</p>

                            that this policy would be interpreted and administered on the following bases:<list>
                                <item>(1) Time can be used to the advantage of the free world, if we

                                    a period of years, Soviet power will deteriorate or relatively

                                <item>(2) In seeking to deter and oppose further expansion by the
                                    Soviet bloc, the policy would include the utilization of
                                    military operations, as necessary and feasible, even at the
                                    grave risk of general war. However, an attempt would be made to

                                    so as to form a continuous line around the Soviet bloc beyond
                                    which the U.S. will not permit Soviet or satellite military
                                    forces to advance without general war;</item>
                                <item>(2) To make clear to the Soviet rulers in an appropriate and

                                    should be met at the outset by general military action against
                                    both the Soviet Union and China or only against the one most

                                <item>(3) The nature of the measures to be taken by the U.S. in

                            U.S. security, without consideration of present obligations, sentiment
                            or past association; (2) determine to what extent the flexibility and
                            capabilities of the U.S. would be affected by reducing its commitments
                            and permitting it to act without consulting a large group of allies or
                            associated states; (3) analyze the degree to <pb xml:id="pg_366" n="366"
                                facs="0396"/>which Soviet strength would be enhanced or dissipated
                            by specific extensions of its territorial limits or political controls
                            which might result from such a policy.</item>
                        <item>d. As an additional phase, the Task Force will explore the effect of a
                            complete isolation or outlawry of the Soviet bloc from the rest of the
                            world. This policy would accept the risk of military conflict between
                            the world community and the “outlaw” bloc, but it would attempt to make
                            as costly as possible the decision of the Soviet bloc not to conform to
                            the minimum standards of conduct essential to peaceful co-existence. The
                            Iron Curtain countries would be sealed off for all political, economic,
                            cultural and other purposes which may be advantageous to them; Iron
                            Curtain countries would not participate in international organizations
                            and could claim no protections or benefits from international law. The
                            policy would envisage, in effect, two worlds.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council of
                        the background of this report, and called the Council’s attention to the
                        ancillary report <pb xml:id="pg_368" n="368" facs="0398"/>from the Joint
                        Chiefs and others, commenting on it. He also briefly indicated the
                        objectives of General Bull’s committee on continental defense, which was
                        expected to have its report ready in mid-July.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards thereupon briefed the Council with respect to the highlights
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of General Edwards’ briefing, the President observed that
                        of the possible bases from which the Soviets might launch an atomic attack
                        on the United States, those on the Chukotski Peninsula, across the Bering
                        Straits from Alaska, seemed to him to pose the greatest threat. He wondered,
                        therefore, whether we should not step up our air defenses and air warning
                        system in Alaska specifically, in order to detect and repel such an
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards replied that while this would doubtless be advantageous, it
                        remained true that the enemy could pierce the radar screen and defenses if
                        he flew at low altitudes, and it was very probable that the enemy knew the
                        location of our stations in the area.</p>
                    <p>In that case, said the President, had thought been given to the use of flying
                        radar?</p>
                    <p>General Edwards replied that this had been taken into account in his report,
                        along with picket ships.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to the President that at least the enemy could not know where our
                        flying radar was located. He went on to state that it seemed eminently
                        sensible that our own <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases be kept as
                        unclogged as possible to reduce the length of time necessary to mount a
                        retaliatory attack.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards expressed agreement with the President’s objective, but noted
                        how difficult it was to achieve the objective unless you were on a 24-hour
                        alert.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked, in view of the statements of General Edwards on the
                        routes of approach that Soviet planes might be expected to follow, whether
                        there was really much sense in setting up an elaborate early warning screen
                        in the far northern reaches of Canada. It seemed to him that most of the
                        routes which the Soviets would follow avoided such a screen. The President
                        followed this with an inquiry as to whether General Edwards’ report had
                        taken into account the responsibility of the Canadians in the defense of the
                        continent, since they had talked to him about this during a recent
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards replied that the Canadian contribution had been taken into
                        account in the preparation of his report.</p>
                    <p>The President then commented on the very great advantages which would accrue
                        to our defense if we could really count on two hours of warning. He then
                        asked whether, in our own tests of atomic bombs, we had either planted or
                        dropped a bomb in a masonry <pb xml:id="pg_369" n="369" facs="0399"/>area so
                        that we could derive some information as to the degree of destruction which
                        would be the lot of our large cities.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards said that the report had taken into account whatever
                        available evidence there was on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The President, smiling, turned to General Edwards and observed that in his
                        lifetime he had listened to a great many staff reports. Since he had
                        exchanged the military for civilian life, he seemed to sense a notable
                        improvement in the quality of such reports. He hoped that there was no
                        connection between the two phenomena, but he did wish to congratulate each
                        and every member of the group which had given the Council such an admirable
                        and clear statement on this important subject. The President added that he
                        had perhaps some little doubt as to whether General Edwards and his
                        committee had given sufficient weight, in downgrading Soviet capabilities,
                        to their obvious inferiority and even incompetence in the navigation of
                        planes at long ranges. Anyone who had ever ridden with Soviet pilots could
                        vouch for this incompetence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> then asked General
                        Edwards about the effectiveness of the communications network in spreading
                        warning quickly from the point where an attack was detected.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards described briefly the main elements in the network, and
                        expressed the opinion that much more could be done if systematic use were
                        made of fishing fleets, merchant vessels, other aircraft, and similar
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> then inquired as to
                        the possibility that our intelligence might detect preparations for an
                        attack and provide a few days’ warning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that he
                        did not think that we would get any prior warning through intelligence
                        channels of a Soviet sneak attack. Certainly there could be no guaranty of
                        any such warning.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that it
                        might be possible that, prior to launching an attack, there would be
                        sufficient signs and portents, including increasing tension, redeployment of
                        military forces, and so forth, to provide a warning.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked General Edwards, in a facetious vein, why he and his
                        committee had not turned themselves into Russians and tried to figure out
                        what the Russians were thinking with regard to what the United States could
                        do to them. They must be scared as hell, said the President.</p>
                    <p>General Edwards replied that this exercise was not included in the terms of
                        reference of his report, but he had some ideas on the subject. They boiled
                        down to this: that “any attack on the United States by the Soviets during
                        this period would be an act of desperation and not an exercise of military
                        judgment.”</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_370" n="370" facs="0400"/>
                    <p>The President expressed complete agreement with General Edwards’ statement,
                        and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> observed that it agreed with our
                        intelligence estimate.</p>

                    <p>2. Whereas the emphasis of the first three papers was centered around the
                        direct threat to our national security posed by the Soviet Union, <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/2 placed greater emphasis on the
                        threats to our economy of a long-sustained cold war and the necessity of
                        balancing Federal expenditures with Federal income. The paper you <pb
                            xml:id="pg_371" n="371" facs="0401"/>have before you, <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153, is, therefore, a summary in that it
                        sets forth policies previously contained in four separate papers; it is a
                        “restatement” in that it attempts to synthesize policies relating to an
                        external threat on the one hand and an internal threat on the other. This
                        paper is not the result of a restudy, or review, of basic policy by the
                        Planning Board.</p>
                    <p>3. The paper is divided into three sections: General Considerations, General
                        Objectives, and Courses of Action. It is in the first section that the
                        attempt to synthesize past policy and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        149/2 is most evident, particularly paragraph 1 and those sentences of
                        paragraph 4 at the top of page 4. Therein it is stated that we must continue
                        to give primary emphasis to the threat of Soviet power and at the same time
                        recognize that increased emphasis on sound fiscal policy may involve
                        assuming increased risks in relation to this threat.</p>
                    <p>4. Under “General Objectives” the most important paragraph for Council
                        consideration is 8e on page 6. This reads: “To prevent further expansion of
                        Soviet bloc power, even at the grave risk of general war.” We inserted a
                        footnote to this paragraph on the same page as a means of insuring
                        discussion of the issues involved. That footnote adequately explains the

                        request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Their war plans are based on these
                        objectives; and numerous attempts have failed to date to produce more
                        generally satisfactory war objectives.</p>

                    <p>1. In response to the request in your memorandum dated June 4, 1953,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">Not found in Department of State files.</note>
                        subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have examined the draft
                        statement of policy by the National Security Council Planning Board entitled
                        “Restatement of Basic National Security Policy” (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 153) and submit the following views thereon.</p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are in general agreement with those aspects of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153 having military
                        implications.</p>
                    <p>3. With respect to subparagraph 8–e and the footnote at the bottom of page 6
                        of the draft statement of policy, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                        the general objective “To prevent further expansion of Soviet bloc power . .
                        .” should not be qualified by the <pb xml:id="pg_373" n="373" facs="0403"
                        />limitation “in key areas.” Accordingly, they would favor the adoption of
                        subparagraph 8–e as now phrased.</p>
                    <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of view, recommend that
                        you concur in the adoption of the draft statement of policy contained in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> traced the development

                        153 <pb xml:id="pg_374" n="374" facs="0404"/>would supersede all the earlier
                        policy statements on this subject since the year 1948 and including <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149/2. However, he called the Council’s
                        attention to the fact that the present report contained an Annex listing
                        United States objectives in the event of war with the Soviet Union, which
                        had been taken from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4. These
                        objectives would accordingly remain valid, and the Planning Board had
                        undertaken a reconsideration of them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then read aloud to the
                        members of the Council the General Considerations and General Objectives set
                        forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153, in the course of which he
                        explained the difference of views with respect to paragraph 8–e. He noted
                        that this split had been discussed with the President by himself and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GLEASONSE1">Gleason</persName> when they had
                        briefed the President in preparation for this meeting. At that time the
                        President had suggested the wording “to prevent significant forcible
                        expansion of Soviet bloc power even at the grave risk of general war.” The
                        Planning Board had adopted the use of the word “significant”, but were
                        reluctant to accept the word “forcible”, since the Planning Board believed
                        that the addition of this word seriously weakened the objective because it
                        might permit Soviet expansion in key areas through internal subversion as
                        opposed to external aggression.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the President interposed to explain to the Council his reasons
                        for suggesting the inclusion of the term “forcible”. The point he was
                        making, said the President, was that if some free world country, such as
                        Italy, were actually to elect a Communist government, he did not see how we
                        could do anything to prevent its exercise of power.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        his agreement with the President’s view that if by a free election a country
                        went Communist, the United States could not start a war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, in reply, agreed with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s point,
                        but insisted that in the contingency he was talking about, the United States
                        might very well take certain measures which would involve serious risk of
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that as he
                        understood the objective set forth in paragraph 8–e, it meant that the
                        United States would undertake certain efforts to prevent further significant
                        expansion of Soviet power, even at the risk of war. This would not mean,
                        however, that we would necessarily go to war, but rather that we would take
                        actions which the Soviets, if they chose, could consider a <hi rend="italic"
                            >casus belli.</hi> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> emphasized the great irritation which the Soviets had
                        evinced when the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance was formed
                        and when the Japanese Peace Treaty was signed. Despite their anger they had
                        not, however, gone to war, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> thought <pb xml:id="pg_375" n="375" facs="0405"/>that
                        the present paragraph should at least make it clear that the United States
                        is not going to refrain from doing what it ought to do simply because
                        certain of its actions might serve the Soviets as a pretext for war.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion and suggestions for rephrasing paragraph 8–e,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> read to the
                        Council a version which he had written and which the President and the other
                        members of the Council agreed to accept.</p>
                    <p>The President closed this phase of the discussion with a warning that the
                        United States should not permit itself to be frozen to certain positions in
                        advance of events. With respect to the contingencies involved in paragraph
                        8–e, the United States would have to decide its position in the light of the
                        situation existing at the time.</p>
                    <p>After various other verbal changes had been made by the Council, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said that he was unhappy
                        about the phrasing of paragraph 11 as it applied to the development of an
                        early warning system. It was not accurate to state that we should
                        “accelerate” an early warning system, since the Defense Department had not
                        yet reached firm conclusions as to the feasibility of an early warning
                        system and the report of the Kelly Committee had indicated difficulties and
                        delays in the creation of such a system. It was accordingly agreed to fall
                        back on the language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 149 and to
                        substitute “emphasize” instead of “accelerate”.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> then inquired
                        of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> whether his
                        comments on the Kelly Report must lead us to assume that it was impossible
                        to achieve an effective early warning system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> replied in the
                        negative, but again pointed out the unresolved problems in this area and his
                        conviction that one could not accelerate something which had not yet come
                        into existence. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>
                        stated that the Defense Department strongly favored the creation of a sound
                        system of early warning, but that he was very anxious that the new Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff should review the whole problem of continental defense
                        before the Defense Department went ahead with any specific program to
                        achieve a given interval of early warning. There was still grave doubt in
                        his mind as to whether it was right to single out and go ahead on the early
                        warning component of continental defense, without synchronizing this with
                        the remaining parts of a continental defense program.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> then turned to
                        paragraph 12, dealing with non-military measures to strengthen the defense
                        position of the United States, and read a suggested change in the wording of
                        the paragraph. He felt it was not timely merely to go forward with
                        preparations for reducing urban vulnerability, but that the time was at hand
                        for a policy statement directing measures to reduce urban vulnerability.
                        What he had in mind, said Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1"
                            >Peterson</persName>, <pb xml:id="pg_376" n="376" facs="0406"/>did not
                        involve expenditures of Federal funds to disperse installations and lessen
                        their vulnerability, but rather use by the Government of its very
                        considerable financial power to gain compliance by the companies in
                        reasonable dispersal of critical facilities. In short, if the owners of
                        these facilities refused to cooperate with the Government, we could, for
                        example, withhold defense contracts from them.</p>
                    <p>Reminding the Council of his considerable experience at the local level with
                        problems like this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>
                        stressed his conviction that it would be a very dangerous policy to refuse
                        defense contracts to companies who, for one reason or another, did not
                        comply with this vulnerability policy. It was often impractical and wasteful
                        to scatter the various component parts of an organization which produced
                        defense products. A promotion campaign to stress the desirability, when
                        practical, of dispersion was, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>’ mind, a far better means of reducing urban
                        vulnerability than Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1"
                            >Peterson</persName>’s suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> replied that
                        he was far from desiring to impose any impractical solution of this problem,
                        but it seemed to him clear that we could no longer continue to pile up
                        factories and populations in congested and exposed areas, and that there
                        accordingly must be more dispersion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> replied that he
                        certainly was a believer in dispersion, but at the same time was strongly
                        opposed to dissipation. In the name of dispersion we have often set up
                        facilities in remote areas which resulted in poor production and very high
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>The President reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName> that in the present situation it was unfortunately
                        necessary to give up maximum efficiency of operation in order to obtain
                        maximum security. This was a many-sided problem, and we must not
                        oversimplify it. What we required in this paragraph was language which would
                        show that in all facets of our life we are proposing to use the power of the
                        Federal Government to get people to do the sensible thing. As the President
                        understood it, this was what Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1"
                            >Peterson</persName> wanted.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> replied that he
                        simply did not like the force idea with respect to defense contracts. He
                        stated that the Defense Department would cooperate to the hilt with Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> to achieve a more
                        positive approach to the problem of reducing urban vulnerability.</p>
                    <p>In turn, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName>
                        expressed understanding of the difficulties which Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> foresaw, and emphasized that what
                        he sought in paragraph 12 was not a specific program of implementation, but
                        merely a general policy statement as a guide. Once this policy statement had
                        been made, he would do his best to implement it in a sound and sensible
                        way.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_377" n="377" facs="0407"/>
                    <p>After further discussion, Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> suggested the adoption of the statement proposed by
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName>, subject to
                        the inclusion of the word “feasible”. The President and the Council agreed
                        with this amendment.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> then suggested
                        the inclusion of a new paragraph 31, which would give the necessary emphasis
                        to the Secretary of State’s desire to extend the good offices of the United
                        States in helping to smooth the difficult relationships between some of our
                        allies and their colonial or semi-colonial dependents.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        the United States must assert itself in order to assure an orderly evolution
                        toward freedom for such peoples, and not appear to contradict its own
                        traditions as a supporter of the <hi rend="italic">status quo.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President and the Council expressed approval of the idea advanced by
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, and suggested
                        that his draft language be checked with the Secretary of State and
                        thereafter be included as a new paragraph 31.</p>

                    <p>Top Secret</p>
                    <p rend="center">Restatement of Basic National Security Policy</p>
                    <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                    <p>1. There are two principal threats to the survival of fundamental values and
                        institutions of the United States:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The formidable power and aggressive policy of the communist world
                            led by the USSR.</item>
                        <item>b. The serious weakening of the economy of the United States that may
                            result from the cost of opposing the Soviet threat over a sustained
                            period.</item>
                        <item>The basic problem facing the United States is to strike a proper
                            balance between the risks arising from these two threats.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. In recognition of the Soviet threat, the United States has been engaged in
                        building up its own and free world strength, in order to block Soviet
                        expansion, make possible an affirmative foreign policy, and deter general
                        war, or if war comes, survive the initial shock and go on to victory. This
                        policy is based on the premise that creation by the free world of situations
                        of strength might lead the USSR to modify its behavior, and that eventually
                        the internal conflicts of the Soviet totalitarian system, with positive
                        effort from us, <pb xml:id="pg_380" n="380" facs="0410"/>might cause a
                        retraction and decay of Soviet power. This policy rejects both preventive
                        war and isolation.</p>
                    <p>3. A vital factor in the long-term survival of the free world is the
                        maintenance by the United States of a sound, strong economy. Efforts to
                        build up free world strength rapidly have resulted in a high rate of Federal
                        spending in excess of Federal income, at a time of heavy taxation.
                        Continuation of this course of action over a long period of time would place
                        the United States in danger of seriously weakening its economy and
                        destroying the values and institutions which it is seeking to maintain.
                        Accordingly, in recognition of this danger, greater emphasis than heretofore
                        must now be placed on budgetary, credit, and fiscal policies designed to
                        maintain the strength and soundness of the U.S. economy. However, if a basic
                        change in the world situation should occur, these policies would be subject
                        to review.</p>
                    <p>4. This new emphasis does not imply a belief that the Soviet threat to the
                        free world is diminishing. On the contrary:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The Soviet orbit has formidable and growing military, economic, and
                            political capabilities, including in particular an atomic capability and
                            a possible thermonuclear capability which will probably become
                            sufficient in the next few years to damage critically the United States
                            and its allies.</item>
                        <item>b. Although there is continuing danger of general war, the most
                            immediate danger facing the United States is that a progressive and
                            cumulative loss of positions of importance to the United States (either
                            as a result of deterioration within the free nations, or of communist
                            cold war actions, or of a process involving both) could eventually
                            reduce the United States, short of general war, to an isolated and
                            critically vulnerable position.</item>
                        <item>c. The increasingly destructive power available to the Soviet Union,
                            the development of over-all Soviet production potential, and the
                            allocation by the USSR of a much greater proportion of its resources to
                            war purposes, make it impossible for the free world to assign the same
                            weight as in the past to its economic potential as the determining
                            factor in final victory.</item>
                        <item>d. In deciding whether or in what manner to exercise its capabilities,
                            the USSR is not restrained by moral considerations, by constitutional
                            procedures or by the necessity of consulting with allies.</item>
                        <item>e. Although the USSR has recently assumed a more conciliatory posture
                            in its dealings with the West, there is no basis for concluding that the
                            fundamental hostility of the Kremlin toward the West has abated, that
                            the ultimate objectives of the Soviet rulers have changed, or that the
                            menace of communism to the free world has diminished.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Consequently the United States must continue to give primary consideration to
                        the threat of Soviet power. But the threat to the U.S. economy cannot be
                        neglected. At the same time, we must recognize that increased emphasis on
                        sound fiscal policy may involve assuming <pb xml:id="pg_381" n="381"
                            facs="0411"/>increased risks in relation to the Soviet threat, and will
                        therefore increase the importance of more careful balance and improved
                        efficiency in the various national security programs.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviet orbit also has marked disadvantages and vulnerabilities
                        vis-à-vis the free world. Because the Soviet system relies heavily on
                        falsehood, compulsion and rigid centralized control machinery, it has built
                        up disillusionment and resentment in the USSR, and even more in the
                        satellites. For some period of time, the difficulties and uncertainties
                        involved in the transition from the old to the new regime will increase
                        these and other vulnerabilities inherent in the Soviet system. The USSR is,
                        and for the foreseeable future will remain, inferior to the free world in
                        available resources and productive capacity. The Soviet orbit is also
                        vulnerable to developing U.S. atomic and thermonuclear capabilities.</p>
                    <p>6. In the light of all these factors, the greatest safeguard to the security
                        of the United States and the free world continues to be the achievement and
                        maintenance of integrated political, military, and economic power providing
                        the United States with an over-all strength sufficient, together with our
                        spiritual determination, to deter or win general war, prevent or counter
                        communist aggression, and permit the exploitation of Soviet bloc
                        vulnerabilities.</p>
                    <p rend="center">General Objectives</p>
                    <p>7. One purpose underlies every national security policy: to maintain the
                        fundamental values and institutions of the United States, which rest on the
                        essential dignity and worth of the individual in a free society.</p>
                    <p>8. To achieve this fundamental purpose, in view of the dual threat facing us,
                        we set the following objectives:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To create and maintain sufficient strength, both military and
                            nonmilitary, to provide for the security of the United States, assist in
                            the defense of vital areas of the free world, prevent or counter
                            aggression, deter general war, protect the continental United States,
                            and provide the basis for winning a general war if one should be forced
                            on us.</item>
                        <item>b. To maintain a sound and strong U.S. economy based on free
                            enterprise.</item>
                        <item>c. To maintain free U.S. political institutions supported by an
                            informed public opinion.</item>
                        <item>d. To strengthen the will and ability of other nations of the free
                            world, individually and collectively, to deter or oppose communist

                        military and other operations to create conditions which would permit
                        satisfactory accomplishment of U.S. objectives without a predetermined
                        requirement for unconditional surrender. War aims supplemental to our

                        <item>a. Eliminating Soviet Russian domination in areas outside the borders

                            war on comparable terms with any other regime or regimes which may exist
                            on traditional Russian territory.</item>

                                <item>(1) Prevent the development of power relationships dangerous
                                    to the security of the United States and international

                        administration of government within enemy territory, independence for
                        national minorities, or post-war responsibility for the readjustment of the

                    <p>Top Secret</p>
                    <p>I discussed with the President today the presentation of Solarium
                        Project.</p>
                    <p>The President believes he will be back from Bermuda<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d74fn1">The proposed tripartite conference at Bermuda, scheduled
                            for late June 1953, was postponed until December due to the illness of

                        if the Solarium people are ready, the regular Council day of Thursday, July
                        16, be set apart for the Solarium presentation. I have asked Tom Stephens
                        tentatively to reserve that entire day for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes to begin at 8:30 a.m., to allow to each Team two hours
                        for its presentation, to have a break between presentations, and a break for
                        lunch, and to have all questions reserved until the conclusion. Thus the
                        schedule would run something as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>8:30 to 10:30—Task Force A</item>
                        <item>10:30 to 10:45—Break</item>
                        <item>10:45 to 12:45—Task Force B</item>
                        <item>12:45 to 2:15—Luncheon</item>
                        <item>2:15 to 4:15—Task Force C</item>
                        <item>4:15 to 4:30—Break</item>
                        <item>4:30 and thereafter as long as might be needed: Questions</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The President thought that if the Task Forces coordinated their presentations
                        to some extent by reviewing them together before the presentation day, a lot
                        of duplication could be avoided. He thought that two hours per Task Force
                        would undoubtedly be sufficient time, because undoubtedly some of the
                        material for each Task Force would be covered by the earlier Task
                        Forces.</p>
                    <p>The President made a point that he wanted the maximum time for questions. He
                        thought that if questions were permitted after each Task Force presentation,
                        such questions would tend to cut into the later presentations.</p>
                    <p>I suggested to the President that we put the presentation on in the theater
                        in the basement of the White House. He wanted to be sure that the room was
                        airconditioned, and that there was a platform. He inquired whether they
                        would want to use slides. Of course they will use a lot of charts and maps.
                        I am not sure that the lighting is as good in the theater as it might be. I
                        think I will inquire of the Usher as to what other large room might be
                        available. There <pb xml:id="pg_388" n="388" facs="0418"/>will be in
                        attendance, in addition to the Council personnel, numbering normally about
                        13, three Task Force Teams totaling 21, and very likely 5 or 6 other
                        persons, like General Craig, General <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGWB1"
                            >Smith</persName>, Skip Koons, etc.</p>
                    <p>I did not speak to the President about the desirability of giving luncheon to
                        all of these people in the White House, in order that their ingress and
                        outgo would not be noticed by people on the outside.</p>

                            was to enable each task force chairman to sum up in general the major
                            themes they would develop. However, it should be noted that although
                            this may be said to be a fairly good indication of the line which will
                            be taken by each task force, there is considerable disagreement on many
                            points between the members of the task forces and the chairmen, and
                            accordingly the points made by the chairmen should not be considered as

                            378</ref>.</note> We have studied the latter carefully and have come to
                        the conclusion that a definite improvement in results can be achieved within
                        this framework. We accept the general terms of the objectives. Whether or
                        not time is on our side will be analyzed from various aspects but our
                        position is generally that this concept only has meaning in terms of what
                        we, the U.S., will do with it.</p>
                    <p>The continued maintenance of U.S. military strength to meet and deter Soviet
                        threat will be proposed. War is not inevitable. It need not be regarded
                        either as most likely or probable. Whether it is to come or not will depend
                        much on our own action. Task Force A will not be able to come to grips with
                        the budgetary problem as it relates to the foreign policy to be proposed,
                        but will indicate certain <pb xml:id="pg_389" n="389" facs="0419"/>studies
                        which might be made by the Administration in order to make final decisions
                        in this matter easier.</p>
                    <p>On the question of the relation of our defense effort to domestic economic
                        problems, the position will be stressed that the U.S. economy can stand for
                        a considerable length of time a higher level of defense expenditures than
                        the currently operative ones. If a higher level of defense spending is
                        possible politically, it is possible economically.</p>
                    <p>The question of the maintenance of American free institutions will be
                        discussed frankly. Greater frankness with the American people will be
                        recommended. Emphasis [will be] on respectful and sympathetic treatment of
                        our allies’ problems. Attention called to the effect of our internal
                        security measures on public opinion abroad. Modifications will be
                        proposed.</p>
                    <p>On the problem of strengthening the free world, the danger of having blanket
                        policies is to be noted. We must discriminate between countries and
                        conditions.</p>

                        situations are not very materially improved. Watch opportunities for

                    <p>Some ideas on using the UN better will be set forth. The question of
                        negotiations with the USSR have not yet been discussed by the task force.
                        With regard to the Soviet peace offensive the emphasis may be placed on the
                        big responsibility of the U.S. not to appear as a result as the party that
                        does not want an end to the Cold War.</p>

                        should help to ease their prestige problem.</p>

                            >McCormack</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>B’s approach will be a rather rigid one in order not to muddy the water
                        between B and A. For the sake of clarity certain interpretations are put on
                        the instructions. In the “completing the line” instruction the change is
                        made by defining “General war” as war in which the full weight of U.S.
                        resources is committed to securing the defeat of the Soviet bloc including
                        the USSR, the Satellites, and Red China. Secondly, “to make clear to the
                        Soviet rulers”, this change of policy is understood to mean making
                        “publicly” clear. Since one of the great assets of this policy is the
                        stabilization it would bring to the U.S. and its allies, merely to inform
                        the USSR secretly would not be satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>In general the line is moved up to the Soviet periphery. This gives a moral
                        justification in reacting to aggression, leaving countries outside the line
                        who have not yet fallen poses disturbing problems for those countries and is
                        questionable morally.</p>
                    <p>The question of drawing a line to include only the minimum allies necessary
                        to U.S. security will be investigated. However, it is felt that such a
                        withdrawal and limitation of the line would be of little use. The present
                        military capabilities of the U.S. depend much on overseas bases in foreign
                        countries all over the world. The withdrawal of guarantees against
                        aggression to these allies would perhaps mean a gain of political freedom to
                        the U.S., but this would be more than offset if we lost the bases.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economy Aspect</p>
                    <p>It will be contended that alternative C will require much more money than the
                        present level of expenditures but that B need not involve a necessarily
                        higher level than A. Furthermore, B enables the creation of a greater
                        regularity and rationality with regard to expenditures than A. There will be
                        an economy in defense preparations since the military forces will be
                        conserved as being the best forces to wage general war, i.e., not forces
                        specialized to win war, <pb xml:id="pg_391" n="391" facs="0421"/>say in
                        Indo-China. There will be a much greater cohesion in the defense effort.</p>
                    <p>The policy is considered as being essentially a unilateral one. It will be
                        discussed with our allies and every effort made to get them to go along with
                        it, but the policy would be carried through regardless of their
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>The Task Force was instructed to examine the two world thesis. B’s policy
                        already puts a military seal around the Soviet Union but it is felt that an
                        economic one will not work. The latter could at best only delay Soviet bloc
                        economic build-up and would at the same time create too many difficulties to
                        be feasible.</p>
                    <p>Alternative B is envisaged as the policy least likely to cause general war.
                        Illustration: Peripheral wars (Korea, Indo-China) can happen under A; under
                        B they cannot. Under B you need only small forces along the actual periphery
                        to maintain some semblance of order. Task Force B will probably take the
                        attitude that the U.S. does have the preponderance of force now and can
                        continue to maintain it without denying that the Soviets can improve
                        relatively their position.</p>

                        stated that in some places the line might “ebb and flow” a bit as situations
                        changed. The essence of Policy B is that it adds to Policy A the sanction of
                        general war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KENNANGF1">Kennan</persName> remarked
                        that general war was not excluded from the considerations of A. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCCORMACKMGJJ1">McCormack</persName> replied that
                        the principle was different. B involved a commitment and “a clear warning”
                        of general war.</p>
                    <p>It is felt probable that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations
                        would fall into line since it is doubtful that there would not be some

                        resistance to aggression if the line was crossed. Any nation so wobbly as
                        not to follow such a policy most probably is doomed to fall off our band
                        wagon sooner or later anyway. Policy B gives the best chances that war will
                        be deterred for the longest possible time.</p>
                    <p>Impossible at the minute to apply it to Korea or Indo-China but “our policy

                    <p>Admits that Task Force C is somewhat behind the others, particularly in
                        getting things on paper.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet threat will be assessed and it will be concluded that the U.S.
                        cannot live with the Soviet Union if the latter’s present increasing
                        strength continues. Hence, this strength will be attacked with the objective
                        of its reduction. Provided our military posture is strong enough no
                        overwhelming risks of general war are envisaged. The initiative must be
                        seized and general political warfare conducted on the Soviet Union. There
                        are two basic requirements: an adequate military posture (build-up); the
                        preparation of public opinion, Congress, leadership, and our allies to go
                        along with such a policy. Our reward in the results cannot be calculated in
                        terms of economic cost. In starting this campaign in general our war
                        objectives as set forth in 153/1 are accepted with some modification. The
                        time period envisaged is 10 years, which does not mean that we would have
                        been successful at the end of this time, but that we would be at least in a
                        position where we could see the end of the task. At some time during this
                        period before the enemy has the maximum atomic potential the tempo of our
                        attack must increase in order to turn the tide. Chiang Kai-shek<note n="3"

                        and help insure the success of an operation to clean out Indo-China. An
                        attempt will be made to drive a wedge between China and the USSR. The former
                        will be blockaded and other measures will be used in order to make China an
                        expensive ally to the USSR and to make it painful for China.</p>
                    <p>As regards Korea, Task Force C’s position is generally one that they hope the
                        hostilities would continue since then they would be enabled to recommend a
                        final offensive to conclude the war on the Yalu and/or to destroy and
                        capture in Korea a large part of the Chinese army and its supplies. C would
                        also make some use of B’s technique of threatening the sanction of general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>As regards negotiations with the Soviet Union, Task Force C will not accept
                        the sincerity of any offers of the Soviets short of those fulfilling U.S.
                        war aims as set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1.</p>

                        that with the initial success of the policy more support would be
                        forthcoming from the allies and others, and eventually this support would
                        snowball as the Soviets retreated. No offensive action to be taken until
                        adequate defense posture achieved to enable successful prosecution of a
                        general war. B’s assumption about eliminating peripheral <pb xml:id="pg_393"
                            n="393" facs="0423"/>wars is questioned. Undoubtedly any general war
                        would involve peripheral wars (theaters of minor operations).</p>
                    <p>The implementation of this policy in the U.S. Government requires the ability
                        to act and respond quickly with much more vigor and rapid pace than is now
                        the case. The U.S. will want to be prepared for a “break through”, and be
                        able to react in hours, not days. The military build-up of the U.S. should
                        be predicated on the assumption that this program can be completed in 10
                        years but at the end of that time, success can be foreseen in the not too
                        distant future. On the other hand, the time might be less since it is
                        possible that after the first set-backs, Soviet power might become
                        demoralized and rapidly collapse.</p>
                    <p>Task Force C denies the assertion that the internal threat is of equal
                        gravity to the external threat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KENNANGF1">Kennan</persName> remarked that A has

                        that C would assume the risk of general war much more than A, and that

                            together of the major institutions of the armed forces, including the
                            great atomic energy plants. He wanted us thoroughly to familiarize

                            of information, he then wanted us to make a completely new, fresh survey

                    <p>I. At the conclusion of the question period the President made a statement to
                        all those in attendance:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1) He never attended a better or more persuasively presented staff
                            job.</item>
                        <item>2) He thought that there were many similarities in the three
                            presentations, which he felt more important than the differences between
                            them.</item>
                        <item>3) He thought that the only thing worse than losing a global war was
                            winning one; that there would be no individual freedom after the next
                            global war.</item>
                        <item>4) If you demand of a free people over a long period of time more than
                            they want to give, you can obtain what you want only by using more and
                            more controls; and the more you do this, the more you lose the
                            individual liberty which you are trying to save and become a garrison
                            state (American model).</item>
                        <item>5) The American people have demonstrated their reluctance after a war
                            is ended to take the necessary action properly to occupy the territory
                            conquered in order to gain our legitimate ends. What would we do with
                            Russia, if we should win in a global war?</item>
                        <item>6) The United States has to persuade her allies to go along with her,
                            because our forward bases are in the territories of our allies.</item>
                        <item>7) If we are to obtain more money in taxes, there must be a vigorous
                            campaign to educate the people—and to educate the people of our
                            allies.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The President indicated that there was still more for the Task Forces to
                        do:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a) a mass meeting of the Task Forces to see if they could agree on
                            certain features of the three presentations as the best features and to
                            bring about a combination of such features into a unified policy.</item>
                        <item>b) consider arranging a presentation to Congressional leaders,
                            recognizing that certain parts would have to be sanitized.</item>
                        <item>c) prepare an outline of a major policy plan to be adopted.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>II. At a joint meeting with the Task Forces after the President left:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>i) The Task Forces (especially A and C) were in strong disagreement.
                            The bases upon which each approached the problems differed; the Teams
                            differed on the intentions and objectives of the Russians. While there
                            were external similarities, they knew from 6 weeks’ association that
                            they could not agree. It was not only that <pb xml:id="pg_398" n="398"
                                facs="0428"/>they were tired and had over-delayed commitments, some
                            of them; there were fundamental differences which could be compromised
                            into a watered-down position but not really agreed to.</item>
                        <item>ii) As to presenting to Congress the material, Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_CONOLLYARL1">Conolly</persName> said that it would be
                            necessary to sanitize his presentation 90% and take all the specific
                            validity out of it. General <persName corresp="#p_MCCORMACKMGJJ1"
                                >McCormack</persName> indicated that it would be necessary to
                            sanitize the basic conception of his paper—drawing a line around
                            Russia.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>III. When I reported this back to the President, he seemed very put out and
                        left it to me to work out what I thought best. He told me to tell the Vice
                        President not to go forward with the presentation of the facts and left me
                        the working out of the other details. These matters will be worked out
                        accordingly as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. The Special Staff of the National Security Council will make a
                            summary of the principal points in three presentations and in the
                            question and answer period.</item>
                        <item>2. On July 21, if possible, selected personnel from each Task Force
                            will review the summary for correctness, improvement, and uniformity.
                            Mr. Koons is obtaining from each Task Force Captain the availability of
                            the members of each Task Force. Apparently, there will be 3 to 5 members
                            of each Task Force constantly available in Washington.</item>
                        <item>3. The summary, as thus corrected, will be presented to the Council at
                            its meeting on July 23; with a request that it be studied by the Council
                            members and their <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Assistants so that
                            at the Council Meeting on July 30, the subject-matter could be discussed
                            with a view toward, <list>
                                <item>a. designating the areas which the Council wishes to have

                                <item>b. directing the Planning Board to prepare recommendations in
                                    those areas.</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Planning Board, in preparing these recommendations would utilize the
                        services of Task Force Members available in Washington.<note n="4"

                    <p>a. As directed, the policy of the U.S. would be:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) To maintain over a sustained period armed forces to provide for
                            the security of the United States and to assist in the defense of vital
                            areas of the free world;</item>
                        <item>(2) To continue to assist in building up the economic and military
                            strength and cohesion of the free world; and</item>
                        <item>(3) Without materially increasing the risk of general war, to continue
                            to exploit the vulnerabilities of the Soviets and their satellites by
                            political, economic and psychological measures.</item>

                    <p>b. For purposes of analysis and study by the Task Force, it is assumed that
                        this policy would be interpreted and administered on the following
                        bases:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Time can be used to the advantage of the free world; if we can
                            build up and maintain the strength of the free world during a period of
                            years, Soviet power will deteriorate or relatively decline to a point
                            which no longer constitutes a threat to the security of the United
                            States and to world peace.</item>
                        <item>(2) In seeking to deter and oppose further expansion by the Soviet
                            bloc, the policy would include the utilization of military operations,
                            as necessary and feasible, even at the grave risk of general war.
                            However, an attempt would be made to localize such military operations
                            as far as possible.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Method of Approach</p>
                    <p>Task Force A arrived at the conclusion that there are areas in which
                        significant improvements could be made within the framework of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1.<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Dated
                            June 10, <ref target="#pg_378">p. 378</ref>.</note> The Task Force
                        believed that we have reached a critical point in the application of our
                        grand strategy, and in the Soviet situation, which marks a phase line. Task
                        Force A believes the U.S. is today in a position to assume the strategic
                        offensive in its conflict with Soviet Communism. The U.S. should move
                        forward from today’s phase line to rectify imperfections in our strategy;
                        give it new confidence, boldness and constructiveness; recapture
                        flexibility; effect better integration; and improve implementation. It is
                        felt that the policy thus revised would give the greatest assurance as
                        against other possible alternatives for the successful disintegration of the
                        Soviet threat without recourse to general war, and without increasing the
                        risk of general war.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Analysis of the Soviet Threat</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union has developed a strong and dangerous military posture
                        serving political leadership we recognize as hostile, resentful of American
                        power, dedicated to aims incompatible with our security. The threatening
                        quality of this military posture arises from the strength and disposition of
                        these forces, coupled with the attitude of the Soviet political leaders, and
                        above all, their ideological commitment to the destruction of western
                        capitalism in processes which involve at some point the use of violence.
                        Soviet predominance in eastern and central Europe makes impossible a
                        restoration of normal conditions of full stability to Europe as a whole, and
                        has contributed extensively to the development of the military posture we
                        find disturbing. Furthermore, the possibility exists that additional nations
                        will be brought under communist control through the activities of indigenous
                        communist factions, acting with or <pb xml:id="pg_401" n="401" facs="0431"
                        />without overt support from Moscow. In addition to the military threat
                        posed by conventional Soviet armaments there is increasing evidence that the
                        Soviet Union is developing a strong capability in the field of weapons of
                        mass destruction. If this process continues unimpeded, the Soviet leaders
                        will soon have it in their power to inflict massive damage on the cities,
                        industries and facilities of this country and its major allies, although
                        presumably not without suffering retaliation in kind.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Other Elements in the World Situation</p>
                    <p>There are two other basic factors in the situation which must be considered.
                        One is the rising discontent and resentment against the West, particularly
                        in Asia, and the demands for rapid social and economic change which
                        characterize the so-called socio-economic “revolution” which exists
                        throughout the world. This exists quite apart from Soviet-Communist threat
                        but is effectively exploited by Communism. The second is the reduction of
                        the bi-polarity which has dominated the world situation since 1945, and is
                        indicated by a decline in U.S. prestige and leadership during the past
                        several years, growing independence of action by other free nations and, on
                        the Soviet side, developments which have had a somewhat comparable effect in
                        weakening Moscow’s range of influence. Both of <pb xml:id="pg_402" n="402"
                            facs="0432"/>these considerations must be met with positive and
                        constructive policies which utilize, rather than oppose them. They point to
                        the crucial importance which may attach to courses of U.S. action in the
                        immediately forthcoming period. Thus Task Force A sees, in this regard:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. As the first principle, the U.S. to avoid policies which give
                            impression it is solely pursuing aims which have essentially wartime
                            objectives and that it feels war is inevitable;</item>
                        <item>b. As the second principle, the U.S. to create the impression of
                            steadiness and reliability in formulation and implementation of foreign
                            policy; and</item>
                        <item>c. As the third principle, the positive emphasis of U.S. policy to be
                            placed on strengthening U.S. position with other free world countries
                            and in the creation of strength and confidence in free world.</item>

                    <p>a. Maintenance of U.S. strength</p>
                    <p>The risk of general war is not high. Acceptance, however, of a calculated
                        risk that the Soviet Union will not resort to war, which would lead to a
                        reduction in our defense establishment cannot be accepted. Our military
                        program should continue to be related to Soviet military capabilities for
                        general war, and not become captive to the zigzags of Soviet political
                        policy. The Task Force came to the tentative conclusion in regard to present
                        mobilization plans that the portion of the economy proposed for allocation
                        to the war effort in the event of full mobilization is too high to be
                        realistic (a peak of 66 percent of the gross national product) and
                        recommended study by the responsible agencies.</p>
                    <p>b. Peripheral war may be increasingly unlikely in the near and mid-term
                        future. However, U.S. efforts to prepare military, political and
                        psychological deterrents to aggression should include:</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Costs</p>
                    <p>a. The main internal threat seen by Task Force A is the danger of lack of
                        constancy in our security program. A creeping disarmament might prove even
                        more dangerous than was the outcome of post World War II demobilization.
                        Positive actions must be initiated to draw public support so as to link
                        various components of the Soviet threat with the services, sacrifices,
                        tax-payments, etc., which the U.S. people need to provide to meet that
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>b. It is difficult to see how the military build-up of ourselves and our
                        allies programmed until the end of last year can in fact be effected under
                        current forward budget planning.</p>
                    <p>c. Out of a summation of those factors which are likely to add up to an
                        increase, it is estimated that the cost of Task Force A’s course of national
                        policy will exceed <hi rend="italic">during the build-up period</hi> the
                        funds allocated to the security program as currently contemplated in the
                        most recent budget planning.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_404" n="404" facs="0434"/>
                    <p>d. <hi rend="italic">In the long run</hi> the Task Force program will cost
                        not materially less than about 40 billion annually and may be somewhat
                        higher. There appears no other realistic solution than to maintain a
                        see-through constancy of preparedness until we have had a long continued
                        demonstration that the spirit and intent of Soviet communism has changed—or
                        even longer, until we effectively regulate armaments.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Maintenance of the Economy</p>
                    <p>a. After studying the ability of the economy to sustain the security load,
                        Task Force A concludes that there is no question that our country has the
                            <hi rend="italic">economic capacity</hi> to provide a high plateau of
                        preparedness—certainly the program envisaged by Task Force A— over a
                        sustained period (interpreted as 10 years or more).</p>
                    <p>b. The real threat from the economic standpoint, arises not so much from the
                        absolute cost of security as from other dangers which include:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The effect on adequate legislative action of the unprecedented
                            absolute cost of the peacetime security program.</item>
                        <item>(2) The effect of possible economic recession.</item>
                        <item>(3) Lack of economic readiness for mobilization, general war, and
                            atomic attack on the U.S.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>c. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1 fails to provide directives or
                        policy guidance for those preparatory economic and industrial mobilization
                        arrangements within the executive branch which are consistent with its
                        stated policy of military readiness.</p>
                    <p>d. On the national debt, the main question is whether it is likely to become
                        so high as to be a threat to the strength of the U.S., but any likely threat
                        existent in the debt does not seem comparable to the Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p>e. It is seriously questioned that in the face of an unbalanced budget and
                        the current security need in an economy operating at around full normal
                        capacity, there is any urgent economic argument for reducing the total of
                        federal taxes. The continuation of taxes at the present or higher levels is
                        recommended. The U.S. seems certainly to have the tax structure, debt
                        situation, and general fiscal capability to <hi rend="italic">sustain</hi>
                        the security load which seems likely under the program of Task Force A. The
                        tax problem appears to be primarily a political and psychological problem.
                        This makes it part of the problem of gaining public support for an adequate
                        program for security.</p>
                    <p>f. It is questioned that the economic policy expressed in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1 is based on a completely correct
                        estimate of the true nature of the economic threat to the U.S. way of life

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Maintenance of Free Political Institutions</p>
                    <p>a. U.S. objectives in this field should continue to be:</p>

                    <p>b. There is considerable apprehension abroad that American governmental
                        processes and public life are falling extensively under the influence of
                        psychological and political trends which Europeans regard as totalitarian in
                        nature. It is felt that the full significance of this development has not
                        yet been generally appreciated by our government and public. Unless a
                        drastic reversal of this impression can be achieved the long-term
                        psychological consequences must be expected to be extremely serious; so much
                        so as to nullify a good portion of whatever positive measures the U.S.
                        Government may take to offset the Soviet danger.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">11. Strengthening the Free World</p>
                    <p>a. Success in strengthening the free world is of an especially great
                        significance in the case of the national policy supported by Task Force A,
                        because there is much less of the element of unilateral U.S. action involved

                    <p>b. Task Force A’s case rests on a proposition that the free world can

                        part, the determinant of the future of Europe. A new approach to the problem
                        of German reunification is recommended which can exploit and intensify

                        suggested that U.S. policy should be to repose responsibility on France, and
                        to initiate this policy by removing, progressively and tactfully, the
                        support from the U.S. to which she now looks to bail her out of perennial
                        crises. There should be a carefully worked out course which focuses world
                        opinion at French responsibilities; informs France of our intent gradually
                        to cease supporting French overcommitments; makes clear our intent to regain
                        independence of U.S. action now inhibited by French fears; but stresses our
                        intent to continue to help France in situations she cannot realistically
                        meet alone. High level discussions are needed.</p>

                            advance. We must at the highest political level seek the following
                            commitments from France:</item>
                        <item>(A) To make specific announcement regarding the future relationship of
                            the Associated States with the French Union in order to promote popular
                            support and leadership within Indochina for the war effort.</item>
                        <item>(B) To recognize and fulfill her obligations for the successful
                            defense of Indochina as a crucial front in the struggle of the West
                            against Communist advance.</item>
                        <item>(C) To regain the military initiative against the Viet Minh with
                            revitalized and aggressive military and political leadership.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_410" n="410" facs="0440"/>
                        <item>(D) To provide sufficient French forces in addition to creating
                            effective indigenous forces to bring the Indochina war to an early
                            conclusion, with the recognition that she will not be able to function
                            as the keystone of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as long as
                            Indochina remains a drain on her resources.</item>
                        <item>(E) To permit the U.S. to take an active part in the development and
                            training of the indigenous forces.</item>
                        <item>ii. There is great danger that France, contemplating the eventual loss
                            of her present position in Indochina, will lose the will to continue
                            that costly war. We should therefore undertake the support of a
                            substantial part of the cost of stepping up action. In return we should
                            insist that France and the Associated States contribute to the maximum
                            extent of their capabilities.</item>

                        The U.S. must be careful how we treat such relaxations of the Soviet

                        be built with the understanding that some concessions may be necessary to
                        achieve results, although not at the expense of our overall position of

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Method of Approach</p>
                    <p>a. The policy is, in final analysis unilateral.</p>
                    <p>b. An Aggression which would bring on general war would be no trifling border
                        incident but armed aggression that would be clearly recognized as such by
                        the President and the people of the U.S. as well as the free world as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>c. General war is defined as a war in which the U.S., assisted by those
                        allies it might have at the time, would apply its full power whenever,
                        however, and wherever necessary to defeat the main enemy, and to achieve its
                        other war objectives.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_413" n="413" facs="0443"/>
                    <p>d. Alternative “B” furnishes a new frame for the fabric of U.S. policy, but
                        does not replace the myriad of threads that now go to make up that fabric.
                        Alternative “B” would accept may of the concrete recommendations of
                        Alternatives “A” and “C”, modifying them only as necessary to accommodate
                        one new premise: <hi rend="italic">The warning of general war as the primary
                            sanction against further Soviet Bloc aggression.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>e. Alternative “B” requires the U.S. to maintain for the foreseeable future
                        the military capability necessary to meet the Soviet Union in general war.
                        This is an expense that must be borne by any policy that purports to insure
                        the security of this country. Any suggestion is rejected that there is a
                        place in the atomic age for a U.S. military establishment having less
                        offensive power than that which the rulers of the Soviet Union must regard
                        as an unacceptable risk in war.</p>
                    <p>f. Alternative “B” is essentially a means for bringing the full measure of
                        U.S. power into play to deter Soviet aggression over an extended period. It
                        is proposed as a support, rather than a substitute for existing policies.
                        Within its framework, there is room for great flexibility in the conduct of
                        U.S. policy in all of its other aspects; for example, as regards treatment
                        of individual countries in Western Europe, or as regards competition between
                        Asia and Europe for U.S. attention.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Analysis of the Soviet Threat</p>
                    <p>a. The United States must accept as fact that the nations of the free world
                        are confronted with a Soviet-Communist philosophy and program of conquest
                        which, if unchecked, will result in the loss of their independence and the
                        destruction of their free institutions.</p>
                    <p>b. The U.S. policy of reacting to Soviet pressures and aggressions as they
                        have appeared at one point or another on the periphery has not been entirely
                        successful. It will be less so in the future. Overriding atomic
                        considerations confront the U.S. with two major alternatives: either a
                        preventive war while the U.S. has a wide lead in atomic weapons or the
                        adoption of a policy that will do most to insure the longest possible period
                        of peace. Preventive war is rejected. The second alternative presupposes
                        that changes within the Soviet Bloc, and in the balance of basic forces in
                        the world, can be made to serve the cause of freedom. Alternative “B” is
                        based on the latter consideration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The Line of No Aggression</p>
                    <p>a. No satisfactory close-in line was found which would include only the
                        “minimum” areas necessary to U.S. security, without consideration of present
                        obligations, sentiment or past associations. The U.S. now depends on its
                        overseas alliances for a most important, <pb xml:id="pg_414" n="414"
                            facs="0444"/>perhaps critical, part of its military capability.
                        Hypothetical gains of freedom of action would become meaningless.</p>
                    <p>b. No line was found which would exclude any large areas as not absolutely
                        vital to U.S. security, while not discarding the overseas military bases
                        which are so very important for the present, and without banding large
                        industrial resources to the Soviet Union. It is proposed that the line be
                        drawn along the borders of the present Soviet Bloc, filling the gaps in the
                        Middle East and South Asia which are not covered by current <gloss

                        clearing up final uncertainty as to U.S. intentions under these
                        alliances.</p>
                    <p>c. The “Two Worlds Concept” is rejected as undesirable and impractical.</p>
                    <p>d. The policy of Alternative “B” is, therefore, restated as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) That any advance of Soviet Bloc military forces beyond the present
                            borders of the Soviet Bloc be considered by the United States as
                            initiating general war in which the full power of the United States will
                            be used as necessary to bring about the defeat of the USSR and the
                            dissolution of the Soviet Bloc.</item>
                        <item>(2) That the United States make known publicly in an appropriate and
                            unmistakable way that it has established and is determined to carry out
                            this policy.</item>
                        <item>(3) That the United States reserve freedom of action, in the event of
                            seizure of power by indigenous Communist forces in countries beyond the
                            borders of the Soviet Bloc, to take all measures necessary to
                            re-establish a situation compatible with the security interests of the
                            United States and its allies.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Predicted Effects of the Policy</p>
                    <p>a. A clear indication that further military aggression by the Soviet Bloc
                        would result immediately in general war will reduce the likelihood that such
                        a war will occur.</p>
                    <p>b. The policy makes most effective use of U.S. power, and exploits Soviet
                        weakness.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) It will reduce the effectiveness of Communist power politics and
                            penetration in free countries. It renders subversion of a free country
                            more difficult.</item>
                        <item>(2) It will make clear that the U.S. does not hire others to fight its
                            war for it, and will provide a firmer basis for U.S. relations with
                            other free world countries.</item>
                        <item>(3) It will assist the growth of dependably anti-Communist regional
                            groupings of nations.</item>
                        <item>(4) It will on balance strengthen the United Nations.</item>
                        <item>(5) It will on balance improve the basis for resistance to Soviet
                            domination in satellite countries.</item>
                        <item>(6) It provides a safeguard against aggression by Communist China,
                            while also providing a basis for friction between the Chinese Communists
                            and the Kremlin.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_415" n="415" facs="0445"/>
                        <item>(7) Alternative “B”, although it will be most effective in maintaining
                            stable peace over a period of years, offers considerable assistance also
                            in the settlement of the current peripheral wars in Korea and
                            Indochina.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>c. The proposed policy clarifies the principal purpose of U.S. forces and
                        enables their most economical development and maintenance.</p>
                    <p>d. By clarifying the principal purpose of U.S. military forces, and the
                        circumstances in which they would be employed, the U.S. will similarly
                        clarify the size and nature of other necessary military forces around the
                        Soviet periphery.</p>
                    <p>e. The proposed policy will find the U.S. and the free world best prepared to
                        conduct a general war if it is in the Soviet scheme that there must be
                        one.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Costs</p>
                    <p>Alternative “B” will help stabilize the economy of the free world, by
                        stabilizing the cost of defense and providing a confident political
                        atmosphere for economic development. It is not contended that this
                        alternative enables free world defense expenditures in the long term to be
                        reduced from present levels, but it is contended that it will stabilize
                        defense requirements, furnish a better basis for public understanding of
                        them, and above all, provide a framework for most rewarding expenditure of
                        the money that is in fact made available.</p>
                    <p>Since Alternative “B” rules out peripheral wars, its military costs will in
                        the long term be less than the cost of any alternative that accepts such
                        wars—by the amount those wars cost. The cost of a general war is not in
                        question; all alternatives aim at preventing it.</p>
                    <p>Whatever our defense necessities, they must be met. Task Force B is in
                        agreement with A and C that the upper limit on the ability of the U.S. to
                        bear the costs of defense and of a minimum civilian economy, in case of
                        ultimate need, is not the danger of national bankruptcy, but the capacity to
                        produce gross national product. Whatever the evils of inflation, whatever
                        the economic problems involved in efforts to control it, these cannot be
                        weighed in the same scales with the great danger to our national
                        survival.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Soviet Reaction to Alternative “B” ’s Policy</p>
                    <p>a. They will most probably adopt a defensive posture.</p>
                    <p>b. Soviet economy will not adjust quickly to meet the policy, or derive any
                        particular economic advantage from it during the next decade. Economic
                        strength of the USSR will not nearly obtain parity with that of the U.S. in
                        the foreseeable future, nor will the <pb xml:id="pg_416" n="416" facs="0446"
                        />relative economic position of the USSR vis-à-vis. the-U.S. improve to a
                        degree involving an unacceptable risk to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>c. As further Soviet Bloc expansion is made more risky by a U.S. policy which
                        clearly defines the retaliatory threat of general war, Soviet leadership
                        must reckon with the latent risk of losing control over its own masses in a
                        war which would bring destruction directly upon them.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Implementation</p>
                    <p>The policy must be announced in terms which emphasize that a decisive step
                        has been taken. To have the desired effect on the rulers of the USSR, and on
                        the free world, it is essential to drive home the point that the U.S. stands
                        solidly behind its proclamation. A joint Resolution of Congress will be the
                        most powerful means of making this point. It is important to attract maximum
                        support from U.S. allies, as well as to explain and defend the policy in the
                        UN with the understanding that it is subject neither to the veto of our
                        allies or of the UN.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Mission</p>
                    <p>As directed the policy of the U.S. would be:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To increase efforts to disturb and weaken the Soviet Bloc and to
                            accelerate the consolidation and strengthening of the free world to
                            enable it to assume the greater risks involved.</item>
                        <item>b. To create the maximum disruption and popular resistance throughout
                            the Soviet Bloc.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Method of Approach</p>
                    <p>As a result of their analysis of the Soviet threat, the Task Force has
                        established the necessity of courses of action developed in three distinct
                        phases. The basic problem was to correlate the timing of actions by the
                        United States against the time when the Soviet Union will be capable of
                        dealing a destructive blow to the United States (five years). The short-term
                        period during which specific tasks are recommended is set at five years. The
                        mid-term period is set at seven years beyond the end of the short-term. For
                        this period no specific tasks, but rather general courses of action, are
                        recommended. The long-term is that period beyond the mid-term, with no set
                        terminus. No specific tasks or courses of action are recommended, but U.S.
                        ultimate objectives are summarized, which should be obtained during this
                        period.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Analysis of the Soviet Threat</p>
                    <p>The Task Force concludes from a study of the Soviet threat that time has been
                        working against us. This trend will continue unless it is arrested, and
                        reversed by positive action. . . .</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Basic U.S. Objectives</p>
                    <p>Under this policy the general peacetime objectives of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 153/1 are accepted, but the wartime objectives are added.
                        The basic purpose of national security policies remains unchanged: to
                        maintain the fundamental American values and institutions which rest on the
                        essential dignity and worth of the individual in a free society. Similarly,
                        the objectives which call for building of U.S. military and nonmilitary
                        strength, protecting a strong U.S. economy, and calling for free political
                        institutions and informed public opinion, are maintained.</p>
                    <p>Instead of preventing “significant expansion” of Soviet Bloc power (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1), the alternative is categorical as
                        to preventing <hi rend="italic">any</hi> further expansion. In reducing
                        Soviet power this alternative calls for this action “without, <hi
                            rend="italic">however, initiating</hi> general war” instead of the
                        stipulation of “without <hi rend="italic">unduly risking</hi> a general war”
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1. In adding U.S. war objectives
                        to our peace objectives, the following aims result:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Ending Soviet domination outside traditional borders.</item>
                        <item>b. Destroying the Communist apparatus in the free world.</item>
                        <item>c. Curtailing Soviet power for aggressive war.</item>
                        <item>d. Ending the Iron Curtain.</item>
                        <item>e. Cutting down the strength of any Bolshevik elements left in Soviet
                            Russia.</item>

                        does not provide for their attainment other than by recourse to general war.

                        achieve them through cold war, although admittedly running greater risk of

                        Action</p>
                    <p>a. Prosecute relentlessly a forward and aggressive political strategy in all
                        fields and by all means: military, economic, diplomatic, covert and
                        propaganda.</p>
                    <p>b. Evolve and maintain a military policy that will support the strong
                        political line until a real and permanent decision has been secured.</p>
                    <p>c. Establish, perfect and employ an executive cold war machinery that can
                        plan and execute a dynamic program of action.</p>
                    <p>d. Continue integration and build-up of all elements of anti-Soviet
                        strength.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0448"/>
                    <p>e. Exploit to the fullest, use of military forces as instruments of national
                        policy to achieve political, propaganda and prestige objectives by both
                        military and diplomatic means.</p>
                    <p>f. Utilize the technical and productive genius of the United States combined
                        with the power of our matchless industrial plant, our skilled manpower and a
                        largely self-sufficient economy.</p>
                    <p>g. Educate the public of the U.S. in the nature of our enemy, the threat to
                        our freedoms and existence and the necessity for intense and sustained
                        attack against our real political enemy, the Kremlin group.</p>
                    <p>h. Employ negotiations as a means for exploiting favorable developments and
                        improving our political position but bar those in which the United States
                        would be on the defensive or which could risk loss of certain vital elements
                        of strength and position.</p>
                    <p>i. Prosecute initially a large part of our intensified cold war covertly
                        using a national program of deception and concealment from public disclosure
                        and Soviet discernment as to the depth and extent of our challenge.</p>
                    <p>j. Miss no opportunities to confuse and unbalance our enemy nor any to
                        discredit him: within his own borders, in the eyes of our public and in
                        satellite and international circles.</p>
                    <p>k. Attain limited but definite time-phased objectives of an operational
                        nature leading progressively to more comprehensive distant objectives.</p>
                    <p>l. Limit political commitments so that the United States can retain its
                        initiative and freedom of action and exercise free world leadership.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Summary of Political, Economic and Military
                        Considerations</p>
                    <p>a. The policy is one of dynamic political warfare designed to create a
                        climate of victory which will encourage the free world and attract doubting
                        nations to our side. It exploits the principle that nothing succeeds like
                        success.</p>
                    <p>b. The free nations need early tactical victories in order to reverse the
                        trend of Communist successes.</p>
                    <p>c. The policy is a departure from our traditional concepts of war and peace.
                        It requires Congressional and popular support of the costs of building a
                        stronger military establishment than presently contemplated. It requires an
                        increased tempo of diplomatic and political activity towards the Soviet
                        Bloc.</p>
                    <p>d. The allies would be a source of strength and weakness. They would
                        undoubtedly oppose such an aggressive policy. Therefore, the full scope of
                        the plan would be revealed to them only gradually as successes were won.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_419" n="419" facs="0449"/>
                    <p>e. The United States and its allies must as a first step meet commitments

                            >NATO</gloss>. These goals must not be revised downward further.</p>
                    <p>f. The United States would overtly and covertly attack the Communist
                        apparatus on a world-wide basis. The Communist Party in the United States
                        would be outlawed.</p>
                    <p>g. Nationalism would be exploited as an effective weapon against
                        Communism.</p>
                    <p>h. In dealing with Communist forces engaged in actual hostilities, the United
                        States would not suspend the tempo of those hostilities or reduce military
                        pressure on the enemy before a settlement is actually reached.</p>
                    <p>i. The policy must never be made to appear as a policy of aggression.</p>
                    <p>j. <hi rend="italic">Germany.</hi> A united and rearmed Germany integrated in
                        the European community is sought. A lesser objective would be a neutralized
                        East Germany and a rearmed West Germany. In seeking these objectives, the
                        possibility is recognized that an agreement with the Soviet Government for
                        unification of Germany could only be obtained on condition that it would be
                        neutralized though permitted a small national defense establishment. Under
                        Alternative C the United States would be prepared to accept such a risk as
                        an interim step toward attainment of our main objective. Our minimum
                        objective, however, is a rearmed West Germany associated with the West. It
                        is recommended that we press forward toward all of these objectives until a
                        point is reached which requires that we make a final choice in the light of
                        realities of the then existing situation. The <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> nations should be informed that if they do not constitute
                        their defense community by the end of this year, the United States will
                        rearm West Germany on a bilateral basis. Concurrently, the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations will be reassured that we will
                        come to their aid if attacked by Germany.</p>

                        Propaganda and Covert Operations</p>
                    <p>a. United States propaganda and covert apparatus have failed to a certain
                        extent, largely due to two deficiencies: (1) lack of a national strategy to
                        end the cold war by winning it, and (2) lack of a national command post to
                        concentrate our political, military and economic resources on winning.
                        Adoption of the policy of Alternative C as a national strategy would solve
                        the first deficiency. The establishment of a governmental organization (such
                        as that recommended by the Jackson Committee) for implementing the strategy
                        is recommended.</p>
                    <p>b. A large-scale expansion and development of our covert apparatus is
                        urged.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Implementation</p>
                    <p>The United States Government must take the necessary steps, in terms of
                        organization and procedures, to attain the ability to effectively prosecute
                        the policy. Speed of action, continuity of policy and programs and security
                        of operations are required.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Costs</p>
                    <p>a. It is estimated that expenditures to carry out Alternative C would be of
                        the order of $60 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and 1955.
                        Expenditures decline to below $45 billion by <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1958. If fighting was resumed in Korea, the figures for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954–1955 would be between $60 billion
                        and $65 billion. These figures do not include preclusive buying, which would
                        be limited and selective. Peacetime costs would be higher in the short term
                        than under Alternatives A or B, and higher than presently proposed programs.
                        In the long term, costs should be substantially lower when we have won the
                        cold <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0453"/>war, and lower than the
                        current policy or Alternative A or B, which do not end the cold war.</p>

                    <p>f. It was not deemed feasible to specify courses of action for a period five
                        years away. At the end of the short-term period in 1958, it is believed that
                        under Alternative C, U.S. and free world strength would have greatly
                        increased. There would be no lasting peace in Korea. A severe blow to
                        Chinese prestige though the administration of a sound military defeat and
                        the destruction of some of her industrial centers would have been dealt.
                        Relations between the Soviet Union and China would have been strained, and
                        China would be beset by internal difficulties. In Europe, Germany would be
                        united and committed to neither side, though oriented toward the free world;
                        or, alternatively, she would be divided with West Germany an armed and
                        active partisan of the West. Soviet armed forces would conceivably be
                        withdrawn within the borders of the Soviet Union. The satellites would
                        experience internal deterioration.</p>
                    <p>g. In the Middle East an acceptable degree of internal stability would have
                        been attained.</p>
                    <p>h. In Africa and in Latin America improved stability and the destruction of a
                        substantial part of the Communist conspiracy would have been attained.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">18. Long-Term Guidelines</p>
                    <p>a. At the end of the mid-term or in 1965, it is envisaged that the satellites
                        will be freed, or in such a state of disaffection with the U.S.S.R. as to
                        constitute a serious weakness rather than strength in the Soviet bloc. The
                        strains between Communist China and the U.S.S.R. will have reached a point
                        where prospects are favorable for driving a final wedge between them.</p>
                    <p>b. There will be two ultimate objectives in the long term:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The reduction of Soviet power and militancy and the elimination of
                            the Communist conspiracy; and</item>
                        <item>(2) Overthrow of the Communist regime in China.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Since this phase of the conflict is in the distant future, no specific
                        courses of action are recommended. It is important to keep these objectives
                        in mind throughout all periods. No action should be undertaken that does not
                        lead ultimately to the goal of liquidation of the Communist menace.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Summary of Points Made in Discussion Following Presentation by
                        Task Forces July 16, 1953</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Task Force B.</hi> While armed, easily identifiable
                        aggression by Communist forces across the “line” drawn by the United States
                        would be grounds for general war, the United States would, in the case of
                        indigenous Communist seizure of power in a country on our side of the line,
                        retain freedom of action to restore the pre-existing situation as we saw fit
                        by using any means at our disposal.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Task Force B.</hi> The basic policy of Task Force B
                        should strongly deter the aggressive movement by Communist forces across the
                        “line” drawn by the U.S., and thereby create a stronger political and
                        psychological climate in the countries on our side of the “line”. Thus, it
                        will become easier for these countries to deal with and minimize the
                        possibility of indigenous subversion.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> Our initial position with respect to
                        the arming of Germany should leave this issue to be decided by the Germans
                        themselves, following an ultimate peace settlement. The difficulty of
                        restricting German rearmament would lie in its international regulation by a
                        body such as the UN, a body of which the Soviets are members. A very careful
                        examination should be made before being willing to accept a neutralized
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> The primary objection to implementing
                            <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> at this time is the loss of
                        negotiating position vis-à-vis the Soviets in connection with an ultimate
                        settlement of the German question. An implemented <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> would mean that the free world would be asking the Soviets
                        to withdraw their forces from East Germany, while we would be free to
                        include East Germany with West Germany in an alliance directed against the
                        Soviets. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> provides a good framework for
                        negotiation, apart from <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. If we do not
                        entwine the Germans more than necessary in <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, they and we will
                        have more flexibility in developing successful negotiating positions with
                        the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> Concurrently with attempting to
                        re-unify Germany and secure Russian withdrawal, we should proceed with the
                        unilateral rearmament of West Germany. While such unilateral rearmament
                        would weaken and strain <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, it would not
                        destroy it. There is great possibility that Germany can be brought into
                            <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> only after German unification, and
                        not before or as a condition of German unification. While the U.S. was
                        checked two and a half years ago on unilaterally rearming Germany, there
                        exists a considerably different situation today. Our allies then feared we
                        would take away equipment and supplies intended for them, and give them to
                        the Germans. We should not be restrained in our liberty of action by
                        basically unsound French fears of Germany. We recognize <pb xml:id="pg_433"
                            n="433" facs="0463"/>however that French fears and reactions must be
                        seriously considered and if possible modified, because France is an
                        indispensible part of our military geography.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> Some preference exists for a
                        unilaterally rearmed Germany as opposed to Germany as a part of <gloss
                            target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, but the decision turns upon and is related
                        to other matters. There is hope that following achievement of German
                        unification and withdrawal of Soviet forces from Germany, the Soviets might
                        withdraw their military forces from the satellites. Such a situation in turn
                        would lead to the necessity of the Soviets creating new arrangements for the
                        protection of their position and interests in the area.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> Germany is the key to developing the
                        strength of Western Europe. We cannot accept as the price for obtaining
                        French and British support against the Soviet Union suppression of Germany’s
                        natural vigor and power. We do not wish Germany again to be a menace to
                        Europe. Yet the restriction of her rearmament to certain types of
                        conventional weapons presents difficulties and is questionable. We should
                        take advantage of our very favorable position as it exists today in Germany,
                        rather than lose this opportunity because of a risk that the German menace
                        may reappear.</p>
                    <p>8. Even if the U.S. could get along economically and on the basis of
                        sufficient raw materials by concentrating its efforts on the West and
                        letting the Far and Middle East fall where it might, our allies could not
                        get along without the essential resources and dollar earnings of those
                        areas. There would result a deterioration of the allies’ political and
                        economic position and their will to resist, which in turn would affect the
                        U.S. From the military point of view, such a course of action would lead to
                        a danger so great to the U.S. as to necessitate spending much more than we
                        are today for defense. For example, if the power complex of Japan were added
                        to the Soviet Union’s capability, the resultant increase in Soviet strength
                        would be a great danger to the U.S. The union of Japan, China, and Manchuria
                        in a communist system would be incalculably dangerous. Furthermore, it would
                        create a climate of defeat through the free world.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Task Force C.</hi> Rather than taking fewer actions
                        stretching out over a longer period of time in order to involve less dollar
                        costs, Task Force C believes its program might be strung out over too long a
                        period.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Task Force C.</hi> Task Force C feels that the
                        guarantee to France against German aggression should be restated and
                        reaffirmed.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Task Force C.</hi> The matter of the ratification of
                            <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> has been left too much in the hands
                        of the French Government. The U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_434" n="434" facs="0464"
                        />should pick up the ball and pressure for a decision by France. Of course
                        it is not possible to foretell whether the French will react logically to
                        such pressure in terms of what we would consider logical.</p>
                    <p>12. The essential differences of approach between Task Forces A and C cannot
                        be reconciled. There are also differences between Task Forces A and B. The
                        latter Task Force believes the Soviet will be a tougher aggressive menace
                        than A envisages. Task Force A thinks mainly in terms of aggression by
                        Russian forces, while Task Force B treats the Soviet bloc as a whole.</p>
                    <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Task Force B.</hi> Peripheral wars are uneconomical and
                        weakening. UN and regional agreements do not sufficiently guarantee against
                        peripheral wars. The strength of the position of Task Force B lies in its
                        reliance on the threat of general war as a final sanction. However, if it
                        were clear that the UN and regional agreements went beyond local and
                        peripheral defense arrangements and envisaged direct retaliation against the
                        Soviet Union, they might provide as effective mechanisms as unilateral
                        action.</p>
                    <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Task Force C.</hi> The U.S. cannot continue to live
                        with the Soviet threat. So long as the Soviet Union exists, it will not fall
                        apart, but must and can be shaken apart.</p>
                    <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Task Force A.</hi> We must try to weaken Soviet power
                        and bring about its withdrawal within traditional Russian boundaries, then,
                        rather than press for the destruction of the Soviet state, we should wait
                        for an evolution in Soviet life and patterns of behavior which might follow
                        from such a withdrawal. There is possibility that the Soviet Union will
                        change. There are signs of evolution, particularly in recent events.
                        Accordingly, one fears the aggressive thesis of Task Force C, and must ask:
                        if we won a war, what would we put in the place of the Soviet Government?
                        There do not exist among Russian people at this time elements from which
                        could be formed a democratic government. While Task Force B feels that it is
                        necessary to create a further deterrent to general war and Soviet aggression
                        in order to bring about an evolution in Soviet behavior, Task Force A feels
                        that sufficient deterrents already exist and are capable of being shaped
                        into a better form.</p></frus:attachment>

                        by noting that the Solarium reports had been distributed to Council members

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> informed the
                        Council that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was preparing a coordinated
                        estimate as to whether time was on our side.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">The
                            estimate under reference cannot be identified with precision because
                            several papers were being prepared at this time on the general topic of
                            Soviet capabilities. Presumably the reference estimate was either <gloss
                                target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>–90, “Soviet Bloc Capabilities Through
                            Mid-1955” of Aug. 18, 1953, or, more likely, <gloss target="#t_SE1"
                                >SE</gloss>–36/1, “Soviet Capabilities for an Attack on the US
                            Before Mid-1955” of Aug. 3, 1953. For documentation on Soviet
                            capabilities, including relevant <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>s
                            and <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>s, see <ref target="frus1952-54v08"
                                >volume VIII</ref>.</note> He summarized several of the conclusions
                        of this forthcoming estimate as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) If the USSR continues its present policies it will close the
                            economic gap now existing between it and the United States. From this
                            point of view, time is on the side of the USSR.</item>
                        <item>(2) The U.S. and the USSR will each acquire weapons capable of
                            crippling the other. Hence the U.S. is losing its invulnerability to
                            direct attack.</item>
                        <item>(3) As Western defense capabilities in overseas areas near the Soviet
                            Union increase, the relative position of the U.S. is improved, and from
                            this point of view time is on the side of the U.S.</item>
                        <item>(4) While no collapse within the Soviet bloc can be foreseen, the USSR
                            may lack vitality over the long run. From this point of view time may be
                            on the side of the U.S., but this factor will not show up critically for
                            10 or 15 years yet.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, referring to
                        the proposed new basic concept on the second page of the paper distributed
                        by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, felt that further
                        study was required on such an obviously complicated subject. He also felt
                        that it would be premature at this time to concentrate on a grouping of
                        nations centered on Japan in the Far East. For some time yet we must deal
                        individually with Far Eastern countries and not alienate them by pushing
                        Japan out in front. He added that of course Japan eventually would become
                        the power center of the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The President thought it would be desirable to study the proposed new basic
                        concept very seriously. He asked, however, whether the lack of any mention
                        of Greece or Turkey in the proposed new basic concept meant that we were
                        deserting those countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> also expressed
                        anxiety at the omission of the Near East from the paper. He felt that we
                        must not neglect the Near East and the Middle East in our assistance
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked
                        whether the first paragraph of the proposed new basic concept meant a big
                        build-up of U.S. military force. He felt that we should consider less
                        expensive means of carrying out our policy. He agreed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> that we could not neglect the
                        Near East. Aside from these remarks, he felt that the new basic concept was
                        a good general approach. He added, however, with reference to paragraph 3 of
                        the paper, that he felt U.S. assistance <pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437"
                            facs="0467"/>to other countries should be on the decline in the near
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The President said that our aid to Europe would be on the decline if we could
                        get Europe to go in for political and economic union. If Europe would do
                        what it should do, conceivably it could by itself defeat Russia. This would
                        not be the case, however, in other areas of the world which could not be
                        built up as military centers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that if it
                        should become possible to decrease aid to Europe, the expenditures thus
                        saved should be used in the Middle East and in Latin America, where U.S.
                        access to the sources of raw materials was very important.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BRADLEYGAON1">Bradley</persName> felt that the
                        Planning Board committee which would work on Project Solarium should not be
                        given too much guidance. The committee would need to approach the question
                        with an open mind and devote careful thought to it.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that this was something that could not be done in a big
                            area.<note n="5" xml:id="d80fn5">A handwritten notation on the source
                            text at this point reads: “arena?”.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> reverted to
                        paragraph 1 of the proposed new basic concept, and asked whether there
                        couldn’t be less rather than more military build-up.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it was part of our policy to build up our capability
                        for action. He agreed that whoever worked on this project in the future
                        should have the broadest possible directive.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> noted that the
                        new Joint Chiefs of Staff should have an opportunity to comment. He was
                        assured by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> that this
                        would be the procedure.</p>
                    <p>On the question of timing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said that this project would have a profound effect
                        on the next budget. If a new line of policy should be decided upon, the
                        plans and the costs must be known soon.</p>
                    <p>The President said that probably all military aid should be put in the
                        Defense budget. Under this concept, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> would be an executive agent for both State and
                        Defense. The President said it had a fatal effect on Congress to call a bill
                        a foreign aid bill. Even a member of the Administration, i.e., the Secretary
                        of the Treasury, calls aid bills “give-away bills”. The President felt that
                        if military assistance were put in the context of the Defense budget it
                        would sell itself.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed that
                        the military budget should be confined to military expenditures and should
                        include all military items.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_438" n="438" facs="0468"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said he was
                        prepared to agree to the proposed new basic concept for the time being if it
                        didn’t settle anything.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed with those who thought the paper did not sufficiently
                        emphasize the Middle East. He said there was no better nation in the whole
                        world to have on our side than Turkey. The President also felt that the
                        language of the proposed new basic concept did not give guidelines for
                        subsequent work on Project Solarium, but rather tended to direct and form
                        the policy. The President asked whether the word “limited” could not be
                        deleted from paragraph 3, since he didn’t know what “limited” meant in that
                        context.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General said he hated to let paragraph 4 of the proposed new
                        basic concept go by. He thought we should say that we would decide the areas
                        in which an advance by the Soviets beyond present borders would be
                        considered a <hi rend="italic">casus belli.</hi> He felt, however, that we
                        could not draw a line and announce it to the world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        the Council was not agreeing with this paper as policy, but as guidance to a
                        Planning Board committee.</p>
                    <p>The President said that was indeed the case. He suggested the following
                        sentence might be put at the top of the page: “This is a staff exploration
                        based on the following assumptions:”. In effect we were setting up Task
                        Force D, which would prepare a report on the basis of the work of Task
                        Forces A, B and C. He suggested that the Planning Board should start work on
                        the project on the basis of guidelines revised in the light of the
                        discussion at the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C. D. Jackson</persName> then noted
                        that the Solarium studies contained many bits and pieces of desirable
                        actions which should not wait for the preparation of a complete new policy
                        paper. The preliminary steps toward taking some of these actions would cost
                        nothing. For example, the Department of State could investigate the
                        diplomatic possibilities of detaching Satellite X without waiting for the
                        adoption of a new policy.</p>
                    <p>The President wondered whether a permanent evaluation committee, that is a
                        continuous small staff, might be needed to keep going over the Solarium
                        proposals and recommending those that might be implemented. The President
                        added that if we need to do something, let’s do it now; if something should
                        be done, even 24 hours delay is too much.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> asked whether the
                        situation in Guatemala was the kind of thing Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> had in mind.</p>
                    <p>This prompted the Vice President to inquire whether the proposed new basic
                        concept covered such situations as that existing in <pb xml:id="pg_439"
                            n="439" facs="0469"/>Guatemala, where the Communists took subversive
                        action and we had to take some kind of action as a counter measure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said one part of our
                        concept should be to reduce indigenous Communist power outside the Soviet
                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> agreed with this,
                        and suggested that the Planning Board scrutinize the Solarium studies and
                        extract any items on which action should be taken at once, and make
                        appropriate recommendation to the Council. He added that sometimes every
                        agency in Washington waited for some other agency to take an action which
                        should be taken.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that the
                        present U.S. action in Guatemala was blocked by the reluctance of other
                        countries in the area to go along with us: Consequently, new policy
                        decisions were needed. He said that a paper on Albania had already been sent
                        to <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in
                        case any action were taken with respect to Albania, it should be in the
                        hands of a task force headed by one competent individual.</p>
                    <p>The President said Albania was a very difficult case because of the question
                        of who gets it and who gets hurt.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said a start
                        could be made on a more positive policy in Albania without the risk of war.
                        Such was not the case in Hainan, which could be taken only by overt military
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said he would
                        like a special study group on Iranian oil. Defense was very unhappy about
                        the situation in Iran. The suits against the oil companies were damaging us
                        seriously in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>The President said that studies had been going on for the last five or six
                        years. He had seen all kinds of estimates, and there must be many that he
                        had not seen. He suggested that an inventory might be made in the various
                        departments of studies on the Middle East. The Council might be given a list
                        of these studies and told what they are about, particularly if they contain
                        proposed solutions to our problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that Iran would
                        soon bring up some very tough policy decisions. The basic decision was how
                        to keep the Iranian economy afloat without a deal with the British.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        everyone had been working on the Middle East oil problem for some time. The
                        British had been adamant because of the possible effects on British
                        world-wide prestige. There was no easy way for the U.S. to get around
                            <persName corresp="#p_CHURCHILLWS1">Churchill</persName> and avoid
                        worsening our relations with the British.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the British view was that it would be better to lose
                        the oil, even to the Soviets, than to surrender to Mossadegh.</p>

                    <p>1. On the initiative of the President and under the general direction of the

                        <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, a project was undertaken
                        to reassess our basic national strategy in the face of the Soviet threat.
                        The project was given the name of “Solarium”.</p>
                    <p>2. As a means of defining the alternatives and presenting the problem clearly
                        for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration, it was decided to lay
                        out three separate lines of national strategy and to call together a group
                        of official and unofficial individuals to work as separate Task Forces in
                        exploring and defending the three main alternative strategies. Each Task
                        Force was made up of seven members, five specially chosen and two members of
                        the current graduating class of the National War College.</p>
                    <p>3. The three Task Forces undertook respectively to defend the following three
                        national strategies:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Present policy as set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                        <item>b. The drawing of a line beyond which the United States would not
                            permit Soviet or satellite military forces to move without provoking
                            general war;</item>
                        <item>c. A more dynamic and aggressive strategy aimed at creating a climate

                    </p>
                    <p>When he had finished reading the report, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that it had been
                        drafted by its four authors before they had taken office and prior to any
                        staff discussion, in the interests of preserving secrecy. Accordingly, the
                        document represented the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before they had
                        had an opportunity to become acquainted in detail with existing plans and
                        programs. In sum, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> stated that this report represented the view of the
                        four individuals who had written it regarding the problems we faced
                        today.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired whether the military program set forth in this
                        report would not cost more than the current program.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that,
                        on the contrary, it would ultimately cost less. It would, he pointed out,
                        take time and money to make the redeployments and alter the commitments
                        contemplated in the report, but once these changes had been made it would be
                        possible to effect substantial savings.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then inquired whether the report still contemplated the
                        maintenance of United States bases overseas.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> answered “yes”.
                        While the report certainly contemplated bringing back U.S. personnel in
                        large numbers, we proposed to keep our bases and to try to get indigenous
                        personnel to <pb xml:id="pg_445" n="445" facs="0475"/>take over certain
                        tasks in overseas bases now being performed by U.S. military personnel.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then asked whether the report contemplated a complete
                        change of United States foreign policy with respect to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that it
                        certainly contemplated a review of our commitments to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> observed that he
                        had hitherto assumed that, in the main, the purpose of our military bases on
                        foreign soil was to deter global war or, if it occurred, to win the war. To
                        him this involved the maintenance of bases around the perimeter of the USSR.
                        “Am I correct”, asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, “in assuming that most of these bases would be
                        maintained in terms of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>’s report?”</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>’ assumption was
                        correct. We would certainly continue to deploy naval and air forces abroad;
                        though in the case of Air, at least, such forces would be rotated. All the
                        bases would be maintained in a state of effective readiness even if U.S.
                        personnel might not be fully deployed in each base all the time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that the
                        Joint Chiefs would certainly wish the United States to carry out a foreign
                        policy designed to preserve these overseas bases.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative, and then asked if any of the other Chiefs wished to
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> stated that the
                        members of the Council should bear in mind that certain conditions had been
                        imposed on the Chiefs in the preparation of this study, particularly
                        budgetary limitations. As a result, the authors of the report could discern
                        only one course of action which would concurrently safeguard the national
                        security and meet the budgetary limitation. So serious were the implications
                        of the course of action selected that the views expressed in the report
                        might, upon closer examination, prove unacceptable. Nevertheless, continued
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>, we look on the
                        present proposal as a modification rather than as a reversal of existing
                        basic security policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> observed that
                        the heaviest impact of the course of action recommended by the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff would be the reduction of United States land forces in Central
                        Europe, Japan, and Korea. This would mean, he presumed, greater dependence,
                        for preserving the security of these areas, on the deterrent force
                        represented by air power and atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> replied that he
                        was unable to give a categorical answer on this point. Air and naval forces
                        alone, he believed, could never constitute an effective deterrent to enemy
                        ground attack. <pb xml:id="pg_446" n="446" facs="0476"/>Certainly, continued
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>, this report
                        would involve a most careful examination of the question whether we want to
                        try to fight a war on the overseas periphery—as remote as possible from the
                        continental U.S.—or, on the contrary, greatly reduce this peripheral
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> then called
                        attention to the fact that available trained reserves of military manpower
                        were almost used up. Quite apart from the budgetary considerations, this
                        fact had weighed heavily in the conclusions reached in the report. Our
                        allies, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>,
                        must be induced to supply more men for the task of common defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> answered that he
                        had said just this, and in very vigorous language, to the Prime Minister of
                        Japan recently.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">For additional information on the
                            Secretary’s conversation with Prime Minister Yoshida, see telegram 13
                            from Tokyo, Aug. 7, 1953, scheduled for publication in <ref
                                target="frus1952-54v14p1">volume XIV</ref>.</note> He had urged the
                        necessity for larger Japanese forces to provide the initial defense of Japan
                        against Communist attack. Another factor which seemed to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> of great importance, was that
                        dependence on mobile U.S. forces would largely obviate the very difficult
                        public relations problem invariably occasioned when large U.S. forces were
                        stationed in foreign countries. It was not, therefore, wholly a question
                        “whether you’ve got the men to put there and the money to keep them there”,
                        but the international friction which the presence of these forces produced
                        nearly everywhere. In general, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, he found himself very
                        sympathetic to the report’s approach, but he was worried as to how the
                        redeployment of U.S. forces could be carried out without causing foreign
                        governments and peoples to conclude that the U.S. thought the menace of the
                        USSR and of global war had diminished or vanished. There would be very great
                        danger if we withdrew completely from Europe or from other areas where our
                        security dictated that we maintain some troops. This was all the more true
                        since the governments of many friendly nations were at the moment themselves
                        tending to lower their defense sights. Moreover, most such governments
                        simply could not afford to increase their defense contributions to a point
                        which would take up the slack after our withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that
                        the Chiefs had had no illusions as to the difficulty of the course they had
                        chosen. It was necessary, however, to consider the counterweights to the
                        withdrawal and redeployment of American forces. In the first place, Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> argued that it is
                        generally realized by all friendly foreign nations that a strong United
                        States is <pb xml:id="pg_447" n="447" facs="0477"/>the greatest deterrent to
                        the launching of global war by the Soviet Union. Secondly, the report had
                        stressed the necessity for spelling out clearly, to our friends and to the
                        enemy, our national objectives and policies. This would involve clearly
                        stating that we are concentrating our great strength and not merely
                        abandoning our allies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, who had
                        thus far remained silent, stated that the report was “terrific”. He could
                        not be more impressed. This was the most important thing that had happened
                        in this country since January 20.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> agreed that the
                        Joint Chiefs’ report was an historic event.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> then stated
                        that he wished to make a few comments on what seemed to him a very profound
                        question and problem. He said that he desired to emphasize in the first
                        place that the present report did not constitute the corporate view of the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff, but rather the view of the individual Chiefs prior to
                        their taking office. It was as dangerous to construe this report, on the one
                        hand, as a withdrawal of American power into the Western Hemisphere as, on
                        the other, for the U.S. to embark on preventive war. Certainly, said General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, he desired to
                        make it crystal clear that he did not subscribe to the withdrawal of our
                        forces stationed overseas. After all, the present report merely recommended
                        a careful examination of the concept it set forth.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>
                        insisted that he would not possibly subscribe to any theory that you could
                        prevent war through the deterrent effect of any single military arm.
                        Thirdly, implementation of the concept in this report would have to be most
                        carefully phased and timed. Securing adequate protection of the vitals of
                        the American continent did not mean that you abandoned Europe, though
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> said he was
                        personally ready to admit that the United States could not, at one and the
                        same time, assure adequate defense of the continental United States and an
                        adequate defense posture overseas.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then inquired whether he was correct in assuming from this
                        report that in the event of a major conflict the United States would use
                        atomic weapons both in the tactical and in the strategic realm.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        this was indeed the case, and that it would require public announcement
                        regarding the use of atomic weapons. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> went on to say that, as he
                        saw it, we had been spending vast sums on the manufacture of these weapons
                        and at the same time we were holding back on their use because of our
                        concern for public opinion. It was high time that we clarified our position
                        on the use of such weapons if indeed we proposed to use them.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_448" n="448" facs="0478"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> then asked Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> if it had occurred
                        to the authors of the report that even a slow and partial redeployment of
                        U.S. forces back to this country would be interpreted widely abroad as a
                        withdrawal to Fortress America.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        this point had been prominent in the thinking of the Chiefs, but went on to
                        say that it had seemed to him quite possible that the continuation of our
                        present deployment presented problems almost as difficult. We could not, for
                        example, hope to station troops forever in Japan. There was also the
                        friction which the presence of such forces engendered. So you had to balance
                        one evil against another.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> commented that we
                        must make our position clear before we proceeded to carry out our plans, if
                        the worst effects of executing this policy were to be avoided.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed
                        agreement with this point, and noted the very strong sentiment in Congress
                        for just such a move as seemed to be contemplated in this report. It would
                        be easy for the Congress to misunderstand seriously the intent and extent of
                        the redeployment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> remarked that he had
                        been very much impressed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>’s comments on the manpower problem as it affected
                        the armed forces, and asked whether Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> would not expand on this
                        subject now. If the draft law expires next year, for example, how would we
                        get the men necessary to do the job?</p>
                    <p>Before Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> could
                        reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said he felt impelled to
                        point out the very heavy responsibility that we all have to see to it that
                        our American men and women in the armed forces were properly paid and
                        pensioned. These men and women were, after all, the heart of our defense.
                        They were not being adequately rewarded now, and our Congress and Government
                        should feel obliged to recognize the need for proper compensation to these
                        splendid men and women.</p>
                    <p>It then became the turn of General <persName corresp="#p_TWININGGNF1"
                            >Twining</persName> to comment on the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> report. He said he wished to concur in everything that
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> had stated. He
                        added that each of the four authors of the report had in the first instance
                        prepared a statement of his own views and had presented these views
                        unilaterally. Nevertheless, all four papers closely resembled each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> then inquired
                        whether the authors of the report would have had different views if the
                        budget problem had not been introduced. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TWININGGNF1">Twining</persName> replied “no”.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President observed that money was obviously a consideration. But, he
                        inquired, even if we had had the required money, <pb xml:id="pg_449" n="449"
                            facs="0479"/>would we have preferred to continue the policy and program
                        which was currently in effect?</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        this had been Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>’s
                        position, but not that of the others.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then asked if it was the unanimous opinion of the four
                        Chiefs that the United States was now over-extended. All four answered in
                        the affirmative. In that case, said the Vice President, we would be obliged
                        to redeploy our forces even if it were to prove possible to find the money
                        to support the present deployment of our forces overseas.</p>
                    <p>Agreeing with the Vice President, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> expressed the strong personal opinion that there
                        were other factors than money alone which clearly dictated a redeployment.
                        For one thing, it would be impossible for the United States to maintain
                        armed forces of the present size and composition on any voluntary basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that this was
                        a problem which <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> had been intensively
                        studying. He was therefore much interested in the statement in the report
                        that any significant augmentation of our armed forces would compel us to go
                        to full mobilization.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that
                        not only would it be necessary to go to full mobilization because of
                        manpower shortages, but it would also be necessary to resort to a controlled
                        economy, since we were taking all that we could take out of our economy
                        short of such controls.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that as he understood the present report, the Chiefs
                        of Staff had first studied the enemy’s capabilities and intentions and had
                        concluded that plans and programs which had been made in 1950 would
                        inevitably be different from the plans that we would make at present. In
                        1950, the primary danger posed by the Soviets was an attack on the ground
                        against Europe. At that time, moreover, we had, of course, tremendous atomic
                        superiority over the Soviet Union. Now, however, or thinking in terms of,
                        say, 1955, the enemy himself will have large atomic resources in addition to
                        extensive ground forces. Would it be true, inquired the Vice President, that
                        to the extent that the enemy has acquired sufficient atomic capability to
                        launch a devastating attack on the United States, the problem of coping with
                        this attack becomes more prominent, while the problem of coping with a
                        conventional attack recedes?</p>
                    <p>In reply, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        stated that after the outbreak of the Korean war in June 1950, we really did
                        not know the enemy’s ultimate intentions, so all we could do was to build up
                        our forces in all categories. This was sound. We commenced to build up our
                        military establishment so that it could be ready for a full-scale war effort
                        at a certain date. No military man, continued Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, could <pb xml:id="pg_450"
                            n="450" facs="0480"/>conceivably disagree that we must continue to keep
                        our armed forces built up. The atomic factor, however, now looms much
                        larger, and the problem of continental defense is now much more important
                        than it seemed in the summer of 1950.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then inquired
                        why the general program set forth in the JSC report would cost less. Does
                        it, for example, cost less to maintain troops at home than abroad?</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> answered that
                        it would cost less to maintain these forces in the United States, but, quite
                        apart from this factor, one could anticipate a much higher enlistment rate
                        in our armed forces if our soldiers and sailors did not have to contemplate
                        the separation from their families which resulted from deployment overseas.
                        Still other benefits would accrue to our training program and the use of our
                        pool of specialists.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                        took it that the present report had not gone into the question of the costs
                        of our military assistance program. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that it had not done
                        so in detail, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> went on to inquire what would happen to this program
                        now. There could be no denying that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is
                        sick at the present time. There was great uncertainty and dissension among
                        the member nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> planned to have a preliminary meeting about the first
                        of October with the Foreign Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> states. This would be devoted largely to generalities as
                        to the political situation, since the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        powers were not as yet ready to talk about force goals for the next year.
                        The latter subject would come up at a full <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> meeting in December. In any case, continued Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, in order to keep the
                        spark of life alive in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> body, it
                        would be necessary to have this October meeting. Accordingly, it was
                        absolutely vital to make up our own minds as to our program and policy
                        before these <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings, and
                        particularly prior to the December meeting. The time was all too short to
                        educate and lead public opinion in the desired direction.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> responded to
                        this statement by pointing out that we could not go on as we have been going
                        another year. What with the hydrogen bomb, people are demanding a genuine
                        reappraisal of our national security position. The stage was now all set. If
                        we did not walk out onto the stage, the results would be terrible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                        while this might be true, the change of policy proposed in the <gloss

                        we were not allowed sufficient time to prepare public opinion abroad for
                        this change. Domestic opinion would, of course, be delighted with this new
                        concept. The difficulties would come overseas.</p>

                    <p>From the standpoint of proper implementation, inquired the Vice President,
                        would it not be desirable to relate the Joint Chiefs’ report to the Solarium
                        study?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> recommended
                        that the Solarium study be suspended, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that the study would be
                        very useful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> commented that it
                        seemed to him that the Council had reacted very favorably to the report by
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He then suggested that he should report this
                        reaction to the President and inquire whether the President wanted (1) the
                        Joint Chiefs to review the military program in detail and make specific
                        recommendations for carrying out the concept of their report; (2) to inform
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board to take the views of
                        the Joint Chiefs into account in their preparation of a new basic policy;
                        and (3) to ask the Psychological Strategy Board to develop the best possible
                        program to handle the psychological problems with our allies that the
                        adoption of the Joint Chiefs’ concept would pose.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> thought Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s proposal rather too
                        involved. It seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> that the next important step was for the State
                        Department to explore carefully and to digest the implications of adopting
                        the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concept. On the military side there
                        seemed little more to do.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed his
                        emphatic agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> that for the present no more study was needed by
                        the Pentagon. What was required was a decision by the National Security
                        Council as to the validity of the general concept advanced by the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> report. Accordingly, the first thing was to
                        provide the President with an expression of opinion by the members of the
                        National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, on the other hand,
                        said that he felt it undesirable for the Council to offer the President any
                        final opinion on this report until the State Department and the <gloss
                            target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> had had an opportunity to study the report
                        from the foreign policy and psychological viewpoints, and give their views
                        to the Council.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the President would probably want the State Department to
                        explore the whole matter. The problem was extremely delicate, and its
                        solution would require time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked whether the
                        Council should leave the report substantially in the hands of the Secretary
                        of State to head up the process of exploring whether and how its concept
                        could be carried into effect.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> concurred in
                        this suggestion, and pointed out that after the State Department had reached
                        an opinion on the <pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0482"/>report, he would
                        certainly want the Psychological Strategy Board to study the public
                        relations aspects.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        his conviction that at present the United States lacked an adequate defense
                        for its own vitals. Obviously, such defense must be provided, and quickly.
                        This could be done in one of two ways: We can either do everything that we
                        are doing now in providing for our national security, and add continental
                        defense to the total; or else we can follow the view expressed in the
                        present report, cut down on what we are doing elsewhere, and jack up our
                        continental defense. It was up to the Secretary of State, continued
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, to answer
                        the significant question whether the course of action suggested by the Joint
                        Chiefs’ report was a wise course of action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that while he
                        agreed that much more attention must in the future be paid to the defense of
                        the continental United States, he was not willing to commit himself in favor
                        of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> report until the Secretary of
                        State had studied all its foreign policy implications.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then informed
                        the Council that in his recent speech to the American Bar Association in
                            Boston<note n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>’ address before the
                            American Bar Association at Boston on Aug. 26, 1953 entitled “The U.S.
                            Constitution and the U.N. Charter—An Appraisal,” is printed in
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> Sept. 7, 1953, pp.
                            307–310.</note> he had urged that no single country, not even the United
                        States, could, out of its own resources, adequately match the strength of a
                        powerful totalitarian state. We were in no position to extract from our
                        people what tyrannical rulers could extract from their people. The attempt
                        to do so would “bust us”. Accordingly, the only way the free world could
                        hope to maintain sufficient strength so that each of its members did not “go
                        broke”, was the pooling of resources. The combined resources of the nations
                        of the free world, if effectively employed, could be enough to offset the
                        Soviet bloc. Therefore, to take any measures which destroyed the unity of
                        the free world, or shifted the defense burden to the United States alone,
                        would not be a real economy in the long run. The “art of the thing” is to
                        reshape our policy and program in such fashion that we can still maintain
                        enough free world cohesion to provide for a common pooling of resources.
                        Isolation, warned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, would cost the United States dearly in the long run.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> prophesied that
                        this reshaping could probably be accomplished, but he pointed out that the
                        whole free world was in the grip of nervous tension and greatly feared a
                        revival of the Fortress America concept. We must handle ourselves carefully,
                        therefore, if we would avoid disaster.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_453" n="453" facs="0483"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said that he thought
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> had
                        specifically warned against any reversion to the idea of Fortress America.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        he had warned against such a course, and that the Chiefs had all appreciated
                        the seriousness of the problems which Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> had raised. He wondered,
                        however, if there was not another aspect of maintaining large American
                        forces overseas which was far from favorable. Would not such a course lead
                        many of the nervous governments and peoples of Europe to continue to think
                        that the United States was actively seeking war? The redeployment proposed
                        in the present report might, if carried out, go far to spike the argument
                        that this nation sought war. Admittedly, however, the problem of clarifying
                        our intentions overseas was crucial.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated
                        succinctly that the next move was the Secretary of State’s.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President observed that he assumed that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> concept was still a concept of standing up to the USSR and
                        not knuckling down to it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State then drew an analogy between the maintenance of troops
                        in various states of the United States and the concept of deployment
                        contained in the present report. He argued that the citizens of New York,
                        Texas, or Massachusetts, did not consider themselves vulnerable to attack
                        and invasion because our troops were quartered in Louisiana, Illinois, or
                        some other state. We knew we were safe because, while our troops were
                        concentrated, they could quickly be dispatched to the danger zone. What was
                        necessary was to gain acceptance for this kind of concentration among the
                        peoples of the free world. If we do not succeed in selling this
                        interpretation of the proposed redeployment, we can anticipate that the
                        governments and peoples of the free world will dismiss our proposed new
                        policy as simply camouflaged isolation.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President pointed out that the idea of Fortress America had
                        originally arisen during the great debate on foreign policy prior to
                        American entry into the second World War. At that time it meant to its
                        exponents that America could be defended, but Europe could not. We now
                        believe, however, that we can defend all vital parts of the free world by
                        applying the principle of concentration of forces. This, insisted the Vice
                        President, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Fortress America of the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, discussion centered on the nature of Council action on the report
                        and on the relation between this report and the Solarium study. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that this
                        relationship would have to be worked out, and meanwhile every effort must be
                        made to prevent leaks as to the content of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> report.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_454" n="454" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>On the latter point, General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> asked permission to repeat his belief that if <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> got any inkling of the content of this
                        new concept, rightly or wrongly, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        powers would almost certainly construe it as an abandonment, and the
                        consequences would be terrifying.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> expressed a
                        different view. He said that the United States had always considered that it
                        would withdraw its own contribution to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces at such time as the European states had achieved
                        the capacity to defend themselves. In the parts of Europe, he went on, with
                        which he was well acquainted, the authorities were not seeking the presence
                        of our forces, but rather assistance in building their own. For this reason,
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> was convinced
                        that the concept of redeployment could be sold without the consequences
                        which some members of the Council feared.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, agreeing with
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>, pointed out
                        that we might well be obliged to redeploy our divisions in Germany whether
                        we adopted the concept in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> report or
                        not. If the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> failed of ratification and
                        it was decided that Germany should be neutralized, we would be obliged to
                        withdraw U.S. forces from Germany, and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said he could think of
                        nowhere else in Europe where they could be sent. Apart from the faint
                        possibility that some of these forces could be sent to French Morocco,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> agreed that
                        there was no place in Europe to which these troops could be sent.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> again warmly praised the
                        work of the Joint Chiefs. He appeared to speak in this respect for all the
                        Council members, to a greater or lesser degree.</p>

                    <p>On September 2, President <persName corresp="#p_EISENHOWERGADD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> issued Executive Order No. 10483 (18 Federal
                        Register 5379) establishing the Operations Coordinating Board. This action
                        was based upon recommendations contained in the report submitted to the
                        President on June 30, 1953 by <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONWH1">William
                            Jackson</persName>, head of the President’s Committee on International

                            <persName>Jackson</persName> Report, see pages 1795 ff.</p>
                    <p>According to the President’s Executive order, the objectives of the
                        Operations Coordinating Board, “which shall report to the National Security
                        Council,” were to provide for the integrated implementation of national
                        security policies by the several agencies concerned. The Board was composed
                        of the Under Secretary of State (chairman), the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
                        the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration, the Director of
                        Central Intelligence, and a representative of the President. <persName

                    <p>1. While briefing the President yesterday in Denver about the Council meeting
                        on August 27: (a) the President read again the report signed by the four new
                        Joint Chiefs; (b) he then read my memo of 1 Sept. 53, entitled “August 27/53

                    <p>2. The President was much interested. In approving the Council Action,
                        reading—“agreed to recommend to the President that the Secretary of State be
                        authorized to explore from the point of view of foreign policy the
                        possibility of adopting the concept set forth in this report,” He added, for
                        the final version of the record of action the following words of his own:
                        “This concept is a crystallized and clarified statement of this
                        Administration’s understanding of our national security objectives since
                        World War II.” He reiterated several times that the concept was not new;
                        must and could not properly be thought of or mentioned as new.</p>
                    <p>Then he had me write down the following as he walked up and down the
                        room:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“From the beginning, people who really studied foreign and military
                            problems have considered that the stationing of American troops abroad
                            was a temporary expedient.</item>
                        <item>“It was a stop-gap operation to bring confidence and security to our
                            friends overseas, who were desperately exposed to Communist
                            aggression.</item>
                        <item>“Any thinking individual, in the services or out, always understood
                            that the basic purpose of so stationing American troops was to produce
                            among our friends morale, confidence, economic and military strength, in
                            order that they would be able to hold vital areas with indigenous troops
                            until American help could arrive.</item>
                        <item>“This idea from the beginning placed a premium on <list>
                                <item>(1) safety of the US from surprise and destructive
                                    attack,</item>
                                <item>(2) existence of highly mobile forces,</item>
                                <item>(3) comprehensive mobilization plans quickly to marshal our
                                    entire strength in support of our national security (ourselves
                                    and our friends).”</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Then he went on that I was to add to the foregoing that this idea of the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> must never be presented as a “new
                        concept”—that it was a “reaffirmation and clarification of what he had
                        always understood.”</p>
                    <p>3. I told him that you had similarly spoken to me on Tuesday night. When I
                        told him the further views you had expressed at that meeting of the only way
                        you now saw to work the matter out, he was extremely interested and reacted
                        favorably. He said that, of course, our friends would have to understand our
                        basic thinking at some time. He took to the dramatic idea which you stated
                        and the reason you expressed for mentioning extreme secrecy.</p>
                    <p>4. In answer to a question, I said that I did not understand that you
                        proposed <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to hold diplomatic conversations with
                        our allies <pb xml:id="pg_457" n="457" facs="0487"/>about the matter, but
                        only to explore ways and means with your own associates.</p>
                    <p>5. He said he would be interested to see you any time you would come out to
                        Denver. Simply call up Tom Stephens and make a convenient time (Tom will be
                        expecting a call). The President expects to be in Denver constantly until he
                        comes East about the 17th or 18th. The sooner you see him, the better.</p>
                    <p>6. After he approved the Record of Action of the Council Meeting as
                        above-noted, he indicated in reply to a question that he thought this return
                        to our original thinking could and should be included in the Solarium Policy
                        Paper, kept appropriately quiet and without attribution.</p>
                    <p>7. The new H-bomb development, which we discussed,<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2"

                        about how much we should poke at the animal through the bars of the
                        cage.</p>

                    <p>Against the above background, the Soviet “peace offensive” invites wishful
                        thinking, on the part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners and
                        Japan, that the danger is past and that neutralism and military economy are

                    <p rend="center">VI.</p>
                    <p>A U.S. shift of emphasis, reflected by new military dispositions and changed
                        budgetary approaches in favor of increased continental defense and greater
                        strategic mobility, would probably be interpreted abroad as final proof of
                        an isolationist trend and the adoption of the “Fortress America” concept. I
                        doubt that any eloquence or reasoning on our part would prevent
                        disintegration and deterioration of our position, with our growing isolation
                        through the reaction of our present allies. The resources of the free world
                        would then no longer be in a common fund to be drawn on for community <pb
                            xml:id="pg_459" n="459" facs="0489"/>security, and the balance of world
                        power, military and economic, would doubtless shift rapidly to our great
                        disadvantage. We would not in fact have gained greater security, and
                        expenditures would have to mount very sharply, so that any economy would be
                        shortlived.</p>
                    <p>However, for reasons above given, we cannot avoid a major reconsideration of
                        collective security concepts.</p>

                    <p>An alternative which could be explored is the possibility of taking this
                        occasion to make a spectacular effort to relax world tensions on a global
                        basis and execute such mutual withdrawals of Red Army forces and of U.S.
                        forces abroad as would itself make possible:</p>

                        achieved with an increase rather than a decline of U.S. influence and
                        without risk of our being isolated. It would also end the present state of
                        strain which breeds distrust and intolerance, which undermine our

                        general agreement with the points you make. The following are specific
                        comments:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>A. I am doubtful whether we can, as a practical matter, greatly
                            increase the emphasis we are now placing upon assuring our lead in
                            non-conventional weapons.</item>
                        <item>B. While it is true that the semi-permanent presence of United States
                            Forces (of any kind) in foreign lands is an irritant, any withdrawal
                            that seemed to imply a change in basic intent would cause real turmoil
                            abroad.</item>
                        <item>C. I note that you say the United States has put thirty billion
                            dollars of economic aid into Europe during the six years—1946–51. I
                            assume you have looked up these figures, but I have often heard Paul
                                Hoffman<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Paul Hoffman, a corporation and

                        <pb xml:id="pg_461" n="461" facs="0491"/>
                        <item>D. I am in emphatic agreement that renewed efforts should be made to
                            relax world tensions on a global basis. Mutual withdrawals of Red Army
                            Forces and of United States Forces could be suggested as a step toward
                            relaxing these tensions.</item>
                        <item>E. I agree also that whatever move we make in this field should be
                            done at a reasonably early date.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>A general comment is that programs for informing the American public, as well
                        as other populations, are indispensable if we are to do anything except to
                        drift aimlessly, probably to our own eventual destruction.</p>
                    <p>There is currently much misunderstanding among us. Our own people want tax
                        relief; but they are not well informed as to what drastic tax reduction
                        would mean to the security of the country. They have hoped, and possibly
                        believed, that the Armistice achieved on the Korean battlefield is a prelude
                        to an era of better relations between ourselves and Russia. The individual
                        feels helpless to do anything about the foreign threat that hangs over his
                        head and so he turns his attention to matters of immediate interest—farm
                        supports, Taft–Hartley Act, taxes, drought relief, and partisan politics.
                        Abroad we and our intentions are suspect because we are known to be big and
                        wealthy, and believed to be impulsive and truculent.</p>
                    <p>If we are to attempt real revision in policies—some of which may temporarily,
                        or even for a very extended time, involve us in vastly increased
                        expenditures, we must begin now to educate our people in the fundamentals of
                        these problems.</p>
                    <p>Among other things, we should describe the capabilities now and in the near
                        future of the H-bomb, supplemented by the A-bomb. We should patiently point
                        out that any group of people, such as the men in the Kremlin, who are aware
                        of the great destructiveness of these weapons—and who still decline to make
                        any honest effort toward international control by collective action—must be
                        fairly assumed to be contemplating their aggressive use. It would follow
                        that our own preparation could no longer be geared to a policy that attempts
                        only to avert disaster during the early “surprise” stages of a war, and so
                        gain time for full mobilization. Rather, we would have to be constantly
                        ready, on an instantaneous basis, to inflict greater loss upon the enemy
                        than he could reasonably hope to inflict upon us. This would be a
                        deterrent—but if the contest to maintain this relative position should have
                        to continue indefinitely, the cost would either drive us to war—or into some
                        form of dictatorial government. In such circumstances, we would be forced to
                        consider whether or not our duty to future generations did not require us to
                            <hi rend="italic">initiate</hi> war at the most propitious moment that
                        we could designate.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_462" n="462" facs="0492"/>
                    <p>I realize that none of this is new to you—in fact, we talked it all over the
                        other day. I put it down here merely to emphasize the fact that a re-study
                        of our position, and even the adoption on a unanimous basis of radically
                        revised policies by the President, the Cabinet, and the bipartisan leaders
                        of the Congress, would not, in themselves, be sufficient to assure the
                        accomplishment of the resulting objectives. <hi rend="italic">We must have
                            the enlightened support of Americans</hi> and the informed understanding
                        of our friends in the world. Moreover, all of these people would have to
                        understand that increased military preparation had been forced upon us
                        because every honest peaceful gesture or offer of our own had been summarily
                        rejected by the Communists.</p>
                    <p>I well realize that the procedures and plans for accomplishing all that I
                        have hinted at above, will first require intensive study by the ablest group
                        of individuals we can possibly assemble. We are already overworking the
                        staff of the Security Council, the only group presently established to study
                        these questions on the broadest, inter-departmental, scope. But if your
                        memorandum proves nothing else, it proves that we must get our thinking on
                        these vast problems organized and coordinated so that as a first step all in
                        responsible positions can have confidence that our conclusions are
                        essentially correct. After that a carefully thought out program of speeches,
                        national and international conferences, articles, and legislation, would be
                        in order.</p>

                            General Assembly in general debate on Sept. 17, 1953, entitled “Easing

                        corrections. However, I then remembered that you had said that you had done
                        no editing whatsoever, and so I abandoned that effort.</p>
                    <p>I think, of course, that the speech will be timely and informative. My chief
                        comment is one of a rather general character. As I read it, I had the
                        impression, particularly in the first part, that the speech is intended as a
                        new indictment of the Bolshevik Party, the USSR, and the Communist
                        Governments in the world. Now I have no quarrel with indicting and
                        condemning them, but I wonder whether or not, in front of the United Nations
                        Assembly, this would be the proper approach. Realizing that you must recite
                        certain facts and instances of guilt on the part of the Soviets, I rather
                        feel that it would be well to state flatly in the beginning that you have no
                        intention of producing a Philippic—that your purpose is to <pb
                            xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0493"/>advance the cause of conciliation
                        and understanding and not to be concerned merely with excoriation. The
                        recital, therefore, of past misdeeds, including broken faith, calumny, or
                        anything else, would be made—let us say—regretfully, and only to establish
                        the basis for proceeding more constructively in the future.</p>
                    <p>I shall not belabor this point further. You can decide whether or not it has
                        any validity. But I think that the speech can be made positive and clear
                        without giving the impression to our opponents or to our friends that we are
                        merely concerned with showing that we have been very nice people, while the
                        others have been very wicked indeed.</p>
                    <p>As for the rest, I have no detailed comments to make, but because of my
                        respect for <persName corresp="#p_LODGEHCJ1">Cabot Lodge</persName>’s
                        judgment and his familiarity with these problems, I would suggest that he be
                        consulted before your text reaches its ultimate form.</p>

                        a nationally known member of the Press. I rather think that he got out on a
                        limb and has been busily engaged in trying to show that he was correct all

                            continental defense.</note>)</p>
                    <p>With the assistance of a series of charts, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> gave an oral presentation of the
                        subject report (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159/3) which lasted over
                        an hour and which constituted a thorough and complete briefing as to the
                        general considerations, objectives, courses of action, and recommended
                        programs of the report and continental defense.</p>
                    <p>In the course of his presentation, the President interrupted Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> to ask for more detailed
                        information with respect to the program <pb xml:id="pg_466" n="466"
                            facs="0496"/>for producing a device or devices which would enable the
                        detection of fissionable material surreptitiously introduced into the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained how such
                        devices might be used, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> pointed out that no such devices had actually been
                        produced to date.</p>
                    <p>The President also inquired as to the probable date of completion of the
                        “plan” for the dispersal of essential functions of Government. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> replied that it was thought that
                        this report would be produced in a month or so, and the President commented
                        that any planning after the event (atomic attack) would be worth
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>There was also a discussion of the appropriate size of rewards which would be
                        offered by the Government for information regarding the introduction of
                        fissionable materials into the United States. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that it was proposed
                        to offer a reward of $500, 000, but that it was the opinion of the Chairman
                        of the Atomic Energy Commission that a reward of $1 million would be cheap,
                        since this would be less than the cost of the fissionable material which
                        would have been recovered.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> commented that
                        if we raised the ante too high, people would seek to introduce fissionable
                        material into the United States. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Vice President made an inquiry as to the status of reciprocity between
                        our Governments and the governments of the Soviet bloc with regard to the
                        treatment of diplomatic shipments and baggage.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMITHGC1">Smith</persName> undertook to
                        sketch the existing relationship. Although he admitted that while the
                        present situation could not be described as one of reciprocity, he
                        questioned the wisdom of our tightening up our own practices in this matter
                        at the moment when the Soviet bloc nations were liberalizing their own.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of his oral presentation, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> requested Mr. Arthur Page, as
                        spokesman for the Civilian Consultants, to express <pb xml:id="pg_467"
                            n="467" facs="0497"/>their view on the problem of continental defense.
                        Mr. Page complied by reading a statement, copy of which is filed with the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that
                        before the meeting was thrown open to general questions, the Secretary of
                        Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be invited to state
                        their views on continental defense.</p>
                    <p>Before Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> had
                        undertaken to express the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the President
                        requested him to comment on what inferences were to be drawn from a recent
                        test in Seattle in which one of our new B–52 bombers hopelessly outdistanced
                        one of our F–86 interceptors. It seemed to the President that this was a
                        development which cast doubt on the value of fighter interceptors against
                        bombers which could fly so fast at such very high altitudes as 50, 000
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> acknowledged
                        the validity of the President’s doubts, and said that it would probably be
                        possible to intercept B–52 bombers by the use of guided missiles.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> then proceeded
                        to state the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the present report. He
                        noted that the Joint Chiefs had kept in touch with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> and with the Planning Board
                        during the whole period in which this report had been developed. He said
                        that the great anxiety of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was that some particular
                        program such as this would be approved by the Council at too early a date
                        and thus tie the hands of the military in their attempts to work out an
                        appropriate over-all military program. Speaking personally, continued
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, he felt that
                        the various studies which had been made by committees and individuals on the
                        problem of continental defense had proved most valuable. On the other hand,
                        he did feel that most of these reports tended to be based on assumptions as
                        to the enemy’s capabilities. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> stated that if we continued to do this we might wind
                        up with an impossible program of continental defense.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_468" n="468" facs="0498"/>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> then said that
                        he had other points which he felt were desirable to stress. As to some of
                        the programs which were recommended for Council approval in developing an
                        adequate continental defense, real doubts had arisen in the minds of the
                        Joint Chiefs as to the validity of the recommendations. He said that the
                        Joint Chiefs were certainly reconsidering the value of seaward extensions of
                        the southern Canadian defense line at the present time. He pointed out that
                        with regard to these seaward extensions, we were counting on very nearly
                        perfect performance by those who manned the line and its extensions, 24
                        hours a day, 365 days a year, for the indefinite future. It would be
                        extraordinarily difficult to secure personnel with sufficient skill to
                        accomplish this task, and it would also be terribly expensive to maintain
                        this line once it had been developed.</p>
                    <p>Another factor which seemed deserving of the most careful study, said Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, was the loss of
                        efficiency which was inevitable when individuals were compelled to do the
                        same job day in and day out with the same instruments. He had in mind, he
                        said, radar operations in some such dreary waste as northern Canada.
                        Personnel who at the outset were 80% efficient at performing their function
                        would be, after an interval, perhaps only 30% efficient, particularly if no
                        enemy aircraft were found. This was a consideration which must certainly be
                        taken into account in evaluating the effectiveness of this kind of
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>With respect to what he called the “immediate programs”, presumably those set
                        forth in paragraph 15–a of the report, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> assured the members of the
                        Council that the Joint Chiefs regarded the development of these programs as
                        urgent, and stated that they would be included in the detailed program that
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff are formulating for the next fiscal year, <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said
                        that he wished to call the attention of the Council to the acute problem of
                        adequate military personnel and manpower. He pointed out that the
                        continental defense program outlined in the current report was a program for
                        the long pull. This being so, and in the absence of any more authority than
                        the Government now had to hold military personnel in service, he felt that
                        it might be necessary to undertake a complete reappraisal of our total
                        military capability. Actually, the problem of inadequate manpower, with
                        respect to continental defense, was a more severe problem than finance or
                        the budget. Even if we had all the funds we requested to do what we felt
                        necessary, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        said that under existing arrangements we would just not have the trained
                        people to carry out the program.</p>
                    <p>The President was the first to comment on Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>’s statement. He observed
                        that it seemed to him that the Council had <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469"
                            facs="0499"/>been tending to dodge the essential dilemma which faced the
                        country. The United States was confronted with a very terrible threat, and
                        the truth of the matter was that we have devised no way of meeting this
                        threat without imposing ever-greater controls on our economy and on the
                        freedom of our people. We had been trying, in other words, to have our cake
                        and to eat it at the same time. We were engaged, continued the President,
                        not only in saving our money or in defending our persons from attack; we
                        were engaged in the defense of a way of life, and the great danger was that
                        in defending this way of life we would find ourselves resorting to methods
                        that endangered this way of life. The real problem, as the President saw it,
                        was to devise methods of meeting the Soviet threat and of adopting controls,
                        if necessary, that would not result in our transformation into a garrison
                        state. The whole thing, said the President, was a paradox.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> commented that
                        we were not only faced with the problem of saving our free economy, but we
                        were also confronting the limitations of our manpower.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed, and said that this was only part of the paradox which
                        he had outlined, of trying to meet the threat to our values and institutions
                        by methods which themselves endangered these institutions. In any case, said
                        the President, this was a problem which must be faced and not evaded.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> admitted the
                        seriousness of the manpower problem as Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> had sketched it, but said he
                        believed that he had one or two suggestions which might assist in solving
                        it. The first of these was to provide better opportunities for technological
                        and scientific study in our high schools. He felt that in this area we had
                        been wasting our resources in the past, and that an opportunity offered to
                        increase greatly the number of students with the necessary skills of a
                        technological and scientific nature.</p>
                    <p>His second suggestion, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>, was to try to identify those areas where it might
                        be possible for the armed services to depend to a greater degree on
                        automatic devices as opposed to manual operations. This transition could,
                        thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, result in
                        greatly diminishing the number of personnel which the services now had to
                        devote to complicated scientific and technological operations.</p>
                    <p>The President’s comment on these suggestions was to point out that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> had perhaps
                        overlooked the fact that as you go into the sphere of the automatic, the
                        machine would be ever more difficult to handle and the expense of
                        maintaining it and keeping it modern would be very heavy.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_470" n="470" facs="0500"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> added that you
                        could never avoid the fact that at present it was all that the country could
                        do to maintain approximately three million men in the armed services.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D. Jackson</persName> then stated
                        that he had one further suggestion which might be of value in meeting the
                        shortage of skilled manpower. As we increasingly made use of new weapons,
                        said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName>, he saw no
                        reason why the military services should be obliged to continue their
                        elevated standards of mental and physical fitness. It seemed to him that a
                        soldier with flat feet or dandruff might be completely competent to operate
                        a Nike.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that of
                        course he was always living with the problem of manpower, and had come to
                        the conclusion that if we set ourselves an objective and proceed to convince
                        the country of the validity of that objective, we would succeed in licking
                        the manpower problem. As an example, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> cited the present two-year duration of military
                        service. This severely hampered the armed services in meeting the manpower
                        problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        expressed the view that it would be perfectly feasible to get this period of
                        service extended by the Congress if we could demonstrate a clear need for
                        such extension.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he was impressed by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s point, but could not
                        avoid the feeling that if, in the development of our mobilization base and
                        in the accumulation of weapons and materials of war, we went beyond a
                        certain point, we would have to face the likelihood that our stockpile of
                        war materials would suffer obsolescence, not to mention terrific costs of
                        maintenance. Again pointing out that we must adjust our defense program to
                        something with which we can live for a long time, the President expressed
                        the view that the desirable goal was a minimum military establishment and
                        mobilization base that could be expanded promptly in case of need. While he
                        expressed agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>’s argument that we could get the people of the
                        United States to do whatever was really necessary to preserve the national
                        security, the President did not want the American people to do what the
                        Administration deemed necessary over so long a period of time that it ended
                        in the destruction of the American way of life.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> then reverted to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName>’s suggestion for
                        ameliorating the manpower problem, and said that it was a point that must
                        never be lost sight of. He added that we had not yet made maximum use of
                        women to meet the shortage of men, and summed up his general position by a
                        statement that if we really proposed to get off of dead center, we could
                        solve the problem of manpower.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out
                        that the many difficulties and doubts which discussion thus far by the
                        members of the Council <pb xml:id="pg_471" n="471" facs="0501"/>had brought
                        out, seemed to him to indicate the impossibility for the National Security
                        Council to reach any conclusion on any single part of the national security
                        program, such as continental defense, before the members of the Council had
                        had an opportunity to view the security programs in their entirety. There
                        was no use worrying about one piece of the puzzle before you had all the
                        pieces before you. Furthermore, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said he was willing to predict that when we got all
                        through with our deliberations, the only military strength we would have
                        would be of a fluid and mobile sort.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that the important issues in continental defense which
                        must be faced at once were the fighter interceptor program and the seaward
                        extension of the southern Canadian line. He expressed agreement that the
                        latter issue might prove, upon further examination, to be somewhat academic.
                        He also stated his agreement with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> that we tended invariablby to underestimate the
                        difficulties which the USSR would encounter in making an attack upon the
                        continental United States.</p>
                    <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> asked
                        the President if it would not be appropriate to ask the heads of the various
                        departments and agencies who had entered dissents on various parts of the
                        present report, to explain their views and have their day in court.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained to the
                        President that some baggage and shipments came with the diplomat and through
                        the same port of entry, but that on other occasions such shipments would
                        come independently of their owner.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> whether he wished
                        to make a case for taking certain proposed programs out of one of the four
                        categories and placing them in another, as suggested by footnotes to the
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> replied, however,
                        that since he was now convinced that the important thing was to get behind
                        the total continental defense program, he was not inclined to argue in favor
                        of any specific changes from one category to another. He did, he said, have
                        a strong feeling that our present posture of continental defense was
                        inadequate and that we should move ahead as rapidly as possible to develop
                        the program in the present report. It was vital, for instance, from his
                        point of view to get ahead with an early warning system, since this had an
                        obvious impact on mobilization planning. He concluded by expressing the hope
                        that the Council would endorse the program as a whole even if it were
                        necessary to seek a supplemental appropriation from the Congress to finance
                        it.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_472" n="472" facs="0502"/>
                    <p>Thereafter, the Attorney General also agreed not to press for any further
                        changes in the report with regard to internal security measures, and stated
                        that he was content to have these measures left in the categories to which
                        they had been assigned in the report.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> took this
                        occasion to point out that all should understand that even if all the
                        measures in this paper were adopted it never would be possible to build a
                        100% defense of the continental United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called upon Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MEYERSH1">Howard</persName>, the Acting Federal
                        Civil Defense Administrator, as to her wishes with respect to changes in the
                        programs which the Civil Defense Administration had favored when the paper
                        was before the Planning Board.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MEYERSH1">Howard</persName> stated that in view of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s explanation of the
                        meaning of paragraphs 15–</p>
                    <p>a, –b, –c and –d, and particularly because of her very strong agreement with
                        the position just taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, she would not press for any changes in the paper
                        in behalf of the Civil Defense Administration. She did wish, she said, to
                        emphasize the need to the Council for more adequate appropriations by the
                        Congress for civil defense. She also expressed considerable skepticism as to
                        the feasibility of the recommendation by the Consultants that private
                        industry take over the task of stockpiling medical supplies for civil
                        defense purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then observed that
                        since all the members of the Council had had an opportunity to express their
                        views, he wished to invite their attention to the suggested action in the
                        Note by the Executive Secretary on page i of the report. He was also
                        suggesting a change in this form of action, which he read to the members of
                        the Council.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired whether the Consultants on the continental
                        defense problem had had access to and been briefed on all the various
                        reports which had been made in recent months on the problem. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> replied that they had had such
                        access and had been thoroughly briefed on all significant aspects of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President replied that he was not so much concerned with the leaks
                        which had appeared in the morning papers about the Council’s consideration
                        of the continental defense problem. What really concerned him was the
                        problem of public reaction to the present continental defense program in
                        view of the great hullabaloo in the press on this subject. Was the program
                        which was before the Council of sufficient size and efficiency to meet the
                        charges of the Alsops and others that the Administration was neglecting one
                        of the most crucial areas of national defense? In short, asked the Vice
                        President, were the Planning Board and the Consultants <pb xml:id="pg_473"
                            n="473" facs="0503"/>wholly satisfied that this was not a “cut-rate”
                        continental defense program?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D. Jackson</persName> stated that in
                        view of the various doubts that had been raised in the course of the
                        morning’s discussion, it would be perfectly possible for the Council to
                        decide to postpone action on continental defense. He felt, however, that a
                        decision to postpone action would be a very grave mistake. He pointed out
                        that the people of the United States are already laboring under the
                        erroneous impression that the present Administration was doing nothing in
                        this field. It was therefore important to convey to them at once and with
                        emphasis that continental defense is and has been a top priority concern of
                        this Administration. Hence the Council must make a wise decision and move
                        forward rapidly on the present program.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName>’s
                        statement, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        stated that there was no element of importance in the present report on
                        continental defense which needed to be done during this year and next year
                        that is not being done. As for certain recommended courses of action and
                        programs in the report for the years thereafter, there still was some doubt
                        as to whether we ought to carry them out. But Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he was prepared to
                        stand up today on any platform and say, with regard to continental defense,
                        that “we could not be doing more than we are now doing.”</p>
                    <p>The Vice President came back to his original point, and commented that the
                        columnists could be expected to do their utmost to suggest that there was
                        dissension within the Administration on this problem. He trusted, therefore,
                        that if a dispute developed, as, for instance, between the desirability of a
                        57-squadron and a 75-squadron fighter interceptor force, the Administration
                        would make it clear that such disagreement did not stem from motives of
                        economy alone. To this, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> answered once again that budgetary limitations were
                        not the overriding limitations in the solution of the continental defense
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The President stated, with a smile, that it was unwise for the members of the
                        Council to let themselves get so excited about what the columnists reported,
                        as to fail to use common sense in reaching a decision. He said he was
                        inclined to order the Council members in the future not to read the
                        newspapers on mornings before meetings of the National Security Council.
                        (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he had
                        one last point to make before the Council adjourned. He said that in the
                        field of intelligence with respect to early warning, he would have three
                        concrete suggestions to make at the time when the Joint Chiefs of Staff were
                        scheduled to present the Council with their detailed program on continental
                        defense.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_474" n="474" facs="0504"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he felt
                        that it was of vital importance to secure the necessary cooperation from
                        Canada in meeting the problem of civil defense.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out the difficulties which confronted the United States
                        in times of peace, in inducing other sovereign states to go along with our
                        own recommendations. He nevertheless agreed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> that present machinery for
                        cooperation on military matters with Canada could easily be improved.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, speaking to
                        this point, expressed the view that we would encounter very little
                        difficulty in getting all the cooperation and assistance we needed from the
                        Dominion.</p>
                    <p>As the meeting drew to a close, the President warmly thanked the Consultants
                        for the services that they had rendered in helping to solve this difficult
                        problem, and expressed the hope that the Consultants would regard their
                        services as not merely a duty, but also an opportunity.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Interrelation of Continental Defense to other

                    <p>1. The survival of the free world depends upon the United States maintaining:
                        (a) sufficient strength, military and non-military, to deter general war, to
                        prevent or counter aggression, and to win a general war if it is forced upon
                        us; and (b) a sound, strong economy, capable of supporting such strength
                        over the long pull and of rapidly and effectively changing to full
                        mobilization.</p>
                    <p>2. a. The strength of the United States which must be so maintained is an
                        integrated complex of offensive and defensive elements. Each of these
                        elements has its proper role in the defense of the vitals of America against
                        attack and destruction. For example, our existing commitments to help in
                        creating outposts of indigenous strength in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries and in the Orient contribute to the defense of
                        the continental United States as well as does the development of an early
                        warning system in the Western Hemisphere. Accordingly, each element of this
                        integrated complex should be in proper balance with all the other elements.
                        We shall not have satisfactory over-all strength if one element is allowed
                        to develop out of proportion to the other elements.</p>
                    <p>b. Just as there must be a proper balance among the several elements
                        comprising our strength, there must also be a proper balance between
                        military and non-military measures within the element of “continental
                        defense”.</p>
                    <p>3. In recent years we have emphasized the elements of peripheral defense,
                        offensive capabilities, and mobilization base more than we have emphasized
                        the element of “continental defense”. Yet this latter element is necessary
                        for the protection of our vitals and for the survival of our population and
                        our Government in the event of attack. “Continental Defense” is now clearly
                        inadequate.</p>

                    <p>b. Findings of the Report of the Continental Defense Committee, (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159, July 22, 1953) include:</p>
                    <p>(1) The USSR has now a growing capability to deliver a devastating atomic
                        attack on the United States, (para. 9, p. 4)</p>
                    <p>(2) Our current atomic offensive capability is a most significant deterrent
                        to Soviet atomic attack upon the continental United States. It will continue
                        to be a powerful factor in deterring hostile military action by the USSR. In
                        any program of national security, our offensive capability must be
                        maintained not only for gaining our war objectives, but for its marked
                        deterrent value in protecting our homeland, (para. 10, p. 4)</p>
                    <p>(3) The present continental defense programs are not now adequate either to
                        prevent, neutralize or seriously deter the military or covert attacks which
                        the USSR is capable of launching, nor are they adequate to ensure the
                        continuity of government, the continuity of production, or the protection of
                        the industrial mobilization base and millions of citizens in our great and
                        exposed metropolitan centers. This condition constitutes an unacceptable
                        risk to our nation’s survival, (para. 11, p. 4)</p>
                    <p>(4) The creation of a defense system approaching invulnerability is probably
                        unattainable and, as found by the Kelly Committee, is completely
                        impractical, economically and technically, in the face of expected advances
                        in Soviet offensive capabilities. However, a reasonably effective defense
                        system can and must be attained. Such a system must be phased to meet the
                        changing character of the threat, and therefore fixed programs extending
                        over a period of many years are unsound. Relatively short-term programs
                        should be embarked upon now to achieve as rapidly as possible an ability to
                        cope with the manned aircraft and submarine-launched guided missile threat
                        as it probably will exist through 1957. (Enclosure A, para. 3, p. 50)</p>
                    <p>(5) No acceptable degree of over-all defense readiness is provided in
                        programs recommended in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159 until about
                        1956. But the Continental Defense Committee concluded that, during the
                        period 1956 to about 1960, the USSR would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have
                        the net capability of destroying the war-making capacity of the United
                        States, provided:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(a) The over-all continental defense programs recommended in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159 are carried out vigorously,
                            and</item>
                        <item>(b) In the military area, the defense system not only is kept modern,
                            but the quantity of its weapons is increased consistent with any
                            significant increase in the size or performance of the Soviet long range
                            air force. This condition might obtain well into the 1960’s. Sometime
                            after 1960, due to the possible development of long range air-to-ground
                            or ground-to-ground guided missiles, there can be no assurance that the
                            proposed programs will give the high degree of protection required.
                            Unless our defensive system is constantly reviewed and kept thoroughly
                            modern, including a defense against such possibilities as an
                            intercontinental ballistic missile, we face the possibility of having
                            our continental defense program largely nullified. However, any doubt
                            about the future must not prevent us from meeting the urgent
                            requirements of the present, (para. 120, pp. 44–45)</item>

                    <p>5. There has been a growing recognition in the United States of the situation
                        outlined in the reports referred to in para. 4 above. In December, 1952, the
                        United States adopted a policy that an early warning system deemed capable
                        of providing three to six hours of warning of aircraft approaching the
                        United States from any likely direction of attack should be developed and
                        made operational as a matter of high urgency (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 139). Our most recent over-all security policy statement
                            (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1, June, 1953)<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d91fn7">Dated June 10, <ref target="#pg_378">p.
                            378</ref>.</note> emphasized the “development of a continental defense
                        system, including early warning, adequate to prevent disaster and to make
                        secure the mobilization base necessary to achieve U.S. victory in the event
                        of general war.”</p>
                    <p>6. a. The above-mentioned reports and policy statements were published prior
                        to the demonstration on August 12, 1953, of Soviet thermonuclear
                        capabilities. These papers must now be considered in the light of evidence
                        from this explosion, which indicates that the Soviets may have developed a
                        method of substantially increasing the total energy yield from their
                        available supplies of fissionable uranium. This would enable the Soviets to
                        increase the number of bombs of 30–100 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>
                        yield now estimated to be in their stockpile, or to make their weapons
                        individually more destructive, or to create very high yield weapons
                        (500–1000 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>) by accepting a reduction in
                        total number of weapons. Further, the test indicates that the USSR may have
                        reached an advanced stage in the development of true thermonuclear weapons
                        yielding more than a million tons of TNT energy equivalent.</p>
                    <p>b. The Soviet demonstration of August 12, 1953, has placed a premium
                        upon:</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Financing “Continental Defense”</p>
                    <p>7. a. Our existing national policy seeks to limit Federal expenditures to a
                        level not in excess of Federal revenues, in the interest of preserving a
                        sound and strong national economy. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954
                        the largest elements of Federal expenditures will be the total major
                        security programs, estimated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            149/2<note n="8" xml:id="d91fn8">Dated Apr. 29, <ref target="#pg_305">p.

                        billions). “Continental defense” program expenditures for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 were estimated in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159 at 4.3 billions (military at 3.8
                        billions), an increase over <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 of 1.6
                        billions.</p>
                    <p>b. In determining the source of funds to finance increased emphasis, and
                        resulting larger expenditures, on “continental defense,” full weight must be
                        placed upon new factors which have entered on the scene since the United
                        States undertook the commitments supporting some of the elements other than
                        “continental defense” in our integrated complex. These new factors are the
                        rapid approach of the Soviets to a stockpile of “atomic plenty” and the now
                        undoubted possession by the Soviets of a thermonuclear device of quality
                        indicating the use of independent technology.</p>
                    <p>c. If larger expenditures than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 are
                        to be made on “continental defense,” and the funds therefor cannot be
                        realized from savings resulting from reducing expenditures for other
                        elements in our integrated complex, then they would have to be provided in
                        addition to the expenditures for implementing such other elements. If
                        security program expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 are
                        to be less than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, and if the same
                        or larger expenditures are to be made in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1955 for “continental defense,” then the impact of the latter would fall
                        principally on expenditures for security program elements other than
                        “continental defense.” Any such lessening of security program expenditures
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 would necessitate a re-examination
                        of all U.S. security programs. The programs recommended in paragraph 15–a,
                        and presently-authorized action on other programs, should not be held up
                        pending such re-examination.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Intentions of the USSR</p>
                    <p>8. Although the USSR has a growing capability to launch an aggressive attack
                        on the United States, we believe it unlikely that the Kremlin will
                        deliberately initiate general war during the period covered by current
                        estimates (through mid-1955). However, it is possible that general war might
                        result from miscalculations by either side as a result of a series of
                        actions and counteractions not intended by either side to have that result.
                        Moveover, despite Soviet “peace offensives” and similar moves, there is no
                        substantial reason to believe that the USSR has altered its basic hostility
                        to <pb xml:id="pg_481" n="481" facs="0511"/>the free world and its ultimate
                        objective of dominating the world. Accordingly, plans for improving at home
                        the defenses of our vitals should proceed in a rapid and orderly
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scope of This Report</p>
                    <p>9. In considering the objective and courses of action which follow, these
                        points should be borne in mind:</p>
                    <p>a. The elements of continental defense included in this report are those of
                        an essentially defensive nature, and accordingly do not include those
                        elements of offensive strength of the United States and its allies which
                        contribute materially to continental defense.</p>
                    <p>b. There are included in this report certain existing programs which,
                        although contributing to continental defense, are not undertaken primarily
                        for that purpose and would be carried on in any event by the agencies
                        responsible for them. Examples of such programs are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Personnel security in the Executive Branch of the Federal
                            Government.</item>
                        <item>(2) Physical security of government facilities.</item>
                        <item>(3) Coastal escorts and coastal anti-submarine patrol.</item>
                        <item>(4) Various elements of an integrated program of counter measures for
                            the detection and prevention of clandestine introduction and detonation
                            of atomic weapons, such as F.B.I, investigations, border patrol, customs
                            and immigration procedures, passport and visa control, etc.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>c. Conversely, many of the continental defense programs will make a valuable
                        contribution to other programs. For example, the air control system can
                        increase civil air traffic capacity and reduce accidents. Nonmilitary
                        programs will be very useful in handling domestic disasters. Military forces
                        which would perform roles in the continental defense program could be
                        deployed overseas in the latter stages of a war.</p>
                    <p>d. The military programs described in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159
                        were largely based on unilateral service projection, which are still subject
                        to integration and approval by the Department of Defense and the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff. The military programs referred to in this report are
                        intended to mean those as finally approved by the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>e. This report is designed primarily to fix the timing and guidelines which
                        should govern the various continental defense programs. The costs of
                        programs in paragraph 15–a and b can be estimated with reasonable accuracy,
                        both for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1954 and 1955 and over-all. But
                        as to some of the programs in paragraph 15–c and d, cost estimates beyond
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 will necessarily depend on a
                        determination of our new basic national security policy and a detailed
                        review of our over-all military program by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
                        cost estimates of such programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955
                        will be included in the forthcoming budget submission.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Improved Intelligence</p>
                    <p>11. In view of the implications of atomic and thermonuclear weapons in the
                        hands of the Soviet Union, greater knowledge of Soviet capabilities and
                        intentions is essential for military and non-military measures to reach
                        maximum effectiveness.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Agreements with Canada</p>
                    <p>12. Canadian agreement and participation on an adequate scale is essential to
                        any effective continental defense system. Although machinery for reaching
                        and implementing agreements exists, the Canadian government should at once
                        be approached at the highest levels in order to establish a common
                        appreciation of the urgency and character of the threat to U.S.-Canadian
                        security and the measures required to meet it. Exploration should be made of
                        the extent to which Canada may wish to take leadership in developing parts
                        of the system and in contributing to its expense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Research and Development</p>
                    <p>13. Adequate support for coordinated programs of basic and applied research
                        and development is essential to gain and maintain the required technological
                        superiority over the USSR. Weapons development by us has acquired even
                        greater importance with the development by the USSR of a thermonuclear
                        capability. Basic and applied research must keep abreast of the changing
                        Soviet threat, including intercontinental ballistic guided missiles.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Early Warning System</p>
                    <p>16. a. An early warning system providing a minimum of at least two hours is
                        an immediate necessity for both military and non-military measures for
                        continental defense. The Southern Canadian Detector Line and the Alaska and
                        Northeast Air Control and Warning Systems should be completed as early as
                        possible. Seaward extensions of this line to Hawaii and to the Azores should
                        be provided, beginning with the Atlantic extension, utilizing the minimum
                        number of ships and aircraft determined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be
                        necessary to meet the threat and enemy capabilities at any given time. In
                        planning these seaward extensions, the maximum use should be planned of
                        these installations for other purposes such as weather reporting, search and
                        rescue, etc., in order to eliminate program duplication.</p>
                    <p>b. A longer warning than will be afforded by installing the Southern Canadian
                        Detector Line is presently desirable and, in view of anticipated increases
                        in speed of aircraft, will probably be <pb xml:id="pg_485" n="485"

                        Project Corrode and the report of the Canada–U.S. Military Study Group, the
                        Northern Canadian Detector Line is deemed feasible, plans and preparation
                        for its installation should be made as if the program were included in para.
                        15–a. Project Corrode should be carried forward with the greatest feasible
                        speed.</p>

                    <p>17. Even with early warning, effective fighter control is impracticable
                        without accurate means of identification and contiguous radar coverage to
                        seaward of our coastlines. Therefore, an increase of identification
                        capabilities, such as through the utilization of Consolan radio stations and
                        the extension to seaward of contiguous radar coverage, should be completed
                        with the same urgency as the provision of early warning. As the early
                        warning aircraft identification systems and contiguous radar coverage are
                        completed they should be supplemented during the next two years with
                        programs such as:</p>

                    <p>18. a. The recent Soviet thermonuclear test brings home that it is essential
                        that within the next two years the capability to destroy attacking aircraft
                        and submarines before reaching their targets should be substantially
                        augmented. In fact, all possible efforts should be made to expedite the
                        equipping of adequate forces with aircraft and missiles which will achieve a
                        high “kill ratio” before attacking forces reach our borders. These forces
                        must not only be kept modern, but force levels may have to be increased
                        consistent with any significant increase in Soviet capabilities. This
                        process will be costly but essential if the objectives of the Continental
                        Defense Program are to be achieved. It should be realized, on the other
                        hand, that some of these forces deployed initially for continental defense
                        could be of great value in other areas and roles in the event of a long war.
                        To this extent they contribute materially to our over-all military
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>b. In determining the forces and weapons required under this program, every
                        effort should be made to insure that the maximum utilization of existing
                        equipment and forces is achieved. This will require a careful evaluation of
                        the disposition of U.S. forces and material world-wide.</p>

                        utmost urgency. Within the next two years an emergency plan should be

                            <p>a. The formidable power and aggressive policy of the communist world
                                led by the USSR; from which may result either (1) a prolonged

                                reaches atomic plenty, and the balance of relative power positions

                                our revenues, or (2) the change in our way of life through
                                increasing our fiscal and manpower burdens for defense over a

                            <p>The United States must strike a proper balance between the risks

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Threat to the United States</p>
                    <p>1. The primary threat to the security, free institutions, and fundamental
                        values of the United States is posed by the combination of:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Basic Soviet hostility to the non-communist world, particularly to
                            the United States.</item>
                        <item>b. Great Soviet military power.</item>
                        <item>c. Soviet control of the international communist apparatus and other
                            means of subversion or division of the free world.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. a. The authority of the Soviet regime does not appear to have been
                        impaired by the events since <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName>’s death, or to be likely to be appreciably weakened
                        during the next few years. The transfer of power may cause some uncertainty
                        in Soviet and satellite tactics for some time, but will probably not impair
                        the basic economic and military strength of the Soviet bloc. The Soviet
                        rulers can be expected to continue to base their policy on the conviction of
                        irreconcilable hostility between the bloc and the non-communist world. This
                        conviction is the compound product of Marxist belief in their historically
                        determined conflict with, and inevitable triumph over, “world capitalism”
                        led by the United States, of fear for the security <pb xml:id="pg_492"
                            n="492" facs="0522"/>of the regime and the USSR, especially in the face
                        of a hostile coalition, of distrust of U.S. aims and intentions, and of
                        long-established reliance on techniques of conspiracy and subversion.
                        Accordingly, the basic Soviet objectives continue to be consolidation and
                        expansion of their own sphere of power and the eventual domination of the
                        non-communist world.</p>
                    <p>b. Soviet strategy has been flexible and will probably continue so, allowing
                        for retreats and delays as well as advances. The various “peace gestures” so
                        far have cost the Soviets very little in actual concessions and could be
                        merely designed to divide the West by raising false hopes and seeking to
                        make the United States appear unyielding. It is possible, however, that the
                        USSR, for internal and other reasons, may desire a settlement of specific
                        issues or a relaxation of tensions and military preparations for a
                        substantial period. Thus far, there are no convincing signs of readiness to
                        make important concessions to this end.</p>

                        inflict serious damage on the United States, especially by surprise attack.
                        The USSR soon may have the capability of dealing a crippling blow to our
                        industrial base and our continued ability to prosecute a war. Effective
                        defense could reduce the likelihood and intensity of a hostile attack but
                        not eliminate the possibility of a crippling blow.</p>
                    <p>b. The USSR now devotes about one-sixth of its gross national product to
                        military outlays and is expected to continue this level. It has and will
                        continue to have large conventional military forces capable of aggression
                        against countries of the free world. Within the next two years, the Soviet
                        bloc is not expected to increase the size of its forces, but will strengthen
                        them with improved equipment and training and the larger atomic
                        stockpile.</p>
                    <p>c. The Soviet bloc now has the capability of strong defense against air
                        attack on critical targets within the USSR under favorable weather
                        conditions, and is likely to continue to strengthen its all-weather air
                        defenses.</p>
                    <p>4 a. The recent uprisings in East Germany and the unrest in other European
                        satellites evidence the failure of the Soviets fully to subjugate these
                        peoples or to destroy their desire for freedom; <pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493"
                            facs="0523"/>the dependence of these satellite governments on Soviet
                        armed forces; and the relative unreliability of satellite armed forces
                        (especially if popular resistance in the satellites should increase). These
                        events necessarily have placed internal and psychological strains upon the
                        Soviet leadership. Nevertheless, the ability of the USSR to exercise
                        effective control over and to exploit the resources of the European
                        satellites remains intact, so long as it maintains military forces in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>b. The detachment of any major European satellite from the Soviet bloc does
                        not now appear feasible except by Soviet acquiescence or by war. Such a
                        detachment would not decisively affect the Soviet military capability either
                        in delivery of weapons of mass destruction or in conventional forces but
                        would be a considerable blow to Soviet prestige and might impair in some
                        degree Soviet conventional military capabilities in Europe.</p>
                    <p>c. The Chinese Communist regime is firmly in control and is unlikely to be
                        shaken in the foreseeable future by domestic forces or rival regimes, short
                        of the occurrence of a major war. The alliance between the regimes of
                        Communist China and the USSR is based on common ideology and current
                        community of interests. With the death of <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> and the Korean truce, Communist China may tend more
                        to emphasize its own interests, though limited by its present economic and
                        military dependence on the USSR, and, in the long run, basic differences may
                        strain or break the alliance. At present, however, it appears to be firmly
                        established and adds strategic territory and vast reserves of military
                        manpower to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>5. a. The USSR does not seem likely deliberately to launch a general war
                        against the United States during the period covered by current estimates
                        (through mid-1955). The uncertain prospects for Soviet victory in a general
                        war, the change in leadership, satellite unrest, and the U.S. capability to
                        retaliate massively, make such a course improbable. Similarly, an attack on
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries or other areas would be
                        almost certain to bring on general war, and in view of U.S. commitments or
                        intentions, would be unlikely. The Soviets will not, however, be deterred by
                        fear of general war from taking the measures they consider necessary to
                        counter Western actions which they view as a serious threat to their
                        security.</p>
                    <p>b. When both the USSR and the U.S. reach a stage of atomic plenty and ample
                        means of delivery, each will have the probable capacity to inflict critical
                        damage on the other, but is not likely to be able to prevent major atomic
                        retaliations. This could create a stalemate, with both sides reluctant to
                        initiate general warfare; although if the Soviets believed that initial
                        surprise held the prospect of destroying the capacity for retaliation, they
                        might be tempted into attacking.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_494" n="494" facs="0524"/>
                    <p>c. Although Soviet fear of atomic reaction should still inhibit local
                        aggression, increasing Soviet atomic capability may tend to diminish the
                        deterrent effect of U.S. atomic power against peripheral Soviet aggression.
                        It may also sharpen the reaction of the USSR to what it considers
                        provocative acts of the United States. If either side should miscalculate
                        the strength of the other’s reaction, such local conflicts could grow into
                        general war, even though neither seeks or desires it. To avoid this, it will
                        in general be desirable for the United States to make clear to the USSR the
                        kind of actions which will be almost certain to lead to this result,
                        recognizing, however, that as general war becomes more devastating for both
                        sides the threat to resort to it becomes less available as a sanction
                        against local aggression.</p>
                    <p>6. The USSR will continue to rely heavily on tactics of division and
                        subversion to weaken the free world alliances and will to resist the Soviet
                        power. Using both the fear of atomic warfare and the hope of peace, such
                        political warfare will seek to exploit differences among members of the free
                        world, neutralist attitudes, and anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments in
                        underdeveloped areas. For these purposes communist parties and other
                        cooperating elements will be used to manipulate opinion and control
                        governments wherever possible. This aspect of the Soviet threat is likely to
                        continue indefinitely and to grow in intensity.</p>
                    <p>7. Over time, changes in the outlook and policies of the leadership of the
                        USSR may result from such factors as the slackening of revolutionary zeal,
                        the growth of vested managerial and bureaucratic interests, and popular
                        pressures for consumption goods. Such changes, combined with the growing
                        strength of the free world and the failure to break its cohesion, and
                        possible aggravation of weaknesses within the Soviet bloc through U.S. or
                        allied action or otherwise, might induce a willingness to negotiate. The
                        Soviet leadership might find it desirable and even essential to reach
                        agreements acceptable to the United States and its allies, without
                        necessarily abandoning its basic hostility to the non-Soviet world.</p>

                    <p>8. In the face of the Soviet threat, the security of the United States
                        requires:</p>
                    <p>a. Development and maintenance of the necessary capability:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) To inflict massive retaliatory damage by offensive strategic
                            striking power;</item>
                        <item>(2) To provide U.S. and allied forces in readiness to move rapidly to
                            counter local aggression by Soviet bloc forces or to hold vital areas
                            and lines of communication in case of general war; and</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_495" n="495" facs="0525"/>
                        <item>(3) To provide a mobilization base, and its protection against
                            crippling damage, adequate to insure victory in the event of general
                            war.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>b. Maintenance of a sound, strong and growing economy, capable of supporting
                        through the operation of free institutions such capability over the long
                        pull and of rapidly and effectively changing to full mobilization.</p>
                    <p>c. Maintenance of morale and free institutions and the willingness of the
                        U.S. people to support the measures necessary for national security.</p>
                    <p>9. Within the free world, only the United States can provide and maintain,
                        for a period of years to come, the atomic capability to counterbalance
                        Soviet atomic power. Thus, sufficient atomic weapons and effective means of
                        delivery are indispensable for U.S. security. Moreover, in the face of
                        Soviet atomic power, defense of the continental United States becomes vital
                        to effective security: to protect our striking force, our mobilization base,
                        and our people. Such atomic capability is also a major contribution to the
                        security of our allies, as well as of this country.</p>
                    <p>10. The United States cannot, however, meet its defense needs, even at
                        exorbitant cost, without the support of allies.</p>
                    <p>a. The effective use of U.S. strategic air power against the USSR will
                        require overseas bases on foreign territory for some years to come. Such
                        bases will continue indefinitely to be an important additional element of
                        U.S. strategic air capability and to be essential to the conduct of the
                        military operations on the Eurasian continent in case of general war. The
                        availability of such bases and their use by the United States in case of
                        need will depend, in most cases, on the consent and cooperation of the
                        nations where they are located. Such nations will assume the risks entailed
                        only if convinced that their own security will thereby be best served.</p>
                    <p>b. The United States needs to have aligned on its side in the world struggle,
                        in peace and in war, the armed forces and economic resources of the major
                        highly-industrialized non-communist states. Progressive loss to the Soviet
                        bloc of these states would so isolate the United States and alter the world
                        balance as to endanger the capacity of the United States to win in the event
                        of general war or to maintain an adequate defense without undermining its
                        fundamental institutions.</p>

                        their national interests may be divergent from the basic requirements for

                    <p>d. Our allies are, in turn, dependent on the United States for their
                        security: (1) they lack that atomic capability which is the major deterrent
                        to Soviet aggression; (2) most lack political and economic stability
                        sufficient to support their military forces. The United States should be
                        able for the foreseeable future to provide military aid, in more limited
                        amounts than heretofore, to our essential allies. It should be possible in
                        the near future, however, generally to eliminate most grant economic aid if
                        coupled with appropriate U.S. economic and trade policies.</p>
                    <p>11. a. Under existing treaties or policies, an attack on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Western Germany, Berlin,
                        Japan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and the American Republics
                        or on the Republic of Korea, would involve the United States in war with the
                        USSR, or at least with Communist China if the aggression were Chinese
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>b. Certain other countries, such as Indochina or Formosa are of such
                        strategic importance to the United States that an attack on them probably
                        would compel the United States to react with military force either locally
                        at the point of attack or generally against the military power of the
                        aggressor. Moreover, the principle of collective security through the United
                        Nations, if it is to continue to survive as a deterrent to continued
                        piecemeal aggression and a promise of an eventual effective world security
                        system, should be upheld even in areas not of vital strategic
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>c. The assumption by the United States, as the leader of the free world, of a
                        substantial degree of responsibility for the freedom and security of the
                        free nations is a direct and essential contribution to the maintenance of
                        its own freedom and security.</p>

                        world strength, or to afford breathing-space to the Soviets better to
                        prepare for aggression.</p>
                    <p>b. It must be recognized, however, that the prospects for acceptable
                        negotiated settlements are not encouraging. There is no evidence that the
                        Soviet leadership is prepared to modify its basic attitudes and accept any
                        permanent settlement with the United States, although it may be prepared for
                        a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> on certain issues. Atomic and other
                        major weapons can be controlled only by adequate and enforceable safeguards
                        which would involve some form of international inspection and supervision.
                        Acceptance of such serious restrictions by either side would be extremely
                        difficult under existing conditions of suspicion and distrust. The chances
                        for such disarmament would perhaps be improved by agreements on other
                        conflicts either beforehand or at the same time, or by possible realization
                        by the Soviets, in time, that armament limitation will serve their own
                        interests and security.</p>
                    <p>c. The United States should promptly determine what it would accept as an
                        adequate system of armament control which would effectively remove or reduce
                        the Soviet atomic and military threat, and what concession it would be
                        prepared to offer to obtain it.</p>

                        the strength, cohesion and common determination of the free world has
                        succeeded in increasing its relative strength and may well have prevented

                        associated forces are now sufficient to make aggressive action in Europe <pb

                        carry out its role of preventing a full-scale Soviet attack from overrunning
                        Western Europe. Nor will this goal be fully achieved by continuing present
                        rates of defense spending in Europe and present rates of U.S. military
                        assistance, even with the inclusion of German forces in the
                        presently-planned <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. It is essential that
                        the Western European states build and maintain maximum feasible defensive
                        strength. The major deterrent to aggression against Western Europe is the
                        manifest determination of the United States to use its atomic capability and
                        massive retaliatory striking power if the area is attacked. However, the
                        presence of U.S. forces in Western Europe makes a contribution other than
                        military to the strength and cohesion of the free world coalition.</p>
                    <p>c. In the Far East, military strength of the coalition now rests largely on
                        U.S. military power plus that of France in Indochina, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in Malaya and Hong Kong, and the indigenous
                        forces of the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and Nationalist China. Any
                        material increase will require the revival of the economic and military
                        strength of Japan.</p>
                    <p>d. The strength and cohesion of the coalition depends, and will continue to
                        depend, on the continuing strength and will of the United States as its
                        leader, and upon the assumption by each coalition member of a proper share
                        of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>14. While the coalition is founded on common interest and remains basically
                        sound, certain factors tend to weaken its cohesion and to slow down the
                        necessary buildup of strength.</p>
                    <p>a. Some of these factors are inherent in the nature of a coalition led by one
                        strong power. The economic and military recovery by our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies from their low point of a few
                        years ago, and the revival of Germany and Japan has given them a greater
                        sense of independence from U.S. guidance and direction. Specific sources of
                        irritation are trade with the Soviet bloc, the level of the defense effort,
                        use of bases and other facilities, and the prospect of the discontinuance of
                        U.S. economic aid without a corresponding change in U.S. trade policies.</p>
                    <p>b. The coalition also suffers from certain other weaknesses and dilemmas. The
                        colonial issue in Asia and Africa, for example, has not only weakened our
                        European allies but has left those areas in a state of ferment which weakens
                        the whole free world. Efforts by the United States to encourage orderly
                        settlements tend to leave both sides dissatisfied and to create friction
                        within the alliance. Age-old issues such as divide France and Germany, or
                        Italy and <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0529"/>Yugoslavia, still impede
                        creation of a solid basis of cooperation against the Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p>c. Moreover, allied opinion, especially in Europe, has become less willing to
                        follow U.S. leadership. Many Europeans fear that American policies,
                        particularly in the Far East, may involve Europe in general war, or will
                        indefinitely prolong cold-war tensions. Many consider U.S. attitudes toward
                        the Soviets as too rigid and unyielding and, at the same time, as unstable,
                        holding risks ranging from preventive war and “liberation” to withdrawal
                        into isolation. Many consider that these policies fail to reflect the
                        perspective and confidence expected in the leadership of a great nation, and
                        reflect too great a preoccupation with anti-communism. Important sectors of
                        allied opinion are also concerned over developments within the United States
                        which seem to them inconsistent with our assumed role of leader in the cause
                        of freedom. These attitudes materially impair cooperation with our allies
                        and, if not overcome, could imperil the coalition.</p>
                    <p>d. Fear of what a general war will mean for them is deeply rooted and
                        widespread among our allies. They tend to see the actual danger of Soviet
                        aggression as less imminent than the U.S. does, and some have a fatalistic
                        feeling that if it is coming they will not be able to do much about it. In
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, many have serious
                        doubts whether the defense requirements can be met without intolerable
                        political and economic strains. Certain of our allies fear the rearmament of
                        Germany and Japan on any large scale, and in Germany and Japan themselves
                        strong currents of opinion oppose it as unnecessary or dangerous. Moreover,
                        in certain countries, particularly France and Italy, grave domestic problems
                        have called into question not only the authority of the governments but also
                        the basic foreign policies and alignments which they have followed. All
                        these factors lead to allied pressure in favor of new major efforts to
                        negotiate with the USSR as the only hope of ending the present tension, fear
                        and frustration. This pressure has increased with recent “peace gestures” of
                        the new Soviet leadership, which has made every endeavor to exploit it.
                        Whether these hopes are illusory or well-founded, they must be taken into
                        consideration by the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Uncommitted Areas of the World</p>
                    <p>15. Despite the Soviet threat, many nations and societies outside the Soviet
                        bloc, mostly in the under-developed areas, are so unsure of their national
                        interests, or so preoccupied with other pressing problems, that they are
                        presently unwilling to align themselves actively with the United States and
                        its allies. Although largely undeveloped, their vast manpower, their
                        essential raw materials and <pb xml:id="pg_500" n="500" facs="0530"/>their
                        potential for growth are such that their absorption within the Soviet system
                        would greatly, perhaps decisively, alter the world balance of power to our
                        detriment. Conversely, their orderly development into more stable and
                        responsible nations, able and willing to participate in defense of the free
                        world, can increasingly add to its strength.</p>
                    <p>16. In many of these uncommitted areas, forces of unrest and of resentment
                        against the West are strong. Among their sources are racial feelings,
                        anti-colonialism, rising nationalism, popular demand for rapid social and
                        economic progress, over-population, the breakdown of static social patterns,
                        and, in many cases, the conflict of local religious and social philosophies
                        with those of the West. The task of building firm ties with these nations,
                        counteracting neutralism, and solving their problems is complicated by the
                        general unreliability of their governments and volatility of their political
                        life. Outside economic assistance alone cannot be counted on either to solve
                        their basic problems or to win their cooperation and support. In addition,
                        constructive political and other measures will be required to create a sense
                        of mutuality of interest with the free world and to counter the communist
                        appeals.</p>

                        living standards and free institutions. Not only the world position of the
                        United States but the security of the whole free world is dependent on the
                        avoidance of recession and on the long-term expansion of the U.S. economy.
                        Threats to its stability or growth, therefore, constitute a danger to the

                        Expenditures for national security, in fact all federal, state and local

                        measuring their impact on the national economy.</p>
                    <p>18. The economy of the country has a potential for long-term economic growth.
                        Over the years an expanding national income can provide the basis for higher
                        standards of living and for a substantial military program. But economic
                        growth is not automatic and requires fiscal and other policies which will
                        foster and not <pb xml:id="pg_501" n="501" facs="0531"/>hamper the potential

                    <p>19. Excessive government spending leads to inflationary deficits or to
                        repressive taxation, or to both. Persistent inflation is a barrier to
                        long-term growth because it undermines confidence in the currency, reduces
                        savings, and makes restrictive economic controls necessary. Repressive
                        taxation weakens the incentives for efficiency, effort, and investment on
                        which economic growth depends.</p>

                    <p>21. In spite of the reimposition of tax rates at approximately the peak
                        levels of World War II, expenditures have risen faster than tax receipts,
                        with a resulting deficit of $9.4 billion in fiscal year 1953. Despite
                        anticipated larger receipts, without the imposition of new taxes, and
                        assuming substantially unchanged world conditions, a deficit of $3.8 billion
                        is estimated for fiscal year 1954.</p>
                    <p>22. a. Under existing law, tax reductions of $5 billion a year will become
                        effective next January. A proposal to impose substitute taxes therefor would
                        be a reversal of policy.</p>
                    <p>b. Additional revenue losses of $3 billion a year are due to occur on April
                        1, 1954. Congress has not acted on the President’s recommendation that these
                        reductions be rescinded. Even if the $3 billion reduction is rescinded, or
                        offset by revenue from new sources, large deficits would occur in <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FY</gloss> 1955 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>

                    <p>23. The economic problem is made more difficult by the need to reform the tax
                        system in the interests of long-term economic growth. Inevitably, many of
                        the changes necessary to reduce the barriers to growth will lead to a loss
                        of revenue in the years immediately following their adoption. [Because
                        income tax rates are already repressive, and at the upper levels have
                        reached the point of diminishing returns,]<note n="‡‡" xml:id="d92fn-sym81"

                        taxation on a broad base.</p>
                    <p>24. The present high level of the Government debt further complicates the
                        financial and economic problems of the country. Substantial <pb
                            xml:id="pg_502" n="502" facs="0532"/>additional borrowing could come
                        only from sources which would be inflationary.</p>
                    <p>25. There is no precise level or duration of Government expenditures which
                        can be predetermined in advance, at which an economic system will be
                        seriously damaged from inflationary borrowing on the one hand or from
                        destructive taxation on the other. The higher the level of expenditures, the
                        greater is the need for sound policies and the greater are the dangers of
                        miscalculations and mischance. These dangers now are substantial.</p>
                    <p>26. The requirements for funds to maintain our national security must thus be
                        considered in the light of these dangers to our economic system, including
                        the danger to industrial productivity necessary to support military
                        programs, arising from excessive levels of total Government spending, taxing
                        and borrowing.</p>
                    <p>27. Modifications of the foregoing fiscal policies to promote long-term
                        growth may be necessitated for a limited period: (1) to deal with short-term
                        cyclical problems or (2) to achieve overriding national objectives that
                        justify departure from sound fiscal policies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation as to U.S. Manpower</p>
                    <p>28. a. The national security programs of the United States rest upon the
                        manpower to operate them, the economy to produce the material for them, and
                        the financial resources to pay for them.</p>
                    <p>b. In order to carry on our existing military programs we must utilize
                        substantially all the qualified manpower annually coming of military age.
                        Any considerable increase in the military demand for manpower would have to
                        be met through enlarged compulsion on citizens of maturer age, through
                        increased expenditures for enlistment and reenlistment incentives, and
                        through longer enlistments.</p>
                    <p>c. The continuing development of more complicated weapons, machines, and
                        devices used by the military greatly increases the need for military
                        manpower possessed of higher skills, and emphasizes the need for expanded
                        technical training and retention of technically trained personnel.</p>

                        the United States and its allies suitably deployed and adequate to deter or
                        counter local aggression; and an adequate mobilization base; all supported
                        by the determined spirit of the U.S. people.</p>
                    <p>b. Such strength is essential to counter the Soviet divisive tactics and hold
                        together the coalition. If our allies were uncertain about our ability or
                        will to counter Soviet aggression, they would be strongly tempted to adopt a
                        neutralist position, especially in the face of the atomic threat.</p>
                    <p>34. In the interest of its own security, the United States must have the
                        support of allies.</p>
                    <p>a. The military striking power necessary to retaliate depends for the
                        foreseeable future on having bases in allied countries. Furthermore, the
                        forces required to counter local aggressions must be supplied largely by our
                        allies and cannot be furnished by the United States.</p>
                    <p>b. The loss of major allies by subversion, divisive tactics, or the growth of
                        neutralist attitudes, would seriously affect the security of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>35. United States policies must, therefore, be designed to obtain the
                        cooperation of our allies and strengthen the cohesion of the free world.</p>
                    <p>a. Our allies must be genuinely convinced that our strategy is one of
                        collective security. The alliance must be rooted in a strong feeling of a
                        community of interest and firm confidence in the steadiness and wisdom of
                        U.S. leadership.</p>
                    <p>b. Cooperative efforts, including equitable contributions by our allies, will
                        continue to be necessary to build the military, economic and political
                        strength of the coalition and the stability of the free world.</p>
                    <p>c. Constructive U.S. policies, not related solely to anti-communism, are

                            countries and to economic policies which will serve as a substitute for
                            aid. These points are more adequately covered in the present agreed text

                        achieve a stronger Europe, the United States should support, as long as
                        there is hope of early success, the building of an integrated European
                        Community (including West Germany and if possible a united Germany), linked

                                appropriate tax and fiscal measures. Without minimizing the strong
                                opposition to high taxation, it is believed that the United States
                                public can be expected to support the requisite measures and

                        eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary overhead in the Federal
                        Government, and to minimize Federal expenditures for programs that are not
                        essential to the national security.</p>
                    <p>e. [d.] The economic potential of private enterprise should be maximized by
                        minimizing governmental controls and regulations, and by encouraging private
                        enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g. nuclear
                        power).</p>
                    <p>f. [e.] The United States should seek to maintain a larger and expanding rate
                        of economic activity at relatively stable price levels.</p>

                    <p>40. To support the necessarily heavy burdens for national security, the
                        morale of the citizens of the United States must be based both on
                        responsibility and freedom for the individual. The dangers from Soviet
                        subversion and espionage require strong and effective security measures.
                        Eternal vigilance, however, is needed in their exercise to prevent
                        degeneration which might involve the intimidation of free criticism. It is
                        essential that necessary measures of protection should not be so used as to
                        destroy the national unity based on the lasting values of freedom, not on
                        fear.</p>

                                on the minority peoples of the USSR.</p>
                            <p>“The main point of the paragraph is that the U.S. should make clear

                        allies should make clear to the leaders and people of the USSR that they are
                        prepared to accept a settlement recognizing the territorial integrity and
                        internal political and economic organization of the USSR, provided that the
                        USSR foregoes external expansion and domination of other peoples and joins

                        influence in the free world, the United States should:</p>
                    <p>a. Take overt and covert measures to discredit Soviet prestige and ideology
                        as effective instruments of Soviet power, and to reduce the strength of

                    <p>b. Take all feasible diplomatic, political, economic and covert measures to
                        counter any threat of a party or individuals directly or indirectly
                        responsive to Soviet control to achieve dominant power in a free world

                    <p>44. In the face of the developing Soviet threat, the broad aim of U.S.
                        security policies must be to create, prior to the achievement of mutual
                        atomic plenty, conditions under which the United States and the free world
                        coalition are prepared to meet the Soviet-Communist threat with resolution
                        and to negotiate for its alleviation under proper safeguards. The United
                        States and its allies must always seek to create and sustain the hope and
                        confidence of the free world in the ability of its basic ideas and
                        institutions not merely to oppose the communist threat, but to provide a way
                        of life superior to Communism.</p>
                    <p>45. The foregoing conclusions are valid only so long as the United States
                        maintains a retaliatory capability that cannot be neutralized by a surprise
                        Soviet attack. Whenever there is substantial evidence that the USSR is
                        likely to develop the capability to knock out our atomic striking power, the
                        entire policy of the United States toward the USSR will have to be radically
                        re-examined.</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> first briefed the
                        Council on the historical background of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162. He then explained the manner in which the present report had been
                        drafted, the important differences which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162 contained, and expressed the hope that the Council would be able in the
                        course of its consideration to resolve these differences of opinion and
                        arrive at an agreed statement of policy. In order to assist in this process,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that he had
                        attempted to reduce the statement of these differences in each case to a
                        paragraph and suggested that the Council discuss each of these paragraphs
                        and come to an agreement to resolve the differences.</p>
                    <p>The first of these differences concerned the nature of the Soviet threat.
                        Side “A”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out,
                        sees the threat to the United States as the basic Soviet hostility to the
                        United States and the Soviet’s formidable military power. While
                        acknowledging a sound U.S. economy is essential, Side “A” believes the
                        United States <hi rend="italic">must</hi> first meet necessary security
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>Side “B”, on the other hand, sees the threat to the United States as a dual
                        threat—the external threat of Soviet power; the internal threat of weakening
                        our economy and changing our way of life. Side “B” believes the U.S. must
                        strike a proper balance between the risks arising from these two
                        threats.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> finished his
                        exposition of this difference, the President inquired whether Side “A” would
                        sustain its position even if it proved necessary to go to the lengths of
                        general mobilization and the imposition of tight controls on the economy.
                        The President readily agreed that you could get the American people steamed
                        up to do whatever you told them was necessary for a certain length of time.
                        If, however, this process was to go on indefinitely, it would be necessary
                        to resort to compulsory controls. If Side “A”, said the President, backs up
                        its position to the ultimate <pb xml:id="pg_516" n="516" facs="0546"/>limit
                        it would lead to both general mobilization and out-and-out
                        regimentation.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the President’s question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> stated that, by implication at least, Side “A’s”
                        answer was to be found on page 27 of the report, which contained the
                        statement in paragraph 39–b “The United States must, however, meet the
                        necessary costs of the policies essential for its security.”</p>
                    <p>Although the President observed that he thought that this amounted to hedging
                        and that the statement contained contradictions, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> answered that by implication at
                        least Side “A” was prepared to go to full mobilization and controls if this
                        were necessary to safeguard the national security.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Budget explained that the basic objection of the Budget
                        and the Treasury to Side “A’s” statement as to the nature of the threat was
                        that it ignored the economic threat at the very outset of the report. It
                        chose to do this even though all of us know that it is an objective of
                        Soviet strategy to destroy our capitalist economy by means of economic
                        warfare. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> gave it as his
                        opinion that this was a very successful element of the Soviet strategy
                        although it was not so dangerous as the H-bomb. In sum, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> argued that as the threat to the
                        economy was part and parcel of the Soviet threat, it should be mentioned at
                        the beginning and not relegated to later pages in the report.</p>
                    <p>The President digressed for a moment to discuss statements by Government
                        officials with regard to the H-bomb (see previous item) and then went back
                        to comment on the view just expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName>. He expressed agreement with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> that if you ignored this economic
                        threat, you are simply refusing to be realistic. If Side “A” was really
                        prepared to envisage expenditures to a point which would produce compulsory
                        controls or general mobilization it should say so and the President would
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> stated that he
                        could not agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s
                        position. While the threat to the economy was real, it was not clearly set
                        forth by the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget in the language of Side
                        “B”. Incidentally, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>, he would like to know who was on side “A” and who on
                        Side “B”. The President replied that he would prefer not to know who was on
                        what side and that the Council could accomplish its task more effectively if
                        the identity of the members of the two sides was not an issue.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                        was essential to get beyond disagreements in language to divergences of
                        thought which were obviously very deep. Actually the issue of the nature of
                        the threat was the number one problem facing the Administration. It must,
                        therefore, be thoroughly talked out among friends whose only interest <pb
                            xml:id="pg_517" n="517" facs="0547"/>was to save their country. The
                        issue, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, was even more clearly posed on the first page of
                        the comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">A copy of the 10-page

                            files, lot 61 D 167, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162.</note> On
                        this page the Joint Chiefs had argued against including a reference to the
                        economic threat as more than an incidental threat. Moreover, the Joint
                        Chiefs’ paper had argued that we must take measures to defeat the external
                        Soviet threat even if in the process we changed our way of life. At least,
                        said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, these
                        statements clearly posed the real issue. The great difficulty, of course,
                        was that we don’t really have all the facts we need either on the nature of
                        the Soviet threat or on the nature of the economic threat. On top of this
                        problem was the question of timing. There were plenty of things that you
                        could stand for one year that you might not be able to stand for ten years.
                        Are we going to meet this threat, asked Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, in the same way that the
                        previous Administration had tried to meet it. To decide on some future D-day
                        and then try desperately and in the shortest possible time to rearm the
                        country to a point which might enable it to meet this threat; or do we
                        propose to consider ways and means of meeting a threat which will be with us
                        over a very long time. It was important to decide this, thought Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, because over the
                        long haul we could easily be destroyed by either of the two threats,
                        external or internal. If we mean to face this Soviet threat over a long time
                        we must spend less than we are now spending and do less than we are now
                        doing. If, on the other hand, we believe that we must anticipate a Soviet
                        attack in a year’s time or that we might be compelled to attack the Soviet
                        Union, then obviously we ought to do and spend more than we are doing and
                        spending now. This, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, seemed to him the essence of the issue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State commented that it was not wholly clear to him what
                        adoption of the present report would really decide. If adoption of the paper
                        meant that the United States was going ahead to balance its budget and cut
                        its taxes and that everything else must give way to this objective, he was
                        strongly against it. This would be a decision reached in the dark. With
                        obvious emotion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> pointed out that as yet the National Security Council
                        had been presented with no precise estimates of the costs to maintain the
                        defense system of the free world coalition. No one knew as yet what this
                        would cost but we certainly couldn’t throw the common defense system out the
                        window because we had to balance the budget. Furthermore, continued
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, it <pb
                            xml:id="pg_518" n="518" facs="0548"/>seemed significant to him that
                        there was never any talk of making any drastic cuts except in defense
                        expenditures. What about cutting in other areas. Why do we continue spending
                        $2 billion annually for price supports of agriculture. I believe, concluded
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, that we might
                        quite possibly accomplish all the security objectives we have in mind and at
                        the same time succeed in bringing the budget substantially into balance. I
                        don’t know for sure and we can’t know until we have more information.</p>
                    <p>Both the President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> questioned the justice of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>’ contention that Side “B” was
                        arguing that the budget must be balanced at whatever cost to the national
                        security programs. They also pointed out that cuts and reductions had been
                        made in other areas than the national security programs. Director <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> added figures to show that there
                        was no hope of balancing the budget unless cuts were made in appropriations
                        for the national security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> remained
                        unconvinced by these arguments and insisted that paragraph 39–a proposed by
                        the Treasury and the Budget seemed to him to call for balancing the budget
                        at whatever cost, “barring basic change in the world situation.” This seemed
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> an absolute.
                        But Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        responded in defense of this paragraph by insisting that you could reach a
                        balanced budget by increasing taxes. All this paragraph argued was that you
                        must approach a balanced budget at some level—a higher if not a lower
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in any
                        case he could not accept the argument that a completely balanced budget was
                        essential under existing conditions. This was the argument of a doctrinaire
                        and indeed it was adherence to this view which had caused the
                            <persName>Hoover</persName> Administration to blow up. The facts simply
                        did not justify the conclusion that you have got to balance the budget.
                        There was still leeway.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his
                        insistence that he was not saying that the budget must be balanced come what
                        may. Rather, we were talking of a trend—the direction in which we propose to
                        go. Treasury and Budget were indeed seeking a suitable posture of defense
                        that would square with what the country could afford to pay for. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> answered that if this
                        was the view of the Budget and the Treasury it was all he could ask. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> pointed out that the
                        discussion was beginning to be confused. We were supposed to be directing
                        our thought to the first difference of opinion, namely, the nature of the
                        threat to the United States and actually the discussion had moved on to the
                        third issue, namely, how to finance United States security programs.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_519" n="519" facs="0549"/>
                    <p>The President expressed agreement and said that the issue before the Council
                        at this point was the long-term capacity of the United States to survive.
                        All of us, said the President, admit that we can endure anything for a year
                        or two and he added that this Administration had never issued any promise to
                        balance the budget in any specific year such as 1953 or 1954. Nevertheless,
                        in the long run this country must have a sound dollar. Moreover, this sound
                        dollar lies at the very basis of a sound capability for defense.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> then proposed a
                        formula which he said might produce agreement between the two sides. This
                        formula would run along the lines that we must do the maximum to meet the
                        external threat, which is possible to do without changing our way of
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed
                        agreement with Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                        >Stassen</persName>’s statement. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> did not. Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> went on to point out to the
                        President that he had “freed up” the economy of this country in the last
                        eight months. The standard of living in large parts of Europe was on the
                        upgrade. This was also the case in Japan. At the very same time that we are
                        thus strengthening and expanding these economies, we are building our
                        defenses. The way in which we now move to maximize our defense posture is
                        substantially the same way we would move if later on we have to force an
                        issue with the Soviet Union. This, said Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, was in response to the
                        President’s concern with the threat posed by Soviet possession of the
                        H-bomb.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> explained that he
                        found himself in agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> that it was very difficult to decide on this issue in
                        the absence of specific and concrete information as to the costs of an
                        adequate defense and security program. If, however, Side “A” was maintaining
                        that we need more taxes and controls in order to meet the threat posed by
                        the Soviet Union, he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>, favored Side “A’s” position, more taxes and
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, reverted to his earlier argument that Side “A” seemed
                        to assume that everything that was necessary for national defense could be
                        accomplished without grave damage to the economy. The Joint Chiefs had gone
                        even further and said that we should do what was necessary even if the
                        result was to change the American way of life. We could lick the whole
                        world, said the President, if we were willing to adopt the system of Adolph
                        Hitler. He wished, said the President, that some of the other members of the
                        Council could see the daily beating which he was taking from exponents of
                        the balanced budget and greater economy. I feel sure, said the President,
                        that I can get what we need for a period of time but if these necessities
                        are to continue over a long period, I am inclined to go along with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. The real issue
                        is how <pb xml:id="pg_520" n="520" facs="0550"/>long can we afford to do all
                        that Side “A” feels we must do to meet the threat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> expressed concern that
                        the meeting of the National Security Council was degenerating into a
                        debating society. He pointed out that the economic issues had been broken
                        down into three parts and invited the Council to return to consideration of
                        the first issue which was the statement of the nature of the threat facing
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D. Jackson</persName> then inquired
                        if he might have the floor for a moment. He expressed the opinion that both
                        sides had actually “fudged” because it was apparent that the mood of those
                        who had prepared <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 was that equal
                        weight should be assigned to adequate defense and to a balanced budget. The
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1"
                            >Jackson</persName> contended, had done better in recognizing clearly
                        that our way of life may have to be upset. As he saw it, concluded Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName>, the National
                        Security Council must decide that the defense of this nation is much more
                        important than balancing budgets or lowering taxes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> observed that while the
                        Joint Chiefs’ paper may have taken a bolder approach to the issue, their
                        paper had not done complete justice to Side “B’s” evaluation of the external
                        threat. After all, Side “B” did agree that the Soviet threat was
                        primary.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that he didn’t think anyone present here thought that
                        the cost of winning a global war against the Soviet Union was a cost too
                        high to pay. He, too, however, preferred the Joint Chiefs’ statement since
                        he doubted if we could get this so-called adequate defense over a sustained
                        period without drastically changing our whole way of life.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, speaking with
                        strong conviction, said he wanted to point out that if we ever go to the
                        American people and tell them that we are putting a balanced budget ahead of
                        national defense it would be a terrible day. What we are really trying to do
                        is to ascertain and reach a reasonable posture of defense over a long
                        period. If we can do this within a balanced budget, fine. If not, we will
                        simply have to postpone balancing the budget. We can’t balance the budget
                        over night in any case in view of what we have inherited from the previous
                        Administration, but at least we have been doing better in the last few
                        months and we can’t throw all these gains away in order to save a couple of
                        billion dollars.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was more than a couple of billion dollars. <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">Dated Jan.
                            19, <ref target="#pg_209">p. 209</ref>.</note> which had been left on
                        our doorstep by the outgoing Administration had called for additional
                        expenditures in the neighborhood of $20 billions in order to provide
                        adequately for the national <pb xml:id="pg_521" n="521" facs="0551"
                        />security. I think, said the President, that the American people ought to
                        know when and how the law of diminishing returns sets in so heavy as to
                        prove fatal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> replied that, of
                        course, he was not advocating an additional $20 billions nor defending
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 141. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that likewise no one
                        wanted to balance the budget at the sacrifice of the national security.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> interrupted to
                        say that he wished Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> would make this last statement publicly. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> went on to add
                        that while we did not propose to balance the budget by sacrificing our
                        security, we are, nevertheless, making every effort to revise and perfect
                        our defense establishment and to get it within the limits of the means
                        available to us. If all of us set out to reach this objective we can achieve
                        it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> then
                        referred to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>’s
                        comments on this subject at a previous meeting of the National Security
                        Council in which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said he had detected a genuine meeting of minds.
                        Returning to the point at issue Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said that he could not believe that it was right
                        that there should be no reference to the internal threat in a basic
                        statement of policy before page 17. The military ought to be so damned
                        dollar conscious that it hurts.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that after all we were engaged in defending a way of
                        life as well as a territory, a population, or our dollar. This being the
                        case, a recognition of this fact should comprise the first statement in the
                        policy paper. If so, all subsequent statements in the paper would reflect
                        this fundamental fact. If such a statement were included, it would be a
                        satisfactory solution of this first issue. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that such a statement
                        as the President suggested would certainly satisfy him, but Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> argued that it was
                        perfectly possible for the United States to spend more money on defense than
                        it was now spending without radically changing the American way of life and
                        provided people realize that the added expenditure is vital. In view of the
                        fact that the American standard of living had never been higher than it was
                        at the present time it was foolish to insist that we can spend no more.</p>
                    <p>The President again pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> the importance of the time element. You could get the
                        American people to make these sacrifices voluntarily for a year or for two
                        or for three years but no eloquence would sell this proposition to the
                        American people for the indefinite future.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed with
                        the President and added that you could mulct the country for five years but
                        not for twenty. Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>, addressing himself to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, asked whether we had been
                        mulcting the country or building it.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_522" n="522" facs="0552"/>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> said he
                        believed that Side “B’s” proposal should be inserted in paragraph 1. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> expressed
                        vigorous preference for the wording that the President had just suggested as
                        a solution. He warned that if the language of Side “B” were admitted into
                        the policy statement, it would presently become current throughout all the
                        departments and agencies and could have very dangerous repercussions.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> supported Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s contention and
                        pointed out that every word in these <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        policy statements is taken very literally by the staffs of the departments
                        and agencies. While we at the National Security Council level may not differ
                        fundamentally, dangerous differences could develop at the staff level to the
                        point of actually wrecking our whole security program.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General expressed the opinion that in trying to reconcile Side
                        “A” and Side “B” on this issue the Council was actually rendering a
                        disservice to the President and to the country. The President should have
                        both the statements before him and take them into consideration in making
                        decisions on concrete programs and budget problems as these were presented
                        to him for decision.</p>
                    <p>In response to this suggestion from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BROWNELLHJ1"
                            >Brownell</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> pointed out that it was essential to have an agreed
                        written statement as a guide to the departments and agencies. If we are
                        unable to resolve differences at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        level we can be certain they won’t be resolved at any other level, nor will
                        we have any real economies in the conduct of this Government.</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to paragraph 30-a and b of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 which pointed out that the basic
                        problem of national security policy was to “meet the Soviet threat to United
                        States security” and “in doing so to avoid seriously weakening the United
                        States economy or undermining our fundamental values and institutions.” Do
                        both sides, asked the President, agree with that statement of the basic
                        problem. If they do, why not substitute similar language for what now
                        appears on page 1 of the present paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> posed this question and
                        the Council agreed with the President’s suggestion. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that this solved the
                        problem as it was set forth on page 1 but that the Council must now deal
                        with the same problem as it was set forth on page 19. In short, the Council
                        should decide whether the Soviet threat had one or two aspects—external and
                        internal.</p>
                    <p>After thinking a moment, in response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>’s posing of the question, the President said he felt
                        that he had little to quarrel with in the text on the right hand side of
                        page 20 (paragraph 32–a and b).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> pointed out that the
                        members of the Council should realize that this basic statement of policy
                        would constitute a guide <pb xml:id="pg_523" n="523" facs="0553"/>to all
                        departments and agencies of the Executive Branch. Accordingly, it was
                        necessary for the report to contain adequate recognition of the economic
                        threat to the nation.</p>
                    <p>With a smile, the President turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> and said, “Joe, fundamentally you think all soldiers
                        are spendthrifts.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        then asked whether members of the Council who supported Side “A” were
                        willing to agree to accept paragraphs 32–a and 32–b on the necessity for a
                        sound and growing economy as set forth by Side “B”. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that while he had no
                        particular opposition to this proposal, he questioned whether the National
                        Security Council was the appropriate body to pass judgments on problems of
                        taxation. There was general agreement, however, to the insertion of a
                        modified version of Side “B’s” paragraph 32.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then said that the
                        Council was ready to consider the second major divergence in the paper,
                        namely, as to the effect on the economy of existing United States tax reates
                        and tax structure. He pointed out that Side “A” believed that the rates and
                        structure of the tax system <hi rend="italic">tend</hi> to restrict normal
                        incentives for long-term growth. Side “B” believed that tax rates are so
                        high and the structure of the tax system so bad that normal incentives for
                        long-term economic growth are <hi rend="italic">already seriously</hi>
                        restricted.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        explanation of this second issue, the President expressed doubt as to
                        whether the National Security Council was the appropriate body to deal with
                        this issue. When, however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> pressed for a solution of this issue, the President
                        went on to say that he would not be inclined to quarrel with the view of
                        Side “B” since, after all, the Treasury and Budget were the experts in this
                        field. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said
                        that in so far as this issue was posed in paragraph 20, he favored leaving
                        out the paragraph altogether. He felt that the paragraph had no point since
                        we cannot be said to have at the present time “normal peacetime boom
                        conditions.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> and the
                        other members of the Council agreed to the elimination of this paragraph and
                        subsequently also agreed to the elimination of the bracketed portion of
                        paragraph 23, which posed the same issue. The President commented that there
                        seemed to be some evidence that the present report had been prepared for a
                        wider audience than he hoped a Top Secret report would get. This occasioned
                        laughter, and the President went on to say that some of the exposition of
                        this problem in the paper contained redundancies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then raised the third
                        major issue in the present report, namely, how to finance United States
                        security programs. He pointed out that Side “A” believed that in meeting
                        necessary U.S. security costs and maintaining a sound U.S. economy, we <pb
                            xml:id="pg_524" n="524" facs="0554"/>must be prepared to maintain or
                        increase present tax levels; and the American people can be persuaded to
                        support such measures. Side “B”, consisting of the Treasury and the Bureau
                        of the Budget, believed that barring basic changes in the world situation,
                        the Budget should be brought into substantial balance by reducing
                        expenditures while not increasing taxes above the January 1954 levels. This
                        issue appeared in paragraphs 39–a–b and c on page 27.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> had explained the
                        reasons why Budget and Treasury believed their view more correct, the
                        President asked if anyone wanted to take on Representative Reed<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d93fn5">Representative Daniel A. Reed (R., N.Y.), Chairman of
                            the House Ways and Means Committee, 83d–84th Congresses.</note> in the
                        matter of arguing for tax increases. After the laughter had subsided,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> posed the
                        question: What is the real objective of the Administration. Was it to live
                        within our means or not. Over the long haul, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, he was convinced that we
                        must live within our means.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said he feared
                        that the language proposed by Side “B” would be interpreted as an absolute
                        commitment to balance the budget and he felt such a commitment at this time
                        to be very dangerous.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that in view of the vital importance of a sound U.S.
                        economy, it was necessary every time an expenditure was proposed to consider
                        the effect of this expenditure on the economy. Wasn’t this, he inquired, the
                        essence of the problem. If we give this view as a clear-cut directive to all
                        the staffs of Government agencies, we need not bother with philosophic
                        dissertations on the problem. With a chuckle, the President said that he now
                        seemed to be with Side “A”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> suggested
                        that he would buy Side “A’s” version of paragraph 39 if it could be revised
                        to include the phrase “over a long period of time.” It was agreed, after
                        further discussion, to accept the version of paragraphs 39–a and b as set
                        forth in Side “A’s” version but to strike subparagraph c in Side “A’s”
                        version and to put in its place as 39–c the paragraph 39–a proposed by Side
                        “B”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then explained the
                        fourth area of disagreement, namely, foreign economic assistance, pointing
                        out that Side “A” believed that U.S. economic grant aid and loans to other
                        nations of the free world should be progressively reduced only if
                        modification of U.S. trade and tariff policies permits these nations to
                        substitute trade for aid. Side “B” believed that in subsequent fiscal years
                        the United States should further curtail economic grant aid and loans to
                        other nations without conditioning such curtailment upon a <pb
                            xml:id="pg_525" n="525" facs="0555"/>modification of U.S. trade and
                        tariff policies. The President’s first comment was to point out the
                        difficulty of generalizing on this kind of a problem. The real criterion was
                        what our true interests dictated. The President went on to say that he was
                        very weary of hearing our efforts to assist other nations described as the
                        real cause of our unbalanced budget. Much of the money we had spent abroad,
                        said the President, had been very well spent indeed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> pointed out that Side
                        “B” simply did not wish to predicate any reduction of foreign economic
                        assistance on a reduction of U.S. tariffs. A mere reduction of these
                        tariffs, he insisted, would not really answer in its entirety the problem of
                        stable economies in foreign countries. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> supported the view of Side “A”
                        and suggested the omission of paragraph 35–e which Side “B” desired to
                        include. The President then invited Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> to speak to this issue.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        we might well find a number of foreign areas where an immediate increase in
                        American economic assistance would not only confer great advantage from the
                        point of view of security but would later on permit actual savings. As
                        instances, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        cited Japan and Germany. Appropriate assistance to these nations now might
                        well enable us soon to bring back U.S. divisions stationed in these
                        countries with the saving of money which would naturally follow.</p>
                    <p>Though the prevailing view seemed to favor Side “A”, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out how much he
                        disliked to leave the statements with regard to U.S. economic assistance
                        without any qualification whatsoever on the degree of this assistance. He
                        cited the loans to Brazil as an example of the danger. After further
                        discussion, in the course of which the President and the Secretary of State
                        cited the example of India and pointed out that if India collapsed, the
                        whole of Asia would unquestionably go down the drain, the Council accepted a
                        revision of paragraph 35–a which placed a limitation on further economic
                        grant aid and loans “based on the best interests of the United States.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then raised the next
                        difference of view which concerned foreign military assistance as opposed to
                        foreign economic assistance. On this issue Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out Side “A” believes
                        that military aid to Europe should be reduced only as rapidly as the
                        European economies can assume the burden of maintaining agreed adequate
                        forces. Side “B” believed that the progressive reduction of U.S. military
                        aid to Europe should not be primarily dependent upon the capability of the
                        European economies to assume this burden. The President commented with some
                        warmth that he would never agree to the progressive reduction suggested by
                        Side “B” as long as we were still desperately trying to add twelve <pb
                            xml:id="pg_526" n="526" facs="0556"/>German divisions to the defense
                        forces of Western Europe. He said he wanted General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> to make a statement as to
                        the importance of these divisions.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> replied that in
                        his view these twelve divisions were absolutely indispensable to the
                        accomplishment of our mission in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> replied that if the
                        Council adopted the view of Side “A” as set forth in paragraph 36–a, it
                        would amount to stating that we cannot reduce our military aid until these
                        nations state that they are able to carry the load. After further discussion
                        it was agreed to accept the version of paragraph 36–a proposed by Side “A”,
                        dropping out the last phrase which read “as rapidly as the United States
                        concludes that the European economies can assume this burden” and to
                        substitute therefor the phrase “as rapidly as the United States security
                        interests permit.”</p>
                    <p>The next issue, said General <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>, concerned the redeployment of U.S. forces overseas.
                        Side “A”, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        maintained that a major redeployment of U.S. forces from Europe and the Far
                        East at the present time would seriously undermine the strength of the
                        coalition. While partial redeployment might improve the United States and
                        Allied military posture, only further study can determine our most effective
                        deployment. Side “B” maintained that, because the United States and Allied
                        military posture is weakened by the present over-extended deployment of U.S.
                        forces, an early determination should be made whether, with the
                        understanding of our Allies, the redeployment toward the United States of
                        the bulk of our land and other forces should soon be initiated and carried
                        during the next few years.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> called on Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> for his views on
                        this issue, the President observed that the critical phrase in this
                        statement was the phrase “with the understanding of our Allies.”</p>
                    <p>Before Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> could
                        make his statement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had
                        reached an agreed position on this issue and that it was set forth on page 8
                        of their written memorandum in the language which, in substance, adopted the
                        position of Side “B” as contained in the righthand text of paragraph 37–a–b
                        and c of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> confirmed Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s remark by stating
                        that the Joint Chiefs were prepared to accept Side “B’s” language for
                        paragraph 37–a with only two changes. He wished to strike out the phrase
                        “reasonably soon” in subparagraph c.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that on the
                        basis of his “embryonic military knowledge” the position taken by the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff seemed sound. He felt obliged to say, however, that unless
                        this redeployment were handled with the greatest delicacy and under the <pb
                            xml:id="pg_527" n="527" facs="0557"/>cover of another and larger
                        operation, the redeployment could bring about the complete collapse of our
                        coalition in Europe. He repeated that the redeployment simply could not be
                        done as a separate and distinct move. He hoped and believed that it could be
                        done, however, as part of an “over-all operation” in Europe in which the
                        redeployment would stand out as a constructive and not a destructive step.
                        In concluding his remarks, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> indicated that this whole matter was so delicate that
                        he was fearful of even having it set forth as it was in paragraph 37–c for
                        fear that the report might leak out with terrible repercussions abroad.</p>
                    <p>The President commented philosophically that we seemed to be hoist on our own
                        petard. On the one hand we wanted our policy set forth clearly in the
                        present report. On the other we couldn’t afford to let such matters get into
                        the hands of the columnists. On the whole, continued the President, he
                        thought paragraph 37 constituted a good statement of military policy. On the
                        other hand it was vitally important that no inkling of the proposed
                        redeployment should be made public until our Allies had also been brought to
                        realize that such a redeployment was really good military policy. The
                        President went on to point out that properly speaking the stationing of U.S.
                        divisions in Europe had been at the outset an emergency measure not intended
                        to last indefinitely. Unhappily, however, the European nations have been
                        slow in building up their own military forces and had now come to expect our
                        forces to remain in Europe indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then centered on the fact that while everybody agreed with the
                        sense of paragraph c, for reasons of prudence and to avoid a leak, it was
                        thought best to omit subparagraph c. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> also said that he felt that
                        subparagraph b on the left-hand or Side “A” column of page 25 should be left
                        in since this called attention to the fact that under present conditions a
                        major withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe could be very dangerous to the
                        coalition.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        this position of the Secretary of State really went to the heart of the
                        question and to the reality of our basic intention. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> contended that the present
                        overextended deployment of our forces represented a situation which we did
                        not wish to perpetuate. Instead, we wished to redeploy these forces and if
                        we had to fight, to fight a new and not an old type of war. This particular
                        issue, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                        >Humphrey</persName>, was the guts of our whole military program. The
                        President cautioned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> by pointing out that the caveman’s rock could kill
                        his enemy if the enemy had no defense against it. Going on, the President
                        observed that if the Communists succeeded in gaining control of Europe the
                        world balance of power would be <pb xml:id="pg_528" n="528" facs="0558"
                        />hopelessly upset against us. It would be necessary to spend many more
                        billions than we are now spending to redress this balance of power. In
                        short, said the President, that Western Europe not fall to the Communists
                        was a sine qua non. Therefore, anxious as he was to see European nations do
                        more to provide for the common defense, we simply could not abandon what we
                        had begun in Europe. On the contrary, what we must do is to improve the
                        morale of Western Europe. Bringing back our divisions in any abrupt way
                        would not improve European morale but completely destroy it. Speaking with
                        great emphasis, the President pointed out that the United States divisions
                        in Europe had done marvels in restoring Europe’s faith in itself. He asked
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> to comment on
                        the points he had made.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        the Joint Chiefs were certainly in agreement on the vital importance of
                        Western Europe. On the other hand, the Joint Chiefs in considering <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 had thought of the report as a guidance
                        for a limited period of time. Obviously they thought that some of the issues
                        raised in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 were not short-term but
                        could be resolved only over a long period of time. That was true, said
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, for instance,
                        of the issues with regard to the economy and the Chiefs contended that the
                        threat to the health of the U.S. economy was part and parcel of the Soviet
                        threat. Nevertheless, he failed to see how anyone could say at the present
                        time that we are going to continue to do what we have been doing to meet the
                        Soviet threat over an indefinite future. It may be essential to find some
                        other solution to meet the threat.</p>
                    <p>The President admitted the relevance of Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>’s comment on the time issue
                        but pointed out that even as you dealt with day-to-day problems you needed
                        some kind of a philosophy as a general guide to action. Certainly, said the
                        President, we cannot continue deficit financing indefinitely and,
                        accordingly, we could not eliminate mention of the serious threat to our
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed a
                        belief that the argument in the Council on the present report had been from
                        the outset confused over long-term versus short-term measures. The President
                        said that was quite possible but that the objective in the short-term was to
                        get the United States into the posture of defense which it desired to
                        maintain over a long term.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion the Council agreed to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s solution to the redeployment
                        issue by accepting paragraph 37–a on the righthand of page 25, followed by
                        37–b on the lefthand, and followed by a new 37–c which consisted of the old
                        37–b on the right-hand side as revised. It was also agreed to leave out the
                        old 37–c for security reasons though it was to be understood that the
                        National <pb xml:id="pg_529" n="529" facs="0559"/>Security Council was
                        sympathetic to the contents of the omitted paragraph c calling for
                        redeployment over the next few years of U.S. forces under certain
                        limitations.</p>
                    <p>The Council then moved on to consider the seventh issue dealing with the
                        reduction of the Soviet threat. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> pointed out that on this issue there was a measure of
                        agreement on both sides. Both agreed that short of general war acceptable
                        negotiated settlements with the USSR are the only means of substantially
                        reducing the Soviet threat. (Side “B” believes that the possibility of such
                        settlements is more remote.) Beyond this point differences occur, said
                        General <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>. Side “A” believed
                        that the best way to induce the Soviets to accept such settlements is for
                        the United States to forego pressures at least against the USSR itself; to
                        attempt to reduce tensions on secondary issues; and to try to convince the
                        Soviet leaders that, if they renounce aggression and domination of other
                        peoples, the United States has no intention of interfering with the internal
                        organization or the territorial integrity of the USSR.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Side “B” believed that the best way of bringing the
                        Soviets to agree to such settlements is to maintain pressures against the
                        USSR which do not involve grave risk of general war. Settlements which
                        reduce tensions without a concurrent reduction of the Soviet threat could
                        lead the free world dangerously to relax its defense.</p>
                    <p>The President immediately inquired whether, under the policy advocated by
                        side “A”, .. . . Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D.
                            Jackson</persName> contended that if Side “A’s” view had prevailed we
                        could not have gone through with the food program in East Germany. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> said that the view of
                        Side “A” suggested to him continuous concessions to the USSR which the
                        record of the past had shown to be very unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that he did not mean to be too critical of any
                        honest position. If there was anyone willing to speak to paragraph 41
                        according to the version of side “A”, he would be very pleased to
                        listen.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> turned around to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BOWIERR1">Bowie</persName> and asked him if the
                        Side “A” version of paragraph 41 was the position taken by the Department of
                        State. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BOWIERR1">Bowie</persName> answered in the
                        affirmative, and the President commented, with a smile, that this was not
                        the way that the Secretary of State usually talked to him about this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                        that it might be possible to reach general agreements with the Soviets, for
                        example, on reduction of armaments, but that we were certainly not in a
                        position to impose such settlements on them. Such settlements would have to
                        be mutually acceptable. If we are prepared to grant a <hi rend="italic">quid
                            pro quo</hi> we are in a position to settle Korea and possibly even East
                        Germany. <pb xml:id="pg_530" n="530" facs="0560"/>Of course, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, his interpretation
                        of this issue by no means excluded unilateral efforts by the United States
                        to increase its relative power position vis-à-vis the USSR. Nor did his view
                        exclude efforts, together with our allies, to push our power position
                        forward against the USSR.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out the
                        relevance of this issue to the bracketed phrase in paragraph 43–a, where one
                        side said that “measures to impose pressures on the Soviet bloc should be
                        designed primarily to create conditions which would induce the Soviet
                        leadership to be more receptive to acceptable negotiated settlements”,
                        whereas the other side wanted to say “should take into account the
                        desirability of creating” such conditions.</p>
                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, the Joint Chiefs, and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, all expressed the
                        view that the bracketed subparagraph 43–c on page 31, which stated that the
                        U.S. should not initiate aggressive actions involving force against Soviet
                        bloc territory, should be omitted.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he personally would prefer to see this paragraph
                        removed, pointing out that any proposal involving the use of force against
                        such territory, whether overt or covert, would require a prior Council
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion of the content of paragraph 41, the President
                        suggested that the Council take the first sentence of paragraph 41 on the
                        left-hand side of the page, and then go on and add the subparagraphs as
                        revised.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> warned again
                        that in his view we could not reduce tensions with the USSR if in each case
                        we expected to gain all the advantage and the Soviets none. Such
                        settlements, he repeated, must be mutually acceptable, and what was being
                        proposed appeared to be reversing this Administration’s whole policy—a fact
                        that was all the more dangerous in view of Soviet possession of the
                        H-bomb.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked
                        whether the suggestion the President had just made did not meet Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>’ point. But Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> continued to insist
                        that if you subordinate the achievement of mutually acceptable settlements
                        to improving the power position of the United States as against the USSR,
                        you will eliminate all hope of settlements in Korea, Austria, Germany,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, satisfactory revisions were agreed upon in the
                        wording of paragraph 41, and it was also agreed to strike paragraph
                        43–c.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then introduced the
                        next major issue, namely, the character of measures to impose pressures on
                        the Soviets. He pointed out that Side “A” believed that measures to impose
                        pressures on the Soviet bloc should be designed primarily to create
                        conditions <pb xml:id="pg_531" n="531" facs="0561"/>which would induce the
                        Soviets to be more receptive to acceptable negotiated settlements. Side “B”,
                        on the other hand believed that measures to impose such pressures should
                        take into account the desirability of creating such conditions, but should
                        not be confined thereto.</p>
                    <p>The President at once stated his preference for the view expressed by Side
                        “B” on this issue, and there was no further discussion on it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then stated that this
                        concluded the major areas of disagreement on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162. There were, however, other points which needed to be
                        decided, and he wished the Council would agree to taking them up
                        seriatim.</p>
                    <p>Turning to page 8 of the report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said that there had been a difference in emphasis as
                        to the degree that the United States should, in the interests of its
                        leadership, meet the desires of its allies. After a brief discussion the
                        Council agreed to strike the bracketed portion of subparagraph c page 8.</p>
                    <p>The next point, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        was paragraph 3–a, on page 3, in which the issue was whether the USSR now
                        has the capability to attack the U.S. with atomic weapons, or whether the
                        USSR shortly will have this capability.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that Council action on this point involved the
                        confidence which the intelligence community in this Government had in the
                        reliability of its information. In short, this was a question of fact.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> stated the belief of the intelligence community that
                        the Russians could launch an atomic attack on the United States tomorrow if
                        they were willing to throw into this attack everything they had and take the
                        attendant risk. He did suggest, however, the removal of the adverb “very” in
                        front of “serious damage”.</p>
                    <p>The President and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> argued for the removal of the phrase “shortly will
                        have”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> thought
                        that the phrase should remain in. The President thought that this issue was
                        getting down to a quibble, and the Council agreed to remove the phrase in
                        question.</p>
                    <p>In the related statement of the problem in paragraph 31–a, page 19, the
                        Council agreed to leave the bracketed phrase, “and possibly crippling”, in
                        the text.</p>
                    <p>The next point, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        concerned the statement of the manpower problem as set forth on page 17.
                        This statement, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        had the approval of Assistant Secretary of Defense <pb xml:id="pg_532"
                            n="532" facs="0562"/>Hannah,<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">John A. Hannah,
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel.</note> but
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> had raised the
                        questions as to its validity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> then commented
                        that he thought the existing statement too pessimistic and defeatist in
                        tone. He pointed out that by Council directive the <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> was making a new study of the whole manpower situation and
                        would report to the Council on it about December 1. While he did not wish to
                        prejudge the findings of this new study, he had prepared a revision of the
                        manpower statement in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 which he
                        wished at this time to pass around to the members of the Council and to
                        comment thereon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> to comment on the
                        revision proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> felt, he said,
                        that while the present paragraph might be somewhat too pessimistic, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s substitute went
                        to the opposite extreme of being too optimistic.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that
                        he felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s
                        statement dodged the clear issue of the need or likelihood of controls over
                        manpower.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> stated that the
                        situation in the Services was pretty tight right now with regard to the
                        right kind of people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he by no
                        means denied that there were very tough manpower problems facing us, but he
                        did wish to emphasize that they were not insurmountable. He therefore
                        suggested that his language be taken as an interim statement and that the
                        Council take a new look at page 17 after the receipt of <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>’s full report on manpower.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion it was agreed to omit any statement on manpower at
                        this time, and to refer the problem to the Director of Defense Mobilization
                        and the Secretary of Defense, with the assistance of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff.</p>
                    <p>The next point, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>,
                        related to our policy with regard to the use of special weapons as set forth
                        in paragraph 38–b, with particular respect to securing the understanding and
                        approval of the use of special weapons by our allies.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that securing this approval and understanding of our
                        allies should precede the use of these special weapons, which was not the
                        case in the present text of paragraph 38–b.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, however, pointed out
                        that in their written comments the Joint Chiefs had been even firmer in
                        their insistence on the use of these weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that however that might be, nothing would so upset
                        the whole world as an announcement at this time by the United States of a
                        decision to use these weapons.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_533" n="533" facs="0563"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said he saw the
                        President’s point, but that nevertheless the Defense Department must know
                        whether or not to plan for the use of these weapons. Do we intend to use
                        weapons on which we are spending such great sums, or do we not?</p>
                    <p>The President replied that after all, he had to make the ultimate decision as
                        to the use of these weapons, and if the use of them was dictated by the
                        interests of U.S. security, he would certainly decide to use them.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                        was nevertheless still very worried about this problem. Can we, he inquired,
                        use these weapons from bases where the permission of no foreign government
                        is required? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        thought it vital that we should be able to make this decision.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated his belief that we should issue no statements on
                        this point until we have given our Government officials a chance to convince
                        our friends as to the desirability of using these weapons. So far, however,
                        as war plans were concerned, continued the President, he thought that the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> should count on making use of
                        special weapons in the event of general war. They should not, however, plan
                        to make use of these weapons in minor affairs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated his
                        often-expressed view that somehow or other we must manage to remove the
                        taboo from the use of these weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested a
                        revision of paragraph 38–b which the President said seemed suitable to him.
                        The President pointed out that there were certain places where you would not
                        be able to use these weapons because if you did it would look as though the
                        U.S. were initiating global war. If, however, we actually got into a global
                        war, we would certainly use the weapons. The President then said for a
                        second time that he was anxious to find out just what were the views of our
                        allies with respect to the use of these weapons. Would the Departments of
                        State and Defense undertake to advise him on this question?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                        he would comply with the President’s desire, but pointed out that in making
                        inquiries of our allies we must be careful to avoid framing our inquiries in
                        such language as would invite refusals or further limitations on the use of
                        these weapons.</p>
                    <p>To this the President replied that of course he expected these inquiries to
                        be handled with finesse. We needed, however, to be able to hit the Soviets,
                        if necessary, from any point on the compass.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> then stated
                        that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CHURCHILLWS1">Churchill</persName>
                        and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_ADENAUERDK1">Adenauer</persName>

                        him in great confidence <pb xml:id="pg_534" n="534" facs="0564"/>that they
                        would approve the use of the bases from which these weapons would be

                    <p>The President then remarked that it was very undesirable to knock the
                        coalition over the head by precipitate action on this issue.</p>

                    <p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the chief points
                        taken.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Concept of the National Security Council and its
                        Advisory and Subordinate Groups</p>
                    <p>The President announced at the opening of the Council meeting that he wished
                        to go over with the members of the Council his own conception of the
                        National Security Council. Two conceptions of the functions of this body, he
                        said, were prevalent. One is that each member represents his department or
                        agency and is present primarily to defend the position of that department or
                        agency. The other conception is that while you members have the staff
                        support of your agency, you come to this table as an individual in your own
                        right, not merely to represent a department. Your background helps us all to
                        reach a corporate decision and not merely a compromise of varying
                        departmental positions. What we are seeking is the best solution of our
                        problems by the corporate mind represented here.</p>
                    <p>This second conception, said the President, must apply if the National
                        Security Council is really going to work. This concept applies also to
                        advisory and supporting bodies such as the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Planning Board and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To my mind,
                        said the President, there are in each of the three military services at
                        least six individuals who would be competent to direct that service as a
                        chief of staff. But the job of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs is both distinct
                        and much more difficult. It is the task of the Joint Chiefs not merely to
                        support the three services, but to bring their consolidated wisdom and their
                        corporate experience as statesmen to solve the problems of the national
                        security. Hence, said the President, I hope that all who come here will give
                        the best they’ve got. I am convinced that a great many meetings in
                        Washington are nothing but meetings designed to achieve acceptable
                        compromises. I don’t want that view to prevail here. “We want your brains
                        and hearts, with your background.”</p>

                        should be to seek, with their background of experience, the most

                    </p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> had explained the
                        purpose of scheduling this item, the President said he wished to read to the
                        Council a statement which might be issued by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HAGERTYJC1">Hagerty</persName>, with the objective of
                        forestalling premature and misleading publicity regarding the decisions to
                        be taken on this subject at today’s Council meeting. After he had read the
                        statement the President inquired whether those present believed that its
                        issuance would be useful, and if they had any objections to the
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether
                        the statement would be issued in a formal way, and when the President said
                        that it would, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        inquired whether this would create an undesirable precedent with respect to
                        advance statements on future Council meetings. Perhaps the statement could
                        be issued more informally by word of mouth from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HAGERTYJC1">Hagerty</persName> to the press.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> remarked that
                        they thought the statement perhaps too defensive in tone. The President said
                        that there was something in this criticism, and that was one reason he had
                        brought it up. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> said,
                        however, that he thought the statement would prove useful, and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that the
                        position to take in the statement was that we were all working very hard on
                        a very difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that he and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">Jackson</persName> had worked on this
                        statement most of Saturday, and both had decided that it would be much
                        better for the President to act to forestall false statements and gossip
                        about splits in the Administration, in advance.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_537" n="537" facs="0567"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        the view that a statement should certainly be issued, but that it should be
                        divorced from any relationship to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting. Above all, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, we must not let ourselves be put into a position
                        where any subsequent revision of the budget figures which we are now
                        considering would be interpreted by the press and the public as involving a
                        blow to the national security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> commented that
                        this problem did not greatly concern him; there would be criticism in any
                        case, and the Council would have to take it. The thing to do, therefore, was
                        to decide on the best figure and stand firm against the criticism.
                        Preliminary figures, he added, were always too high.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that no one was arguing yet about figures, but that
                        we were really concerned about the effect on the public of issuing such a
                        statement as this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that the most
                        important sentence in the statement was that which referred to the
                        preliminary character of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        consideration, since the Press was already stating that the National
                        Security Council was going to decide the whole matter at today’s meeting.
                        After some slight revision of the statement, the President handed it to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAGERTYJC1">Hagerty</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> for his oral
                        presentation.</p>
                    <p>Before doing so, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> said
                        that he desired to remind everyone present of a poll that had been taken in
                        the month of July on the issues of greatest concern to the American public.
                        These had proved, in order of importance, to be as follows: (1) Korea; (2)
                        tax reduction; (3) economy in government; and (4) a balanced budget.</p>
                    <p>After this introduction, and with the use of what he described as an
                        “economy-sized” chart, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>
                        made his presentation (copy of statement in Minutes of 166th meeting).<note

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>’s conclusions were that,
                        with prospective tax adjustments and on the most optimistic basis for
                        estimating revenues for Fiscal 1955, the Administration faced a cash deficit
                        of $5.4 billion and a budgetary deficit of $8.7 billion for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955.</p>
                    <p>After a preliminary discussion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName>’s figures, the President digressed to discuss briefly
                        the differing attitudes toward the reduction in force of Government
                        personnel. He had had a recent call from a Congressman whose nearby district
                        included a large number of Government workers. This Congressman had
                        expressed great distress over the number of workers who had thus been
                        discharged, and particularly over the manner in which they had been
                        discharged. On the other hand, two members of Congress from more remote
                        areas had reported to him that the marked cut in the <pb xml:id="pg_538"
                            n="538" facs="0568"/>number of Federal workers was extremely popular in
                        their part of the country. It goes to show, said the President, how
                        different the verdict is when one got away from Washington. Personally,
                        however, the President expressed his concern over mass dismissals of loyal
                        and competent Government workers of the career sort. He felt that the
                        non-career people should be discharged first.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> suggested that the most
                        painless way to meet this problem was by the method of attrition—not
                        replacing workers who left the Government. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> continued that there was rather
                        too much of a furor over the fate of the so-called career employees.
                        Actually some of the new appointees were of much higher quality.</p>
                    <p>The President said he could not deny Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName>’s assertion, but he felt it was a great pity that
                        decent individuals who had passed creditable Civil Service examinations and
                        were in the midst of a career, should suddenly find themselves tossed out.
                        To his way of thinking, said the President, this was definitely not in
                        keeping with the best concept of the Civil Service.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                        for many of these people the jobs they held were the best that they could
                        get at the time. He furthermore saw no real difference between the treatment
                        meted out to Civil Service employees and to the employees of private
                        industry. In both cases it was necessary to maintain standards.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, insisted that he wished justice to be done, and while
                        he did not advocate keeping incompetent career workers, he wanted justice to
                        be done to the competent ones.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the
                        Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission to give the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss>’s program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 (copy
                        of the statement filed in the Minutes of the 166th meeting).</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> pointed out that
                        this program was now largely geared to filling military requirements. All
                        non-essentials have been cut back. Total expenditures would peak in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 at a figure of $2.5 billion. Unless
                        military requirements increased sharply, no extensive expansion of <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> facilities was contemplated after <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955. Emphasis would be on improvements in
                        existing plant capacity.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName>’ presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1"
                            >Dodge</persName> said that if one assumed that existing and planned
                        production capacity was necessary, the fundamental question was whether it
                        was necessary to use all this capacity at its maximum.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> replied that he
                        doubted if significant savings could be made along this line. It was
                        essential to complete the required plant, and it did not seem sensible to
                        him to leave part of it idle prior to the time that we reached the stated
                        weapons requirements.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0569"/>
                    <p>The President inquired what the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> planned
                        to do with this enormous and costly plant when weapons requirements had
                        finally been reached. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> replied that presumably <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> would have to shut it down unless you plan to use some part
                        of it for production of nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that this certainly raised a serious question.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired, if
                        the plant were shut down would it deteriorate?</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> replied that of
                        course on this point he had no criteria by which to judge, but very little
                        of the plant seemed, offhand, to be subject to depreciation. But what really
                        dictated the size and the rate of expenditures in prior years had, of
                        course, been the availability of raw materials. He also pointed out that the
                        requirements of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for weapons had risen steadily
                        since he had been connected with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>.
                        The existing stockpile of weapons was many times larger than the
                        requirements set forth by the Joint Chiefs in 1947.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> expressed the
                        view that whether you ran the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> plant or
                        not the material doesn’t depreciate. Certainly there were vast new
                        possibilities in the world for this material, and it was just as useful to
                        close down such a plant and maintain it on a stand-by basis as it was to
                        procure gold from a gold mine and store it in Ft. Knox.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> pointed out one
                        other relevant factor in the increase in weapons requirements. This was the
                        proliferation of types of weapons. The original <gloss target="#t_A1"
                            >A</gloss>-bomb had now been developed into a multipurpose weapon.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> reminded Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> that in the course
                        of his presentation he had referred to the fact that he was “starving
                        research”, a statement which greatly disturbed Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> said that he had
                        used this phrase in order to avoid undergoing further cuts in this important
                        field. In point of fact, he meant, in starving research, that he had held
                        the funds devoted to research to the previous figure despite much enlarged
                        facilities and some very promising developments in certain research areas
                        which might produce significant technological breakthroughs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                        from the standpoint of the prestige of the United States perhaps our
                        greatest single asset was ability to keep ahead of the Soviet Union in the
                        scientific and technological field. If we were to lose this advantage, it
                        would be a grave blow to the security and to the leadership of the United
                        States. He would much prefer, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, to see research and <pb
                            xml:id="pg_540" n="540" facs="0570"/>development pushed to the limit, as
                        against adding to an already large stockpile of weapons.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> was of the opinion that we had about all the good
                        scientists who were available at work on these various <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and Defense projects. He doubted whether
                        the expenditure of more money would produce a significantly larger number of
                        good scientists.</p>
                    <p>On these issues Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>
                        said he may have given a false impression with the phrase “starving
                        research”. He did not mean that he was proposing to fire scientists or to
                        fail to do the things in this field which we ought to do. He did propose,
                        however, to cut down on equipment.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        the view that whether in private industry or in the Government, there was no
                        way that you could spend money faster than on research, and unless this
                        research was very carefully scrutinized, the results were often not worth
                        the expenditure.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to the relative costs of research and of
                        development in this field, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> replied that $150 million was allotted to basic
                        research in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> pointed out, in
                        answer to the President’s query, that research and development involved,
                        first, basic research, then applied research, whereas development pertained
                        to the construction of devices of which it was uncertain whether or not they
                        would actually work until tested. That, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, was the definition of research
                        and development.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether
                        Intelligence could give us any idea of what the Soviets were spending in
                        this field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that
                        this was not an easy question to answer, but that Intelligence estimated
                        that the curve of the Soviet figure would cross ours in about two years’
                        time. At the very least, we knew that a terrific effort was being made by
                        the USSR in this field.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that it seemed inexplicable to him that with their
                        comparatively few institutions the Soviets were able to turn out such large
                        numbers of scientists and technicians, while we were scarcely able to
                        increase our own output.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        in a totalitarian state it was always possible to compel people to become
                        scientists if they had aptitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> pointed out that
                        furthermore in the Soviet Union scientific research experienced no
                        competition from private enterprise. The President still seemed unconvinced
                        by these explanations.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0571"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> whether the
                        latter had not reported at an earlier Council meeting that there are now
                        actually more scientific students in the USSR than in the United States. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that he
                        had not said that this situation existed now, but it soon would, and the
                        President reiterated his incomprehension of how the Soviets could accomplish
                        such things while we insist that we cannot.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> to give his
                        presentation of the mutual security program.</p>
                    <p>Before speaking, Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> passed out memoranda of his oral remarks (copy filed
                        in the Minutes of the 166th meeting).</p>
                    <p>After a discussion of Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>’s figures, particularly by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the President inquired
                        whether deliveries of matériel to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        would now be stepped up since hostilies in Korea had been concluded.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> answered that
                        of course it was possible to do this, but it would depend now chiefly on the
                        ability of these countries to absorb and use this additional matériel.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> to give him a memorandum on the ammunition situation
                        in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. When he was last
                        there, said the President, the ammunition supply was very precarious and
                        constituted one of the weak points in our armor.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said he had the
                        figures available, and would get them to the President at once. The
                        President said that according to his recollection we figured on ninety days’
                        supply of ammunition for our forces. The figure was much less for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the
                        Secretary of Defense for his oral presentation of the Defense Department
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                        the biggest proportion of expenditure for the national security fell in the
                        Department of Defense. He therefore wanted to go back and review the problem
                        as it had developed since last spring. At that time, he pointed out, the
                        Council had laid great emphasis on the formulation of a new strategic
                        concept. To illustrate this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> then read the memorandum sent to him by the President
                        in July, requesting the new Joint Chiefs to report, independently of their
                        staffs, as to the possibility of a new concept and real savings in military
                        expenditure. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        then referred to the reply which the Joint Chiefs had made to the
                        President’s request, which they had sent to him on August 8,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d94fn5">Not found.</note> and read the conclusions and
                        recommendations of this report.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_542" n="542" facs="0572"/>
                    <p>Thereafter, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                        >Wilson</persName>, on September 16 he had written a memorandum to the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff as to their part in the preparation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 Defense budget.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d94fn6">Not found.</note> This memorandum, which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> read, called for
                        preliminary returns from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to assist in the
                        preparation of the detailed budget of the Department of Defense. On October
                        2, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>,
                        the Joint Chiefs had presented their response to his own memorandum of
                        September 16.<note n="6" target="d94fn6">Not found.</note> They had
                        presented the force levels for the major combat forces. They had not had
                        time, however, to pass judgement on the composition of the support forces.
                        Furthermore, they had also pointed out that in view of the fact that there
                        had been no significant change in basic national security policy, no change
                        in the seriousness of the Soviet threat, and no clear decision on the use of
                        atomic weapons, they had not felt it possible to make significant changes in
                        the level of the combat forces.</p>
                    <p>The President interrupted to inquire whether it was felt necessary to state
                        the final Air Force goal now (137 wings) in order to plan for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and 1957.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then said his
                        next item was his own letter to Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName>, summarizing the findings of
                        the Joint Chiefs’ report to him. For planning purposes, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, he had approved
                        using the force levels with regard to the supporting elements, the Reserve,
                        and the National Guard units, as set forth by the individual military
                        services, despite the fact that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not approved
                        these levels for the support forces.</p>
                    <p>With this introduction, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>, he would now call upon Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> to comment on the preliminary
                        cost estimates for the Defense Department budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> again emphasized that
                        his figures constituted only a rough order of magnitude, since the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had approved only the levels for the major
                        combat forces but not the support elements, which constituted approximately
                        half the total cost of the armed forces. Despite this, he had attempted to
                        price out the cost of the total forces to be maintained in the Defense
                        Department budget.</p>
                    <p>After indicating the major assumptions on which he had done his costing, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> came up with a total
                        cost of approximately $43 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1955. Since, he added, there would be some overlap between the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and the Defense military assistance
                        figures, say approximately $1 billion, this amount could be deducted from
                        the total figure.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_543" n="543" facs="0573"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> complained that the
                        Defense estimates had not taken into consideration savings which might be
                        realized from the termination of the Korean war, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> replied that the manner in
                        which the war had terminated had not permitted as great reductions as had
                        been hoped for.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        when all was said and done, the Defense Department was going to spend $48
                        billion in the present fiscal year and $47 billion in the next fiscal year,
                        with all the savings coming out of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>. As far as the Defense
                        Department itself was concerned, the figures presented by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> offered no cut at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out again that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName>’s figure included
                        unilateral service estimates on the size and cost of the support forces.
                        Since they amounted to approximately half the total cost, the figure of
                        approximately $43 billion had as of now no real validity.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> took exception
                        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s comment, and said
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName>’s report was
                        better guidance than that. He again stated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        had strongly emphasized that there had been no change in United States
                        commitments and no change with respect to our policy on the use of atomic
                        weapons. The Council must therefore attempt to clarify promptly its views on
                        the use of atomic weapons. The next thing was to try to see what could be
                        done to initiate changes in the deployment of our forces overseas. Such
                        changes could be forecast in the Defense Department’s budget picture.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then read a
                        memorandum which he had written on this point to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        and to the Service Secretaries. This memorandum suggested a complete new
                        survey designed to provide the United States with a defense posture which
                        would give us reasonable security (1) without causing financial and economic
                        unrest at home, (2) without raising fear abroad that we were proposing to
                        unleash global war, and (3) without raising apprehensions among our allies
                        that we were withdrawing from the arena. The memorandum instructed the Joint
                        Chiefs to do this on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        report of August 8 and of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162.<note
                            n="7" xml:id="d94fn7">Dated Sept. 30, <ref target="#pg_489">p.
                            489</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Turning to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, the
                        President inquired, can I sum up your position in this way: You believe that
                        there should be a readjustment of U.S. military strength which would
                        maximize our striking and retaliatory power, but you have encountered
                        obstacles in trying to accomplish this readjustment. The State Department is
                        worried about the effects of any large-scale redeployment. Accordingly, you
                        feel that you must take a more cautious approach to a <pb xml:id="pg_544"
                            n="544" facs="0574"/>major redeployment program. If, continued the
                        President, this is an accurate summary of your position, I think you should
                        do the following things. First, take another hard look at the major combat
                        forces, with particular respect to the time factor. If we could take the
                        same approach to military production that we do to public works, roads,
                        schools, etc., it would be very helpful. In other words, you put the heat on
                        this production when we face an economic depression and you take off the
                        heat when the economy is going at full tilt.</p>
                    <p>Second, continued the President, and dealing with the military situation
                        alone, the utmost that we can hope to achieve is, in Washington’s words, a
                        respectable posture of defense. We cannot hope for a perfect defense.
                        Accordingly, can we not stretch out more? Do we need everything for our
                        armed forces right now? The thing to do is constantly to bear in mind a
                        defense posture related to the long pull.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly and finally, said the President, I am afraid that the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff are just going to have to work their heads off to produce estimates of
                        the size of the support forces. You are not going to get away, as my
                        military advisers, with confining your recommendations to major combat
                        forces only, and you should look hard as to the possibility of cuts in these
                        support forces. Let’s not calculate, when we are trying to think of our
                        defense over the long term, that we need to maintain everything—all the
                        ships at sea— at a hundred percent of their complements. What I’d like to
                        see is a complete and thorough re-examination by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        of this whole problem, in which they would really take a corporate view, and
                        see how far they could get. After all, said the President, we must depend on
                        you people to provide us with your estimate of what can be done on a truly
                        austere basis all the way down the line. Can we put off this or that
                        desirable expenditure for a year, or two years, or longer?</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied to the
                        President by pointing out that they were now talking about an interim budget
                        pending a more detailed review later on. He said that the Joint Chiefs were
                        confident that considerable reductions could be made in the military
                        services’ estimates of the size and cost of the support elements. It had not
                        been possible to review these levels and costs because it had been necessary
                        to meet today’s deadline. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs had had to carry on
                        along the lines of budgeting programs which had gone into effect last
                        spring.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that what disturbed him most in this exposition was
                        the estimate of an increase in the total force level for the armed services
                        up to 3.5 million. Not only was this an increase over present levels, said
                        the President, but we ought rather <pb xml:id="pg_545" n="545" facs="0575"
                        />to be trying to reduce present levels to 3 million. The President
                        emphasized that he did not wish to see this cut made in combat units but
                        everywhere else in the military establishment, once again on the basis of a
                        respectable as opposed to a perfect posture of defense.</p>
                    <p>When the President had concluded, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> whether the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimates of force
                        levels reflected recent Council discussions with respect to the availability
                        and use of new weapons.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                        they did not, and the President pointed out that such weapons could
                        certainly be used by the United States if it were attacked. Otherwise it was
                        necessary to get the understanding and approval of our allies for the use of
                        these weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then read to the
                        Council the statement with regard to the use of atomic weapons set forth in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162 as revised, and the President
                        expressed approval of this language.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> again turned to
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> and explained
                        what he had meant by his first question. The President, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, had made it clear in
                        his memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> last July <note n="8" xml:id="d94fn8">Not
                            found.</note> that he wanted the new Joint Chiefs of Staff to conduct a
                        basic review of U.S. military strategy. Had such a review been made,
                        inquired Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, and
                        was it or was it not reflected in the present recommendations of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff?</p>
                    <p>To this question Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> replied that the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not feel
                        that they had been given sufficiently clear definitions of policy to enable
                        them in consequence to outline a really significant change in the existing
                        composition of our military forces.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that there
                        were at least two basic questions which the Council must answer before the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff could come up with a “new look” at our military
                        strategy. First, to what degree do we start to change our basic national
                        security policy? Secondly, to what degree can we shift emphasis from
                        conventional to atomic weapons? If no answers are provided to these
                        questions, and if we can’t as a result considerably reduce our levels of
                        military personnel, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> predicted it would be very tough to make any real
                        progress toward achieving lower defense costs. It was going to be very hard
                        to get down from a level of 3.5 million to 3 million men and still maintain
                        reasonable security for our country. Nevertheless, we would try.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then informed the
                        Council that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        had just advised him that the statement in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162 on the use of <pb xml:id="pg_546" n="546" facs="0576"
                        />atomic weapons was regarded by the Joint Chiefs as insufficient guidance
                        to enable them to effect any real change.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he disagreed with the Joint Chiefs, and stated
                        again that the only war that the United States was really scared of was a
                        war initiated by the enemy against us. In this contingency we could always
                        use atomic weapons from our own bases, but there was question about their
                        use from bases in foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the President, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> immediately asked whether the Joint Chiefs could
                        plan on the use of atomic weapons in Korea in case of a resumption of
                        hostilities. He insisted that the language in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162 did not give a clear answer to this question.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> that, after
                        all, we are the UN Command in Korea, and of course we could use these
                        weapons if military considerations dictated their use. Though, he added, it
                        would be useful if he could have a little time to prepare our sixteen allies
                        in the Korean war for the use of these weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President raised the question whether the use of atomic weapons in this
                        contingency in Korea would cause a dangerous breach in allied solidarity. He
                        believed, he added, that we should use the bomb in Korea if the aggression
                        is renewed, but he would like a check on any agreements into which we might
                        have entered with our allies respecting the use of these weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that his
                        people ought to get together with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> and carefully define the areas in which you could
                        count on being able to use atomic weapons, and thereafter calculate the
                        resultant cut in defense costs. He remarked that he was going to be in
                        London this next week and would be having conversations with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDENSA1">Eden</persName> and Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHURCHILLWS1">Churchill</persName>. Wouldn’t it, he
                        inquired, be useful to try to get the decks cleared on this atomic matter
                        during these conversations?</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                        would be glad to supply the Secretary of State with a memorandum on this
                        subject from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="9" xml:id="d94fn9">This
                            proposed memorandum cannot be identified with certainty. However, both
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council were engaged
                            at this time in reviewing <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 151,

                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> also provide a
                        clear text for the statement on atomic weapons presently contained in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, said no, that we could not hope to do better than the
                        presently agreed language on this point.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                        thought it absolutely essential to settle this issue of the use of atomic
                        weapons. Only their use on a broad scale could really change the program of
                        the Defense Department and cut the costs of the military budget.</p>
                    <p>Expressing agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> commented that unless we
                        could use these weapons in a blanket way, no possibility existed of
                        significantly changing the present composition of our armed forces.</p>
                    <p>With some heat, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> pointed out to the Council that <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> critical
                        year. We are, of course, all dealing with imponderables, but we must
                        preserve public confidence in the soundness of the economy and in the
                        leadership of the President. If people begin to think that this
                        Administration is conducting its business in the same old way as the last,
                        the American economy will go to hell and the Republican Party will lose the
                        next election. If Ike’s budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955
                        doesn’t go to Congress with at least a cash balance, there will be terrific
                        repercussions in the Congress and among the people. He thought, therefore,
                        that this <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 budget was the key to the
                        whole situation.</p>
                    <p>Supporting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> pointed out that this
                        figure of $43 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 amounted to
                        a reduction of only $2.5 billion from what President <persName
                            corresp="#p_TRUMANHS1">Truman</persName> had forecast for this year in
                        his last budget.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        pointed out that of course costs had increased because of inflation.
                        Furthermore, it was vital and costly to improve continental defense. We also
                        now knew that the Russians could make <gloss target="#t_H1">H</gloss>-bombs.
                        Whatever Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        thought, we have got to be able to tell the American people that we are
                        doing something to confront the threat posed by these developments to their
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, referring to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s plea for
                        a balanced budget, pointed out with great emphasis that if you do proceed
                        with a balanced budget in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955, the cuts
                        which would enable the achieving of the balance would all be made in the
                        area of foreign assistance in Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>’s province. This, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, would constitute the worst
                        kind of false economy.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he agreed with this judgment of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, and said that if he could be
                        convinced that we need all this money he was prepared to fight for it
                        everywhere and with all the energy he could summon up, although he said he
                        did not want <pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0578"/>to scare the people to
                        death and did want our military posture to be calculated on a long-term
                        basis. We ought to realize, he said, that our military people could not
                        possibly redeploy the forces that we are talking about in a single year.
                        What we could do was to think and plan for such a redeployment, and
                        meanwhile calculate everything else on the most austere basis possible.</p>
                    <p>Discussion then shifted to the desirability of the Defense Department
                        producing firmer estimates with respect to force levels and costs at the
                        meeting of the National Security Council scheduled for October 29. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> pointed out the
                        difficulty of dealing with the levels and costs of the support forces in so
                        short a time, while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        insisted that compliance with the October 29 date was almost essential if
                        the budget was to be got ready in time for presentation to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then stated that
                        when we finally put the Defense Department budget in, we should be content
                        with an over-all figure and not try to break this figure down until next
                        spring, when we would be obliged to. He again insisted that the Defense
                        Department was not ready yet to produce a detailed breakdown of its
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that this matter be taken up by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName>. The latter observed that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s proposed
                        procedure might be OK if you had a lower total figure, but it would never do
                        with a figure of $43 billion.</p>
                    <p>In view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s
                        dilemma, the President asked him whether he could do part of the job by
                        October 29 and present the Council with what would amount to another interim
                        report of progress on October 29.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked why
                        the Defense Department could not now begin to proceed on the assumption that
                        they could make use of atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President turned on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and said, let me ask you a question. Just how many
                        troops do you think it possible for us to get out of Europe in 1955? The
                        presence of our troops there is the greatest single morale factor in Europe.
                        You cannot therefore make a radical change so quickly. Besides, the physical
                        cost of bringing back these troops will be so high as to effect very little
                        savings in the course of next year, even if considerable numbers were to be
                        redeployed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> added that the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated that it would take two years to effect a
                        major redeployment of our forces overseas, that the operation would be very
                        expensive, and that no savings could be contemplated until the men were
                        actually at home.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_549" n="549" facs="0579"/>
                    <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> was right, but that nevertheless the Joint Chiefs
                        could start right now on computing force levels on a genuine austerity
                        basis, pointing out that he did not want cuts in combat strength, but rather
                        in the support forces and other such personnel.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>This matter is, of course, one of the greatest delicacy and I had understood,
                        in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Decision of August
                        27, 1953,<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">For the memorandum of discussion at the

                        entrusted to me. In the exercise of this responsibility, I had come to the

                            >Radford</persName>, that nothing of this sort could be done at this

                    <p>Even the idea that we are considering at this time a curtailment of these
                        forces would be effectively used by the opponents of <gloss target="#t_EDC1"

                    <p>I strongly urge that the great delicacy of this matter should be realized and
                        that no impression should be allowed to get about that we may be thinking of
                        pulling troops out of Europe.</p>
                    <p>If any rumors to that effect come to the attention of any responsible
                        officials, I hope they will be denied.</p>

                        affect the world situation through 1955 rather than with the specific events
                        and conditions which will characterize that situation. The estimate must
                        assume a continuation of present US policies and thus cannot consider the

                        situation.</p>

                    <p>1. Despite the change in regime in the USSR and the shifts in Soviet foreign
                        and domestic tactics, there has been no change in the USSR’s basic hostility
                        to all non-Soviet power. The USSR will continue its cold war against the
                        Free World, largely through a vigorous political warfare campaign. While
                        East-West negotiations are possible, there is little likelihood of any major
                        Soviet concessions.</p>
                    <p>2. On the other hand, we believe that deliberate initiation of general war by
                        the USSR is unlikely during this period,<note n="*" xml:id="d96fn-sym1">
                            <p>The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, considers that
                                the intelligence available is insufficient to permit a judgment, of
                                Soviet capabilities or intentions, sufficiently accurate to justify
                                the conclusion that:</p>
                            <p>“Deliberate initiation of general war by the USSR is unlikely during
                                this period.” [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        </note> and, to the extent that the USSR pursues a more cautious policy, the
                        chance of war by miscalculation will also probably be less. However, there
                        will be continuing danger that it may occur from a series of actions <pb
                            xml:id="pg_552" n="552" facs="0582"/>and counteractions initiated by
                        either side, but not intended by either side to have that result. In
                        particular it might arise from actions by one side that were regarded by the
                        other as an imminent threat to its security. There will also be a continued
                        danger of new or intensified East-West clashes, particularly in Indochina,
                        and Korea, and of incidents in Germany.</p>
                    <p>3. In the absence of such East-West clashes, and unless the USSR abandons its
                        ostensibly conciliatory tactics, the next two years will probably be a
                        period of reduced Free World apprehensions of general war. So long as this
                        period lasts it will present a new challenge to the Free World. While over
                        the longer run the very diversity of the Free World may lend it a
                        flexibility and potential for growth which will constitute a source of
                        strength, over the next two years this diversity may prove a source of
                        weakness. The totalitarian nature and centralized controls of the Soviet
                        Bloc might give it advantages in this phase of the cold war, even though the
                        totalitarian rigidities of the Bloc system might over the longer run impair
                        its stability and cohesion. Continued stresses and strains within the Soviet
                        Bloc are likely, but the monolithic unity and forced cohesion of the Bloc
                        will probably be much less affected by a situation of reduced apprehensions
                        than the more divided Free World. Moreover, the build-up of Bloc strength
                        will almost certainly continue, even if at a somewhat reduced rate, while
                        the Free World may be inclined to relax its guard. We believe that in a
                        situation of reduced international apprehensions and Bloc emphasis on
                        divisive tactics, there is danger of a weakening in the unity of the Free
                        World.</p>
                    <p>4. The progress being made by the USSR in the development of nuclear weapons
                        is also a factor of prime military and psychological importance in the world
                        situation. As this Soviet capability increases, Western superiority in
                        numbers of nuclear weapons will be of relatively less significance so far as
                        the psychological factor is concerned. As the USSR increases its
                        capabilities for delivering a seriously damaging attack on the US, the US is
                        losing the unique position it has held in the East-West struggle. The full
                        impact of this development is not yet clear, but even now we perceive two
                        new elements:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. One is the danger that the USSR may use threats of atomic
                            bombardment against certain Free World countries in an attempt to force
                            their compliance with its demands. There is a chance that some US
                            allies, if they feared that the threat of US retaliation would not deter
                            Soviet action, would be forced by the prospect of atomic devastation to
                            adopt more neutral positions in a cold, or especially in a hot,
                            war.</item>
                        <item>b. In an age where initial air assault can be so destructive, the US
                            is losing, if it has not already lost, the immense advantages of <pb
                                xml:id="pg_553" n="553" facs="0583"/>being able to conduct a
                            deliberate and extensive post D-day mobilization with relative freedom
                            from enemy attack.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Trends in Soviet Bloc Cohesion, Strength,
                        and Policies</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Cohesion of the Bloc.</hi> Despite the possibility of a
                        disruptive struggle for power within the new Kremlin leadership and the
                        evidence of popular disaffection within the Satellites, we believe the Bloc
                        will preserve its cohesion through the period of this estimate, and that the
                        Kremlin will continue to play the dominant role in the formulation of Bloc
                        policies. We believe that the USSR and Communist China will remain closely
                        allied during the period of this estimate.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Bloc Capabilities.</hi> The build-up of Bloc basic
                        industry and military capabilities will continue even though increased
                        attention will be devoted to the correction of certain economic deficiencies
                        in agriculture and consumer industries which recently have been specially
                        emphasized. There are indications that the Soviet authorities intend to
                        proceed along the lines laid out in the announced plans for these sectors of
                        the economy. This would require an allocation of greater resources to
                        agricultural and consumer goods production and, at least for the short run,
                        would lead to a reduction in the rate of expansion of other sectors of the
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>7. The most significant increase in Bloc military capabilities during the
                        period of this estimate will arise from enlargement of the Bloc stockpile of
                        nuclear weapons (and the addition of a thermonuclear component), and from an
                        increase in the number of its jet aircraft and its submarines. The Bloc may
                        by mid-1955 have available a sufficient number of heavy bombers to increase
                        greatly its long-range air offensive capabilities. The Bloc will probably
                        increase its air defense capabilities, and may have a limited number of
                        all-weather jet interceptors in operational units. We do not believe that
                        marked changes in Bloc military strength and capabilities are likely to
                        occur in other respects; however, there will be a general improvement in
                        training and equipment of Bloc armed forces.</p>
                    <p>8. Bloc political warfare capabilities, through exploitation of Western
                        political and economic vulnerabilities, encouragement of anti-Westernism and
                        nationalism in underdeveloped countries, and utilization of the world-wide
                        network of Communist parties, will remain great.</p>

                        Their basic objectives, therefore, continue to be an expansion of their own
                        sphere of power and the eventual domination of the non-Communist world.</p>
                    <p>10. We believe that during the period of this estimate Bloc leaders will try
                        to avoid courses of action which in their judgment might involve substantial
                        risk of general war. We also believe it unlikely that the Bloc will initiate
                        new local aggressions with identifiable Bloc forces during the period of
                        this estimate, since the Communist leaders probably estimate that virtually
                        any new local military aggression would now entail substantial risk of
                        general war or political consequences adverse to Bloc interests.</p>
                    <p>11. It is always possible, of course, that the Kremlin will deem some act of
                        local armed aggression sufficiently advantageous to make the risk worth
                        while. Moreover, despite its reluctance to run substantial risks of general
                        war, the Kremlin might through miscalculation adopt some course of action
                        involving such a risk. We also believe that the Kremlin would not be
                        deterred by the risk of general war from taking counteraction against a
                        Western action which it considered to present an imminent threat to Bloc
                        security.</p>
                    <p>12. During the period of this estimate the Communist leaders will conduct a
                        vigorous political warfare campaign to undermine the Western power position.
                        At present the Kremlin seems to be trying to give the impression that it has
                        adopted a more conciliatory policy than that followed in <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName>’s later years. The Kremlin may
                        hope by such tactics to relax the vigilance of some Western states, to
                        encourage dissension between the US and its allies, and to delay the
                        progress of Western rearmament. We cannot predict how long such
                        comparatively conciliatory tactics will continue; we believe that harsh
                        courses of action similar to those pursued by the Kremlin in the past will
                        reappear whenever the Kremlin deems them advantageous.</p>
                    <p>13. We believe that Bloc leaders during the period of this estimate will
                        probably be prepared to reach an accommodation on some minor questions, and
                        may make plausible but unacceptable proposals on major matters. However,
                        they will almost certainly be unwilling to settle any East-West differences
                        at the cost of major concessions. We believe, moreover, that the Bloc
                        leaders will be extremely cautious in pursuing conciliatory tactics, and may
                        revert from time to time to demonstrations of toughness, especially when
                        they consider that their vital interests are involved, or that their tactics
                        are being construed abroad as a sign of weakness. Offers to negotiate may be
                        accompanied by reminders that the USSR now has improved capabilities in the
                        nuclear weapons field, and as these capabilities further increase, the
                        Kremlin may become bolder in its dealings with the West.</p>

                    <p>14. There are recent indications that the Bloc intends to increase its trade
                        with non-Communist states. The Bloc’s volume of trade with the Free World
                        will probably increase somewhat during the period of this estimate, but this
                        trade will continue to be very small in proportion to intra-Bloc trade. New
                        trade agreements will probably be intended not only to obtain desired
                        imports but also to weaken the economic ties of non-Communist states with
                        the US, and to make strategic trade controls a bone of contention between
                        these states and the US. While the Bloc will not be able to bring about a
                        major shift in present trade patterns, the Communists probably estimate that
                        political dividends can be earned from even small increases in their current
                        volumes of trade with individual non-Communist states.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Developments in the Free World</p>
                    <p>15. During the next two years the Free World will have difficulty in
                        maintaining its strength in the face of Soviet divisive tactics and probable
                        reduced apprehensions of East-West conflict. In contrast to the Kremlin’s
                        ability to control or influence the close-knit Soviet Bloc, the US, as
                        leader of the anti-Soviet powers, faces the complex problems of dealing with
                        the loose anti-Soviet coalition and the agglomeration of other nations of
                        varying neutral tendencies which together make up the Free World. To many of
                        this latter group, particularly the Middle and Far Eastern countries, the
                        East-West struggle seems less important than the solution of their internal
                        problems and the assertion of their independence of the chief Western
                        Powers.</p>
                    <p>16. Differing views also exist between the US and its allies over the
                        imminence of the Communist threat. The very fact of Communist aggression in
                        Korea increased fears of general war and was a prime factor in stimulating
                        Western rearmament. Now that many Free World countries believe that the
                        threat of war has been reduced by a Korean armistice and by an ostensibly
                        more conciliatory Soviet policy, the US will have greater difficulty holding
                        together an anti-Soviet coalition and in securing increased Free World armed
                        strength. The levelling off of the US’s own rearmament effort and the
                        decline in many of its foreign aid programs also lessens the sense of
                        urgency abroad.</p>
                    <p>17. The apparent decline of Free World confidence in US leadership is another
                        problem facing the US. Influential groups in many Free World countries,
                        including several US allies, doubt the stability, moderation, and maturity
                        of US policy. On the one hand, there is fear the US will shift to a
                        “go-it-alone” policy or even retreat to isolationism, on the other that the
                        US will involve the Free World in war. These doubts and fears offer a
                        fertile field for Soviet divisive <pb xml:id="pg_556" n="556" facs="0586"
                        />tactics, and the new Soviet regime may be more successful than <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> in exploiting them.</p>
                    <p>18. In a situation in which many Free World countries believe that the threat
                        of war has been reduced, economic problems will also assume greater
                        prominence and will test the strength and cohesion of the Free World. This
                        reduced apprehension will weaken what has been a powerful incentive to
                        cooperation and sacrifice. Moreover, some readjustment to a reduced rate of
                        rearmament and declining US aid will be necessary. Much will depend on US
                        economic policies and the US economic situation. Not only would US economic
                        setbacks have a serious impact on the Free World, but US trade policy will
                        directly affect the economic health of Free World countries, and US aid will
                        remain in many cases an important element in their military build-up,
                        economic stability and development, and political orientation. The problem
                        of East-West trade is also likely to become more troublesome.</p>
                    <p>19. Therefore, we believe that in the absence of renewed Soviet provocation,
                        there may develop further serious rifts between the Free World nations which
                        will weaken the Western position in the cold war. Such rifts may develop in
                        any case as a result of economic developments or local nationalist pressures
                        but reduced apprehensions of war, combined with skillful Soviet divisive
                        efforts, would make them even more serious. The most troublesome differences
                        may arise over policies to be pursued in the Far East. It is possible,
                        therefore, that the next few years might see an increasing isolation of the
                        US, not by its own desire but because of increasing policy differences
                        between it and other countries of the Free World.</p>
                    <p>20. Even assuming the continuation of the Soviet courses of action projected
                        in paragraphs 9–14 above, there remains a serious danger of new or widening
                        East-West clashes in such critical areas as Indochina, Korea, and Germany,
                        which would again increase Free World apprehensions. Whether, if such
                        clashes took place, the Free World would then rally to the support of the US
                        and of expanded rearmament programs, as after the Korean aggression, would
                        probably depend at least in part on the circumstances under which the
                        clashes developed.</p>

                    <p>21. Although we foresee no developments which will undermine the basic

                        that, in view of reduced European apprehensions of East-West conflict, rifts
                        may develop between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners,
                        particularly between the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries and the US. The USSR will attempt to undermine <pb xml:id="pg_557"
                            n="557" facs="0587"/>popular support for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> alliance and for rearmament, in particular the program to
                        rearm West Germany. These efforts, together with increased Soviet nuclear
                        capabilities, continued intra-European differences, and European
                        disagreements with the US over cold war policies, may lead to more
                        nationalist and neutralist attitudes in Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>22. So long as apprehensions remain reduced there also will almost certainly
                        be a further loss of momentum in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        build-up. The general feeling that the immediate Soviet threat has receded
                        has already led most <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to
                        reduce their military outlays. While a further slow increase in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strength over the next two years is
                        probable, only in event of renewed Soviet aggressiveness will it be as rapid
                        as in 1950–1953. On the other hand this might allow many <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to concentrate on domestic
                        needs and to devote more resources to meeting their own social and economic
                        problems. Such a trend might strengthen countries such as the <gloss

                        international economic developments.</p>
                    <p>23. Significant increases in European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        military strength over the coming period will probably depend upon the
                        extent to which Spain, Yugoslavia, and above all West Germany can be

                        >NATO</gloss>. The Trieste issue will remain an irritant in Italo-Yugoslav

                        increasingly around the interlocking problems of Germany’s future and the
                        attitude of France. As a result of Soviet failure to come forward with any

                            >Adenauer</persName>’s overwhelming victory, the chances for integrating

                        increased. <note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">For documentation on efforts to

                        postpone these developments by renewed talk of German reunification, but it
                        is unlikely to offer any terms which would jeopardize its control over East
                        Germany. <persName corresp="#p_ADENAUERDK1">Adenauer</persName>’s position
                        is so strong and German disillusionment with Soviet unification offers is so
                        great that any Soviet offers not involving abandonment of Soviet control
                        over East Germany would be unlikely to have much impact on German opinion.
                        The importance attached by the Soviet rulers to West German rearmament is
                        such, however, that they might react to it by measures which would enhance
                        the <pb xml:id="pg_558" n="558" facs="0588"/>risk of an East-West clash in
                        this area. A likely pressure point would be West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>25. Other difficulties will be created by the weakness and hesitations of
                        France. A strong West Germany and a strong France are both necessary for the
                        creation of a strong and stable Western Europe; French weaknesses and
                        indecision are blocking the achievement of this objective. France is
                        over-extended internationally, hampered by outmoded political and economic
                        institutions, and still torn by domestic, economic, and social difficulties.
                        France fears a strong West Germany which might dominate it or drag it into
                        war. Moreover, there are indications that the USSR, in its efforts to
                        forestall West German rearmament, may concentrate on France as the most
                        vulnerable point in the Western coalition.</p>
                    <p>26. Though many in France are aware of the need for strong government, there
                        is no evidence that this awareness will lead to a stronger French political
                        system. The social cleavages, economic problems, and political weaknesses of
                        France will remain as serious obstacles to the building of a strong and
                        stable Europe. A successful resolution of the Saar issue, now made more
                        likely by reason of the <persName corresp="#p_ADENAUERDK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName> victory in West Germany, may well prove the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Trends in the Far East</p>
                    <p>27. In the last two years the most active theater in the East-West struggle
                        has been in the Far East. There the Western powers have kept the Communists
                        from overrunning South Korea and Indochina while attempting to build up
                        anti-Communist strength through US support of the non-Communist countries in
                        this area. We believe it unlikely that the Communists will undertake new
                        local aggression in the Far East with identifiable Bloc forces. The emphasis
                        in Communist China over the next two years will probably be on building up
                        industrial and military strength. However, we believe that the Communists
                        would take counteraction against Western actions which they felt presented
                        an imminent threat to their security, even at the risk of widening
                        hostilities in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>28. It will be difficult to increase the strength, cohesion, and
                        anti-Communist orientation of the non-Communist states of the Far East. The
                        cessation of hostilities in Korea, together with Communist efforts to
                        promote rifts among the anti-Communist powers, <pb xml:id="pg_559" n="559"
                            facs="0589"/>will add to this difficulty. During the next two years
                        there is unlikely to be any significant improvement in the Western position
                        in this area; moreover, there are possibilities of serious deterioration,
                        particularly in Indochina, Indonesia, and Korea.</p>

                        conference, if it takes place, is unlikely to result in any agreement which
                        would alter the <hi rend="italic">status quo.</hi> The Communists are
                        unlikely to break the armistice by renewing hostilities, but they almost
                        certainly will not agree to Korean reunification on terms which would
                        endanger their control of North Korea. On the other hand, if President Rhee
                        remains convinced that the US could neither prevent an <gloss
                            target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed attack against the Communists nor
                        disassociate itself from military support of such action, once undertaken,
                        we believe that he will probably at some time seek to disrupt the armistice
                        by such an attack. If hostilities are renewed, the Communists will probably
                        take, at a minimum, the military measures they consider necessary to
                        maintain their position in Korea. Unless the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss> renews hostilities, we believe that there will be a
                        continued armed truce in this area, with both the US and USSR engaged in
                        reconstruction and in strengthening their respective Korean partners.</p>

                        is unlikely. The Communists probably will not attempt invasion so long as
                        the US defends Taiwan; and unless the US decides to support Chiang’s forces
                        directly, he in turn will be unable to undertake more than minor harassment
                        of the mainland.</p>

                                target="frus1952-54v08">volume XIII</ref>.</note> We believe that
                        there will almost certainly be important developments in the Indochina
                        situation during the period of this estimate. The steady deterioration of
                        France’s will to continue the struggle has been at least temporarily checked
                        by French resumption of the initiative under the Laniel–Navarre plan. We do
                        not believe, however, that the French will achieve a complete military
                        victory. The French objective is to reduce the drain of the Indochina war on
                        France, while maintaining a position for France in the Far East. The outcome
                        will depend on whether, by a combination of military victories and political
                        concessions, the French can strengthen the Associated States to the point
                        where these states will be able to maintain themselves against Communist
                        pressures with greatly reduced French support. The French would hope in this
                        way to create a situation which could serve as a basis for successful
                        negotiations with the Communists. The Laniel–Navarre plan may be the last
                        French effort in Indochina. Should it fail to achieve its objectives we
                        believe that, unless the US proves <pb xml:id="pg_560" n="560" facs="0590"
                        />willing to contribute forces, the French will in time seek to negotiate
                        directly with the Communists for the best possible terms.</p>
                    <p>32. For their part, the Chinese Communists will almost certainly continue
                        their present type of support for Viet Minh. They are unlikely to intervene
                        with organized units, at least in the absence of Western moves which in
                        their opinion threatened the security of Communist China. At the same time,
                        the Communists will probably talk of peace negotiations as part of their
                        propaganda campaign and might raise the Indochina issue in high level
                        political conferences. They are unlikely, however, to agree to any political
                        settlement which they believe would lessen their chances of eventually
                        gaining control of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Other Countries of Southeast Asia.</hi> Problems facing
                        the other Southeast Asian countries are those of attaining political
                        stability, coping with local insurrections, and meeting their own serious
                        economic problems. The outlook in the Philippines, and in the absence of
                        serious deterioration in the Indochina situation, in Burma, Thailand, and
                        Malaya, is for some improvement in stability, though these countries will by
                        no means resolve their numerous internal problems. In Indonesia, however,
                        the leftist character of the present government offers increased
                        opportunities for Communist penetration.</p>
                    <p>34. <hi rend="italic">Japan.</hi> Accumulating economic difficulties and the
                        reluctance or inability of the Japanese Government to adopt energetic
                        economic and rearmament policies are prolonging Japanese dependence on the
                        US and delaying Japan’s development as a counterweight to Communist power in
                        the Far East. At the same time there is growing anti-American sentiment in
                        Japan. Unless Japan can find the necessary foreign markets and take the
                        necessary internal economic measures, the development of a sound defense
                        structure as well as a sound economy will be endangered, the present
                        dominance of the moderate conservatives will be weakened, and the whole
                        pattern of US–Japanese cooperation will be threatened. We foresee no basic
                        change in Japan’s pro-Western orientation, but economic difficulties and
                        growing nationalism will create increased US–Japanese frictions and postpone
                        the development of a strong anti-Communist Japan.</p>

                        South Asia</p>
                    <p>35. In the underdeveloped areas of Asia and Africa the Western position has
                        deteriorated since World War II. Local nationalism has proved a force
                        against the West and the deep-seated revolutionary forces at work in these
                        areas have created political instability. It is difficult to overcome the
                        anti-Western sentiments of the newly independent Asian and African countries
                        and convince them that <pb xml:id="pg_561" n="561" facs="0591"/>Communist
                        policies threaten their independence. Except in Iran, however, the internal
                        Communist threat is small and is unlikely to grow greatly in the next two
                        years.</p>

                        believe that in certain areas there are prospects for improvement in the
                        West’s position. The fall of Mossadegh in Iran has at least temporarily
                        increased the opportunities for strengthening Iran’s internal stability and
                        settling the Anglo-Iranian oil disputes. <note n="8" xml:id="d96fn8">For

                        effect on both the stability of the Egyptian regime and on the Western
                        position throughout the Arab World. On the other hand, an Anglo-Egyptian
                        settlement may set the pattern for similar demands from Iraq. The
                        Arab-Israeli dispute will continue, but a renewal of large-scale hostilities
                        remains unlikely in view of the near military equilibrium of the two
                        parties, and the restraining influence of the US, the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>, and France. The more favorable policy that the US has
                        adopted toward the Arab States may contribute to better relations with them.
                        However, there remain possibilities of markedly adverse developments in this
                        volatile area. Although the deposition of the Sultan of Morocco has
                        temporarily bolstered French control, it is likely to drive the nationals to
                        more extreme positions since France seems unlikely to implement very
                        far-reaching reforms.</p>

                        remain preoccupied with their own serious economic and social problems; they

                        the cold war, but Pakistan, motivated largely by its desire to improve its
                        position vis-à-vis India, will continue its efforts to secure some pact with
                        the Western Powers, in return for extensive US aid. Some further improvement
                        in the relations of this area with the West may occur over the next two
                        years, but they will remain acutely sensitive both to anti-colonial disputes
                        in other areas and to any indications that the West is pursuing aggressive
                        cold war policies, particularly against Communist China.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Trends in Latin America</p>
                    <p>38. There will probably be a continued trend in Latin America toward
                        extremely nationalistic regimes based on demagogic appeals <pb
                            xml:id="pg_562" n="562" facs="0592"/>to sectors of new political
                        importance—organized labor, white-collar workers, and the lower middle
                        class. This trend will be most evident in countries where rapid social and
                        economic change is taking place. This change results from forced
                        industrialization at the expense of agriculture, which is generally
                        accompanied by severe inflation. Right or left extremism which poses
                        potential threats to US security interests will probably be strongest in
                        Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Guatemala, and possibly Brazil. In these
                        countries there will continue to be substantial Communist and demagogic
                        nationalist influences, which will attempt to channel the resentment of the
                        dislocated groups against the US. In Guatemala Communist influence over the
                        government, already strong, may increase. Communist penetration of British
                        Guiana has posed a new problem in the Caribbean area.</p>
                    <p>39. Most Latin American countries will probably continue to cooperate with
                        the US in the UN on basic East-West issues, although they will tend
                        increasingly to pursue an independent course on issues affecting
                        underdeveloped countries. Latin America will be increasingly concerned about
                        US trade and especially tariff policies. Regardless of the degree of Latin
                        American cooperation with the US, there will probably be an increasing
                        tendency to expand commercial and possibly diplomatic relations with the
                        Soviet Bloc.<note n="11" xml:id="d96fn11">On Oct. 26, Special Assistant to

                        (subparagraph 9–a (1) of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/1). The
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff assume that, in general, it would not be appropriate

                    <p>4. With respect to subparagraph 15–b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162/1, part of the revision recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff has
                        been accepted and a part rejected, with the result that, while the sense of
                        the subparagraph as now drafted is not entirely clear, it appears to lead to
                        the conclusion that current <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> objectives
                        with respect to the defense of Western Europe in the event of general war
                            <pb xml:id="pg_564" n="564" facs="0594"/>cannot be achieved, a
                        conclusion which the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider not to be justified at
                        this time. The impact of this conclusion upon our European <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners, should it become known, will be
                        readily obvious. In order to remove the possibility of such an
                        interpretation, and in the interest of arriving at phraseology which would
                        reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and at the same time be
                        acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff recommend that subparagraph 15–b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/1 be deleted and the following subparagraph
                        substituted. (For convenience, that part of the subparagraph which has been
                        changed is indicated by underscoring. <note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4">Printed

                        <item>“b. In Western Europe the build-up of military strength and the
                            progress of economic recovery has, at least partially, remedied a
                            situation of glaring weakness in a vital area. <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and associated forces are now sufficient to make
                            aggressive action in Europe costly for the USSR and to create a greater
                            feeling of confidence and security among the Western European peoples.
                                <hi rend="italic">However, even though significant progress has been
                                made in building up these forces, the military strength in Western
                                Europe is presently not sufficient to prevent a full-scale Soviet
                                attack from overrunning Western Europe. Even with the availability
                                of those German forces presently planned within the framework of
                                    <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, present rates of defense
                                spending by European nations and present rates of U.S. military
                                assistance certainly could not be expected to produce forces
                                adequate to prevent the initial loss of a considerable portion of
                                the territory of Western Europe in the event of a full-scale Soviet
                                attack. Therefore, since U.S. military assistance must eventually be
                                reduced, it is essential that the Western European states, including
                                West Germany, build and maintain maximum feasible defensive
                                strength.</hi> The major deterrent to aggression against Western
                            Europe is the manifest determination of the United States to use its
                            atomic capability and massive retaliatory striking power if the area is
                            attacked. However, the presence of U.S. forces in Western Europe makes a
                            contribution other than military to the strength and cohesion of the
                            free world coalition.”</item>

                        principally (a) some acceptance of the Treasury–Budget view on equating the
                        internal threat to the U.S. economy with the external Soviet threat, on the
                        basis of the Council’s discussion and the views expressed by the President,
                        and (b) compromise versions of certain paragraphs on reduction of the Soviet
                        threat previously unagreed (principally as between State and Defense). The
                        new paper also contains some additions to include points previously intended
                        for inclusion in a section on “Courses of Action”, which it has now been

                        glossed over rather than clearly decided in the paper, nevertheless it is a
                        generally satisfactory guide for U.S. policy. Presumably later <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers on more specific issues and

                    <p>Present at the 168th meeting of the Council were the President of the United
                        States, presiding; the Secretary of State; the Secretary of Defense; the
                        Acting Director, Foreign Operations Administration; the Director, Office of
                        Defense Mobilization. The Vice President did not attend the meeting because
                        of his absence from the country. Also present were the Secretary of the
                        Treasury; the Attorney General (for Items 2 and 3); the Director, Bureau of
                        the Budget; the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (for Items 2 and 3); the
                        Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers (for Item 2). The following were
                        present for Items 2, 3 and 7: the Secretary of the Army; the Secretary of
                        the Navy; the Acting Secretary of the Air Force; the Acting Chief of Staff,
                        U.S. Army; the Chief of Naval Operations; the Acting Chief of Staff, U.S.
                        Air Force; and the Acting Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps. Others also present
                        were the Director of Central Intelligence; the Assistant to the President;

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> gave the members of the
                        Council a very careful briefing on previous action with respect to this
                        report, and on the structure and content of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/1. He insisted that despite the feeling in certain
                        quarters that the policy was lacking in sharpness and in new content, it did
                        actually provide adequate guidance on a number of important points,
                        including emphasis on the internal threat to the U.S. economy, subsequent
                        redeployment of U.S. forces abroad, emphasis on massive retaliatory
                        offensive capability, normalization of atomic weapons, the build-up of
                        German and Japanese defensive strength, and continued pressure on the
                        Soviets but hospitality towards any genuine possibility of negotiating
                        settlements with the USSR.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out
                        that the rules and regulations governing the exchange of atomic energy
                        information had been developed at a period when the United States had a
                        monopoly in the field and wished to retain it. The monopoly was now gone,
                        and accordingly it was time to review the prohibitions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                        another question to raise with respect to paragraph 39–b. Was the policy
                        statement in this paragraph in accordance with the law of the land as set
                        forth in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946? It seemed to be our policy that the
                        President would, in certain contingencies, allow our allies to have and use
                        atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that the matter of
                        custody of weapons was not at issue in the present paper, but Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> thought that,
                        indirectly at least, the custody issue was raised. He observed that the
                        President could turn over these weapons for immediate use if he deemed it in
                        the interest of the national security. Accordingly the custody problem was
                        involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> agreed with
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>, and noted that
                        the existing policy paper on custody would have to be revised if the
                        President approved paragraph 39–b</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then read to the
                        Council a proposed amendment to paragraph 42-d which had been agreed by the
                        Planning Board. The objective of the revision was to indicate that the
                        decision of the United States, to make clear to the leaders and people of
                        the USSR that if the USSR forgoes external expansion, relinquishes
                        domination of other peoples, etc., the United States would be prepared to
                        accept continuance of the internal political and economic organization of
                        the USSR, was a directive in the diplomatic field and was not intended to
                        constitute guidance for our information and propaganda <pb xml:id="pg_569"
                            n="569" facs="0599"/>agencies. The directive to the latter was set forth
                        in paragraph 44–b.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D. Jackson</persName> expressed
                        emphatic approval of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        suggested revision, and said that if the present language of paragraph 42–d
                        remained, it could be interpreted as an endorsement of the Soviet system as
                        it now existed.</p>
                    <p>The President likewise expressed approval of the new language, as did the
                        Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of State. On the other
                        hand, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> thought
                        that the subject deserved further study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then stated that
                        he wished to raise a point with regard to pressures on the Soviet Union as
                        set forth on page 25 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/1. Certain
                        of his people in the State Department had expressed concern at the absence
                        of any specific inhibition against aggressive action vis-à-vis the Soviet
                        bloc. They had in mind such projects as the detachment of Albania or an
                        assault on Hainan Island, which had been discussed earlier. As long, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, as it is quite
                        clear that no such actions as these would be undertaken without
                        consideration by the National Security Council, he was willing to let the
                        present language on page 25 stand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called the
                        Council’s attention to the revision of paragraph 15–b with regard to the
                        build-up of strength in Western Europe, adding that he thought the revision
                        suggested by the Joint Chiefs constituted an improvement on the present
                        version of the paragraph.<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">See the memorandum by
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Oct. 27, <ref target="#pg_562">p.
                            562</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        strong dislike of the content of this paragraph, since, he said, to him it
                        indicated that we were telling our allies in Western Europe to spend more
                        money on their military defense than they are doing at the moment, whereas
                        in fact present expenditures were causing these allies to go broke.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> challenged the
                        statement of the Secretary of the Treasury, who, in turn, cited France as an
                        illustration of his point.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that whatever the situation of the economies of the
                        Western European powers, 1953 had been the best year in a long time for
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> continued to
                        argue, however, that it was unwise to ask our allies to undertake what we
                        cannot ourselves accomplish. Their defense expenditures should be calculated
                        in relation to their economic capabilities. If they overspend, we would
                        ultimately have to foot the bill.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, the President expressed approval of the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> revision, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> went on to call attention to the
                        next <pb xml:id="pg_570" n="570" facs="0600"/>important point raised by the
                        Joint Chiefs’ comments, namely, their suggestion with regard to paragraph
                        9–a–(1), which in its present form called for a “strong military posture”,
                        with emphasis on the capability of inflicting massive retaliatory damage,
                        and which the Joint Chiefs wished to change to read “a strong military
                        posture to include emphasis on the capability”, etc.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained that
                        the Planning Board had not viewed this proposed change favorably, the
                        President observed that this seemed to him to be a highly academic argument.
                        A strong military posture, said the President, pre-supposes a basis of
                        general strength, but it does not exclude emphasis on certain aspects of
                        such strength. He liked the word “emphasize”, he continued, because it
                        provided some sense of priority for our military planning. Certainly we do
                        not want to build up equally all types and varieties of military
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> pointed out to
                        the President that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were at present feeling the
                        pinch of trimming their sails. Our national policy commitments had, of
                        course, not changed. If, therefore, we set priorities as this paragraph
                        recommended, this was bound to affect the character and composition of our
                        forces, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>
                        insisted that the time had not yet come to effect such changes and could not
                        come as long as our present military commitments remained unchanged.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired,
                        with some heat, if the time had not come to make such changes, when did
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> imagine it would
                        come? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> replied,
                        when you change our commitments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> manifested some
                        impatience with the talk about commitments. He insisted that we are not
                        committed to the maintenance of any specified number of ground forces in
                        Europe. We were committed to go to war there if there were an attack on a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country. Certainly, however, if
                        the Soviets attacked Norway, we were not committed to reply by fighting a
                        war in Norway. We would be much more likely to retaliate somewhere else
                        where the military advantages would be clear.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>
                        insisted that, nevertheless, we do have large numbers of military forces
                        situated in Europe and committed there as of the present time, to which
                        point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> added
                        that “quite a wind” blew on this subject this last week.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                        the reason the wind blew was not because of the possibility that withdrawing
                        some of our ground forces from Europe had led the Europeans to fear that
                        they would be unable to defend Western Europe against Soviet aggression. The
                        real reason for the alarm in Europe about such a redeployment had arisen
                        because the American forces presently stationed there <pb xml:id="pg_571"
                            n="571" facs="0601"/>are the chief means by which the Europeans hope to
                        see a welding together of French and German military resources. This was
                        primarily a political rather than a military matter. What was at stake in
                        the present discussion in the Council was how best to assure the defense of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented
                        that as he understood it the National Security Council was supposed to be
                        considering at present the redeployment of large numbers of U.S. troops
                        overseas and a thorough-going revision of our whole military strategy. If we
                        did not propose to do either of these things, the whole purpose and
                        objective of our deliberations was lost.</p>
                    <p>The President answered Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> by saying that the real issue was not the pros and
                        cons of redeployment, but rather how fast such a redeployment could be
                        carried out. He again reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> that no matter what we now decided as to the size
                        and character of our military establishment, we could not effect changes in
                        its present composition very rapidly. The whole structure was too immense
                        and complicated, and all we could do now was to set up new goals and
                        initiate action to reach them. Furthermore, said the President, we must not
                        lose sight of the political and morale problems which would be involved in
                        any abrupt change and redeployment of our forces. Nevertheless, continued
                        the President, he did emphatically believe that we must begin to look
                        forward to the day when we could realize the new concept which we had been
                        discussing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, speaking in
                        defense of the views of the Joint Chiefs with regard to paragraph 9–a,
                        repeated the conviction of the Joint Chiefs that they could not remove our
                        troops from Europe in view of the present commitments there. He pointed out
                        in addition that we were contemplating increased expenditures on other
                        aspects of our military posture; for example, on continental defense. In
                        short, there were other things to be emphasized besides the retaliatory
                        striking power, and for this reason Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> preferred the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that
                        if we accepted the version proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we would
                        be abandoning all our attempts to secure a radically new and different
                        military policy.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> answered that of
                        course the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that apart from our offensive
                        missions the armed forces had very important defensive jobs to do. It was
                        unwise, he insisted, to put all our eggs in one basket of striking power,
                        and that the Joint Chiefs preferred a version of this paragraph which
                        expressed a reasonable balance of military capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Unconvinced, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        insisted that to emphasize one mission certainly didn’t mean the exclusion
                        of other important <pb xml:id="pg_572" n="572" facs="0602"/>missions.
                        However, if we ever proposed to make a real change in our military posture,
                        we’ve got to begin some time to do it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C. D. Jackson</persName>, addressing
                        the President said, “You set some very excellent ground rules when this
                        problem of redeployment first came to the attention of the National Security
                        Council. You said in the first instance that no one was to talk about the
                        problem except with his advisers while the Secretary of State explored the
                        ‘how’ and the ‘how soon’ of accomplishing the redeployment. After the
                        Secretary of State reported his findings you would make the decision as to
                        redeployment. These were good ground rules when you first gave them out, and
                        they continue to be at the present time.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> commented that there
                        were three elements of our defense posture specified in paragraph 9–a. While
                        the Planning Board was deliberately emphasizing retaliatory striking power,
                        it was obvious that there was no intention of excluding other important
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he still preferred the Planning Board version of
                        the statement on our military posture. After all, deterring war was even
                        more important than winning a war. No deterrent to war could compare in
                        importance with this retaliatory striking power. Why don’t we therefore say
                        what we mean to emphasize?</p>
                    <p>In reply to this point, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1"
                            >Carney</persName> said that the use of the term “emphasize” as
                        presently stated meant in effect giving first priority to this attack force.
                        He could discern many undesirable imbalances if the word “emphasize” were
                        used.</p>
                    <p>Addressing himself to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1"
                            >Carney</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> inquired, “But are you not planning ultimately to
                        change your strategy and the composition of your forces?”</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> asked to be
                        permitted to summarize the history of the Joint Chiefs’ thinking on this
                        whole problem. He reminded the Council that before the new Chiefs had
                        formally taken office the objective of reducing the cost of the military
                        establishment had been handed to them with a request to study and report on
                        how such reduction could be accomplished. After such study the Chiefs
                        reported that a real reduction in cost could be achieved only by the
                        redeployment of American forces stationed overseas. They did not, however,
                        make an immediate recommendation that such redeployment be initiated.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated with
                        emphasis that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>’s
                        remarks outlined our basic difficulties. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he thought that
                        the Chiefs meant to begin such redeployment at once, and that the State
                        Department was to prepare the way for the initiation. Now Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> says that the Chiefs <pb
                            xml:id="pg_573" n="573" facs="0603"/>never made any such proposal and
                        recommendation. There ensued a discussion between Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName>, which was concluded by a
                        statement by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> to
                        the effect that if, in the course of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        analysis of the redeployment problem, the conclusions turned out to be
                        different from those originally hoped for, the Chiefs had no option but to
                        change their views. After all, it was their responsibility to provide the
                        best military advice they could to the President and to the National
                        Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> added the
                        comment that the President has already said that we could not change our
                        military posture overnight. Furthermore, the State Department cannot change
                        at once the political situation overseas in order to make possible a change
                        in military posture. This left the Defense Department in a very delicate
                        position. While it recognized the need for economic stability at home, it
                        was also responsible for the maintenance of our military strength abroad.
                        This was the crux of the problem. In their study of the problem the Chiefs
                        had come up with proposals which recommended themselves to him. Meanwhile,
                        the budget has got to be prepared, and the great problem facing the Defense
                        Department was how to get the budget ready for presentation to Congress. To
                        be sure, the Chiefs had, on October 2, come back with much the same answers
                        to military problems that had been given before, but that was because the
                        necessary preliminary changes in commitments had not been made. Furthermore,
                        it was found necessary to add something to the military budget to take care
                        of increased continental defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> then paused to read from a memorandum designed to
                        indicate where the Defense Department found itself now in the process of
                        preparing a budget. (A copy of this statement is filed in the Minutes of the
                        168th <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.)<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d99fn4">The memorandum has not been found. For information on

                    </p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>’s remarks, the President expressed some doubt as to
                        whether he had followed the direction of the argument and the points which
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> was making, but
                        said that in any case, with regard to paragraph 9–a, we should certainly
                        adopt the Planning Board version with its emphasis on retaliatory offensive
                        striking power. In effect, we should state what we propose to do, namely, to
                        keep the minimum respectable posture of defense while emphasizing this
                        particular offensive capability. Nobody could possibly reduce from such a
                        statement that we propose to abandon the defense of New York City.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> inquired whether it
                        would be appropriate for the record of action to note the dissent of the
                        Defense Department with <pb xml:id="pg_574" n="574" facs="0604"/>respect to
                        this paragraph, but the President replied, with considerable warmth, that he
                        would tolerate no notice of a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> dissent in
                        the record of action. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were, after all, his
                        military advisers; he made the decisions. If the Joint Chiefs or the Defense
                        Department, after a suitable interval, felt that the agreed statement on our
                        military posture did not serve the best interests of the nation’s defense,
                        the President said he fully expected them to come to him and tell him so. He
                        would then reconsider the problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that
                        he fully realized how delicate was the operation to redeploy American forces
                        from overseas stations. Indeed, it might prove too delicate an operation to
                        undertake. In any event, it will take time to accomplish, and the decision
                        to try it must first be made at the very highest levels of government. This
                        matter of emphasizing the retaliatory capability may consume two or even
                        three years, but if we do not decide now on this change, no change will ever
                        occur. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                        that he himself was against immediate change, and furthermore pointed out
                        that there are safeguards written in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162/1 which would prevent accomplishing this change too hastily.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> had stated, with greater clarity than he himself had
                        been able to, the President’s own position, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> agreed that, as a result of the
                        discussion, this issue had now been sufficiently clarified.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> then inquired whether
                        the statement on page 7 implied that the Government would undertake the
                        expense of the dispersal of production plant capacity. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> replied in the negative,
                        and pointed out that there would be no cost to the Government except
                        indirectly through tax amortization.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> went on to say that he
                        had also another more general question. He had detected nothing in this
                        paper with regard to any theoretical date for D–Day readiness. As this date
                        had figured in prior statements of policy, he wished assurance that it was
                        not implied anywhere in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/1. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> received the desired
                        assurance that no such date was contemplated.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> said that he was
                        much worried by the final sentence of paragraph 46, which read, “whenever
                        there is substantial evidence that the USSR is likely to develop the
                        capability to knock out our atomic striking power, the entire policy of the
                        United States toward the Soviet Union will have to be radically
                        re-examined.” Will we ever, inquired Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName>, be sure that we have
                        substantial evidence of such a capability on the part of the USSR? Would we
                        have time, in this contingency, to re-examine our entire policy? The answer
                        to both these questions seemed to Admiral <pb xml:id="pg_575" n="575"
                            facs="0605"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> to be no, and he
                        suggested therefore that the sentence be either omitted or radically
                        revised.</p>
                    <p>The President said that of course we all recognize that Soviet military
                        capabilities are constantly growing, and that these capabilities must be
                        kept under continuous examination.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, it was agreed to revise the sentence along the
                        lines of the President’s suggestion.</p>
                    <p>At this point, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BURNSDAF1">Burns</persName>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic Problems of National Security Policy</p>
                    <p>1. a. To meet the Soviet threat to U.S. security.</p>
                    <p>b. In doing so, to avoid seriously weakening the U.S. economy or undermining
                        our fundamental values and institutions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Threat to the United States</p>
                    <p>2. The primary threat to the security, free institutions, and fundamental
                        values of the United States is posed by the combination of:</p>
                    <p>a. Basic Soviet hostility to the non-communist world, particularly to the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>b. Great Soviet military power.</p>
                    <p>c. Soviet control of the international communist apparatus and other means of
                        subversion or division of the free world.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_579" n="579" facs="0609"/>
                    <p>3. a. The authority of the Soviet regime does not appear to have been
                        impaired by the events since <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName>’s death, or to be likely to be appreciably weakened
                        during the next few years. The transfer of power may cause some uncertainty
                        in Soviet and satellite tactics for some time, but will probably not impair
                        the basic economic and military strength of the Soviet bloc. The Soviet
                        rulers can be expected to continue to base their policy on the conviction of
                        irreconcilable hostility between the bloc and the non-communist world. This
                        conviction is the compound product of Marxist belief in their historically
                        determined conflict with, and inevitable triumph over, “world capitalism”
                        led by the United States, of fear for the security of the regime and the
                        USSR, especially in the face of a hostile coalition, of distrust of U.S.
                        aims and intentions, and of long-established reliance on techniques of
                        conspiracy and subversion. Accordingly, the basic Soviet objectives continue
                        to be consolidation and expansion of their own sphere of power and the
                        eventual domination of the non-communist world.</p>
                    <p>b. Soviet strategy has been flexible and will probably continue so, allowing
                        for retreats and delays as well as advances. The various “peace gestures” so
                        far have cost the Soviets very little in actual concessions and could be
                        merely designed to divide the West by raising false hopes and seeking to
                        make the United States appear unyielding. It is possible, however, that the
                        USSR, for internal and other reasons, may desire a settlement of specific
                        issues or a relaxation of tensions and military preparations for a
                        substantial period. Thus far, there are no convincing signs of readiness to
                        make important concessions to this end.</p>
                    <p>4. a. The capability of the USSR to attack the United States with atomic
                        weapons has been continuously growing and will be materially enhanced by
                        hydrogen weapons. The USSR has sufficient bombs and aircraft, using one-way
                        missions, to inflict serious damage on the United States, especially by
                        surprise attack. The USSR soon may have the capability of dealing a
                        crippling blow to our industrial base and our continued ability to prosecute
                        a war. Effective defense could reduce the likelihood and intensity of a
                        hostile attack but not eliminate the chance of a crippling blow.</p>
                    <p>b. The USSR now devotes about one-sixth of its gross national product to
                        military outlays and is expected to continue this level. It has and will
                        continue to have large conventional military forces capable of aggression
                        against countries of the free world. Within the next two years, the Soviet
                        bloc is not expected to increase the size of its forces, but will strengthen
                        them with improved equipment and training and the larger atomic
                        stockpile.</p>
                    <p>c. The Soviet bloc now has the capability of strong defense against air
                        attack on critical targets within the USSR under favorable <pb
                            xml:id="pg_580" n="580" facs="0610"/>weather conditions, and is likely
                        to continue to strengthen its all-weather air defenses.</p>
                    <p>5. a. The recent uprisings in East Germany <note n="7" xml:id="d100fn7">For
                            documentation on the June 1953 disturbances in the German Democratic
                            Republic, see <ref target="frus1952-54v07p1">volume VII</ref>.</note>
                        and the unrest in other European satellites evidence the failure of the
                        Soviets fully to subjugate these peoples or to destroy their desire for
                        freedom; the dependence of these satellite governments on Soviet armed
                        forces; and the relative unreliability of satellite armed forces (especially
                        if popular resistance in the satellites should increase). These events
                        necessarily have placed internal and psychological strains upon the Soviet
                        leadership. Nevertheless, the ability of the USSR to exercise effective
                        control over, and to exploit the resources of, the European satellites has
                        not been appreciably reduced and is not likely to be so long as the USSR
                        maintains adequate military forces in the area.</p>
                    <p>b. The detachment of any major European satellite from the Soviet bloc does
                        not now appear feasible except by Soviet acquiescence or by war. Such a
                        detachment would not decisively affect the Soviet military capability either
                        in delivery of weapons of mass destruction or in conventional forces, but
                        would be a considerable blow to Soviet prestige and would impair in some
                        degree Soviet conventional military capabilities in Europe.</p>
                    <p>c. The Chinese Communist regime is firmly in control and is unlikely to be
                        shaken in the foreseeable future by domestic forces or rival regimes, short
                        of the occurrence of a major war. The alliance between the regimes of
                        Communist China and the USSR is based on common ideology and current
                        community of interests. With the death of <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName> and the Korean truce, Communist China may tend more
                        to emphasize its own interests, though limited by its present economic and
                        military dependence on the USSR, and, in the long run, basic differences may
                        strain or break the alliance. At present, however, it appears to be firmly
                        established and adds strategic territory and vast reserves of military
                        manpower to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>6. a. The USSR does not seem likely deliberately to launch a general war
                        against the United States during the period covered by current estimates
                        (through mid-1955). The uncertain prospects for Soviet victory in a general
                        war, the change in leadership, satellite unrest, and the U.S. capability to
                        retaliate massively, make such a course improbable. Similarly, an attack on
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries or other areas which
                        would be almost certain to bring on general war in view of U.S. commitments
                        or intentions would be unlikely. The Soviets will not, however, be deterred
                        by fear of general war from <pb xml:id="pg_581" n="581" facs="0611"/>taking
                        the measures they consider necessary to counter Western actions which they
                        view as a serious threat to their security.</p>
                    <p>b. When both the USSR and the United States reach a stage of atomic plenty
                        and ample means of delivery, each will have the probable capacity to inflict
                        critical damage on the other, but is not likely to be able to prevent major
                        atomic retaliations. This could create a stalemate, with both sides
                        reluctant to initiate general warfare; although if the Soviets believed that
                        initial surprise held the prospect of destroying the capacity for
                        retaliation, they might be tempted into attacking.</p>
                    <p>c. Although Soviet fear of atomic reaction should still inhibit local
                        aggression, increasing Soviet atomic capability may tend to diminish the
                        deterrent effect of U.S. atomic power against peripheral Soviet aggression.
                        It may also sharpen the reaction of the USSR to what it considers
                        provocative acts of the United States. If either side should miscalculate
                        the strength of the other’s reaction, such local conflicts could grow into
                        general war, even though neither seeks nor desires it. To avoid this, it
                        will in general be desirable for the United States to make clear to the USSR
                        the kind of actions which will be almost certain to lead to this result,
                        recognizing, however, that as general war becomes more devastating for both
                        sides the threat to resort to it becomes less available as a sanction
                        against local aggression.</p>
                    <p>7. The USSR will continue to rely heavily on tactics of division and
                        subversion to weaken the free world alliances and will to resist the Soviet
                        power. Using both the fear of atomic warfare and the hope of peace, such
                        political warfare will seek to exploit differences among members of the free
                        world, neutralist attitudes, and anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments in
                        underdeveloped areas. For these purposes, communist parties and other
                        cooperating elements will be used to manipulate opinion and control
                        governments wherever possible. This aspect of the Soviet threat is likely to
                        continue indefinitely and to grow in intensity.</p>
                    <p>8. Over time, changes in the outlook and policies of the leadership of the
                        USSR may result from such factors as the slackening of revolutionary zeal,
                        the growth of vested managerial and bureaucratic interests, and popular
                        pressures for consumption goods. Such changes, combined with the growing
                        strength of the free world and the failure to break its cohesion, and
                        possible aggravation of weaknesses within the Soviet bloc through U.S. or
                        allied action or otherwise, might induce a willingness to negotiate. The
                        Soviet leadership might find it desirable and even essential to reach
                        agreements acceptable to the United States and its allies, without
                        necessarily abandoning its basic hostility to the non-Soviet world.</p>

                    <p>9. In the face of the Soviet threat, the security of the United States
                        requires:</p>
                    <p>a. Development and maintenance of:</p>

                    <p>b. Maintenance of a sound, strong and growing economy, capable of providing

                        <item>(1) Developing and maintaining production plant capacity, dispersed
                            with a view to minimizing destruction by enemy attack and capable of

                            shipping capacity reaches the required wartime levels.</item>
                        <item>(3) Maintaining stockpiling programs, and providing additional
                            production facilities, for those materials the shortage of which would
                            affect critically essential defense programs; meanwhile reducing the
                            rates of other stockpile materials.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>e. Provide reasonable internal security against covert attack, sabotage,
                        subversion, and espionage, particularly against the clandestine introduction
                        and detonation of atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>11. Within the free world, only the United States can provide and maintain,
                        for a period of years to come, the atomic capability to counterbalance
                        Soviet atomic power. Thus, sufficient atomic weapons and effective means of
                        delivery are indispensable for U.S. security. Moreover, in the face of
                        Soviet atomic power, defense of the continental United States becomes vital
                        to effective security: to protect our striking force, our mobilization base,
                        and our people. Such atomic capability is also a major contribution to the
                        security of our allies, as well as of this country.</p>
                    <p>12. The United States cannot, however, meet its defense needs, even at
                        exorbitant cost, without the support of allies.</p>
                    <p>a. The effective use of U.S. strategic air power against the USSR will
                        require overseas bases on foreign territory for some years to come. Such
                        bases will continue indefinitely to be an important additional element of
                        U.S. strategic air capability and to be essential to the conduct of the
                        military operations on the Eurasian continent in case of general war. The
                        availability of such bases and their use by the United States in case of
                        need will depend, in most cases, on the consent and cooperation of the
                        nations where they are located. Such nations will assume the risks entailed
                        only if convinced that their own security will thereby be best served.</p>
                    <p>b. The United States needs to have aligned on its side in the world struggle,
                        in peace and in war, the armed forces and economic resources and materials
                        of the major highly-industrialized non-communist states. Progressive loss to
                        the Soviet bloc of these states would so isolate the United States and alter
                        the world balance as to endanger the capacity of the United States to win in
                        the event of general war or to maintain an adequate defense without
                        undermining its fundamental institutions.</p>
                    <p>c. U.S. strategy including the use of atomic weapons, therefore, can be
                        successfully carried out only if our essential allies are convinced that it
                        is conceived and will be implemented for the purpose of mutual security and
                        defense against the Soviet threat. U.S. leadership <pb xml:id="pg_584"
                            n="584" facs="0614"/>in this regard, however, does not imply the
                        necessity to meet all desires of our allies.</p>
                    <p>d. Our allies are, in turn, dependent on the United States for their
                        security: (1) they lack that atomic capability which is the major deterrent
                        to Soviet aggression; (2) most lack political and economic stability
                        sufficient to support their military forces. The United States should be
                        able for the foreseeable future to provide military aid, in more limited
                        amounts than heretofore, to our essential allies. It should be possible in
                        the near future, however, generally to eliminate most grant economic aid, if
                        coupled with appropriate U.S. economic and trade policies.</p>
                    <p>13. a. Under existing treaties or policies, an attack on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Western Germany, Berlin,
                        Japan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and the American Republics,
                        or on the Republic of Korea, would involve the United States in war with the
                        USSR, or at least with Communist China if the aggression were Chinese
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>b. Certain other countries, such as Indo-China or Formosa, are of such
                        strategic importance to the United States that an attack on them probably
                        would compel the United States to react with military force either locally
                        at the point of attack or generally against the military power of the
                        aggressor. Moreover, the principle of collective security through the United
                        Nations, if it is to continue to survive as a deterrent to continued
                        piecemeal aggression and a promise of an eventual effective world security
                        system, should be upheld even in areas not of vital strategic
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>c. The assumption by the United States, as the leader of the free world, of a
                        substantial degree of responsibility for the freedom and security of the
                        free nations is a direct and essential contribution to the maintenance of
                        its own freedom and security.</p>
                    <p>14. a. The United States should keep open the possibility of settlements with
                        the USSR, compatible with basic U.S. security interests, which would resolve
                        specific conflicts or reduce the magnitude of the Soviet threat. Moreover,
                        to maintain the continued support of its allies, the United States must seek
                        to convince them of its desire to reach such settlements. But, in doing so,
                        we must not allow the possibility of such settlements to delay or reduce
                        efforts to develop and maintain adequate free world strength, and thus
                        enable the Soviets to increase their relative strength.</p>
                    <p>b. It must be recognized, however, that the prospects for acceptable
                        negotiated settlements are not encouraging. There is no evidence that the
                        Soviet leadership is prepared to modify its basic attitudes and accept any
                        permanent settlement with the United States, although it may be prepared for
                        a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> on certain issues. Atomic and other
                        major weapons can be controlled only by adequate and enforceable safeguards
                        which would involve some <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0615"/>form of
                        international inspection and supervision. Acceptance of such serious
                        restrictions by either side would be extremely difficult under existing
                        conditions of suspicion and distrust. The chances for such disarmament would
                        perhaps be improved by agreements on other conflicts either beforehand or at
                        the same time, or by possible realization by the Soviets, in time, that
                        armament limitation will serve their own interests and security.</p>
                    <p>c. The United States should promptly determine what it would accept as an
                        adequate system of armament control which would effectively remove or reduce
                        the Soviet atomic and military threat, and on what basis the United States
                        would be prepared to negotiate to obtain it.</p>

                            xml:id="d100fn-sym1">The term “coalition” refers to those states which
                            are parties to the network of security treaties and regional alliances
                            of which the United States is a member (<gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                    </p>
                    <p>15. a. The effort of the United States, especially since 1950, to build up
                        the strength, cohesion and common determination of the free world has
                        succeeded in increasing its relative strength and may well have prevented
                        overt military aggression since Korea.</p>
                    <p>b. In Western Europe the build-up of military strength and the progress of
                        economic recovery has, at least partially, remedied a situation of glaring
                        weakness in a vital area. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                        associated forces are now sufficient to make aggressive action in Europe
                        costly for the USSR and to create a greater feeling of confidence and
                        security among the Western European peoples. However, even though
                        significant progress has been made in building up these forces, the military
                        strength in Western Europe is presently not sufficient to prevent a
                        full-scale Soviet attack from overrunning Western Europe. Even with the
                        availability of those German forces presently planned within the framework
                        of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, present rates of defense spending by
                        European Nations and present rates of U.S. Military Assistance certainly
                        could not be expected to produce forces adequate to prevent the initial loss
                        of a considerable portion of the territory of Western Europe in the event of
                        a full-scale Soviet attack. Therefore, since U.S. Military Assistance must
                        eventually be reduced, it is essential that the Western European states,
                        including West Germany, build and maintain maximum feasible defensive
                        strength. The major deterrent to aggression against Western Europe is the
                        manifest determination of the United States to use its atomic capability and
                        massive retaliatory striking power if the area is attacked. However, the
                        presence of U.S. forces in <pb xml:id="pg_586" n="586" facs="0616"/>Western
                        Europe makes a contribution other than military to the strength and cohesion
                        of the free world coalition.</p>
                    <p>c. In the Far East, the military strength of the coalition now rests largely
                        on U.S. military power plus that of France in Indochina, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in Malaya and Hong Kong, and the indigenous
                        forces of the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and Nationalist China. Any
                        material increase will require the revival of the economic and military
                        strength of Japan.</p>
                    <p>d. The strength and cohesion of the coalition depends, and will continue to
                        depend, on the continuing strength and will of the United States as its
                        leader, and upon the assumption by each coalition member of a proper share
                        of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>16. While the coalition is founded on common interest and remains basically
                        sound, certain factors tend to weaken its cohesion and to slow down the
                        necessary build-up of strength.</p>
                    <p>a. Some of these factors are inherent in the nature of a coalition led by one
                        strong power. The economic and military recovery by our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies from their low point of a few
                        years ago, and the revival of Germany and Japan, has given them a greater
                        sense of independence from U.S. guidance and direction. Specific sources of
                        irritation are trade with the Soviet bloc, the level of the defense effort,
                        use of bases and other facilities, and the prospect of discontinuance of
                        U.S. economic aid without a corresponding change in U.S. trade policies.</p>
                    <p>b. The coalition also suffers from certain other weaknesses and dilemmas. A
                        major weakness is the instability of the governments of certain <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners, such as Italy and France. The
                        colonial issue in Asia and Africa, for example, has not only weakened our
                        European allies but has left those areas in a state of ferment which weakens
                        the whole free world. Efforts by the United States to encourage orderly
                        settlements tend to leave both sides dissatisfied and to create friction
                        within the alliance. Age-old issues such as divide France and Germany, or
                        Italy and Yugoslavia, still impede creation of a solid basis of cooperation
                        against the Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p>c. Moreover, allied opinion, especially in Europe, has become less willing to
                        follow U.S. leadership. Many Europeans fear that American policies,
                        particularly in the Far East, may involve Europe in general war, or will
                        indefinitely prolong cold-war tensions. Many consider U.S. attitudes toward
                        the Soviets as too rigid and unyielding and, at the same time, as unstable,
                        holding risks ranging from preventive war and “liberation” to withdrawal
                        into isolation. Many consider that these policies fail to reflect the
                        perspective and confidence expected in the leadership of a great nation, and
                        reflect too great a preoccupation with anti-communism. Important sectors of
                        allied opinion are also concerned over developments within the United States
                        which seem to them inconsistent with our assumed role of leader in the cause
                        of freedom. These allied attitudes materially impair cooperation and, if not
                        overcome, could imperil the coalition.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_587" n="587" facs="0617"/>
                    <p>d. Fear of what a general war will mean for them is deeply rooted and
                        widespread among our allies. They tend to see the actual danger of Soviet
                        aggression as less imminent than the United States does, and some have a
                        fatalistic feeling that if it is coming they will not be able to do much
                        about it. In the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, many have
                        serious doubts whether the defense requirements can be met without
                        intolerable political and economic strains. Certain of our allies fear the
                        rearmament of Germany and Japan on any large scale, and in Germany and Japan
                        themselves strong currents of opinion oppose it as unnecessary or dangerous.
                        Moreover, in certain countries, particularly France and Italy, grave
                        domestic problems have called into question not only the authority of the
                        governments, but also the basic foreign policies and alignments which they
                        have followed. All these factors lead to allied pressure in favor of new
                        major efforts to negotiate with the USSR, as the only hope of ending the
                        present tension, fear and frustration. This pressure has increased with
                        recent “peace gestures” of the new Soviet leadership, which has made every
                        endeavor to exploit it. Whether these hopes are illusory or well-founded,
                        they must be taken into consideration by the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Uncommitted Areas of the World</p>
                    <p>17. Despite the Soviet threat, many nations and societies outside the Soviet
                        bloc, mostly in the underdeveloped areas, are so unsure of their national
                        interests, or so preoccupied with other pressing problems, that they are
                        presently unwilling to align themselves actively with the United States and
                        its allies. Although largely undeveloped, their vast manpower, their
                        essential raw materials and their potential for growth are such that their
                        absorption within the Soviet system would greatly, perhaps decisively, alter
                        the world balance of power to our detriment. Conversely, their orderly
                        development into more stable and responsible nations, able and willing to
                        participate in defense of the free world, can increasingly add to its
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>18. In many of these uncommitted areas, forces of unrest and of resentment
                        against the West are strong. Among these sources are racial feelings,
                        anti-colonialism, rising nationalism, popular demand for rapid social and
                        economic progress, over-population, the breakdown of static social patterns,
                        and, in many cases, the conflict of local religious and social philosophies
                        with those of the West. The general unreliability of the governments of
                        these states and the volatility of their political life complicate the task
                        of building firm ties with them, of counteracting neutralism and, where
                        appropriate and feasible, of responding to requests for assistance in
                        solving their problems. Outside economic assistance alone cannot be counted
                        on either to solve their basic problems or to win their cooperation and
                        support. Constructive political and other measures <pb xml:id="pg_588"
                            n="588" facs="0618"/>will be required to create a sense of mutuality of
                        interest with the free world and to counter the communist appeals.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Ability to Support Security Expenditures</p>
                    <p>19. The United States must maintain a sound economy based on free private
                        enterprise as a basis both for high defense productivity and for the
                        maintenance of its living standards and free institutions. Not only the
                        world position of the United States, but the security of the whole free
                        world, is dependent on the avoidance of recession and on the long-term
                        expansion of the U.S. economy. Threats to its stability or growth,
                        therefore, constitute a danger to the security of the United States and of
                        the coalition which it leads. Expenditures for national security, in fact
                        all federal, state and local governmental expenditures, must be carefully
                        scrutinized with a view to measuring their impact on the national
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>20. The economy of the country has a potential for long-term economic growth.
                        Over the years an expanding national income can provide the basis for higher
                        standards of living and for a substantial military program. But economic
                        growth is not automatic and requires fiscal and other policies which will
                        foster and not hamper the potential for long-term growth and which will
                        operate to reduce cyclical fluctuations.</p>
                    <p>21. Excessive government spending leads to inflationary deficits or to
                        repressive taxation, or to both. Persistent inflation is a barrier to
                        long-term growth because it undermines confidence in the currency, reduces
                        savings, and makes restrictive economic controls necessary. Repressive
                        taxation weakens the incentives for efficiency, effort, and investment on
                        which economic growth depends.</p>
                    <p>22. In spite of the reimposition of tax rates at approximately the peak
                        levels of World War II, expenditures have risen faster than tax receipts,
                        with a resulting deficit of $9.4 billion in fiscal year 1953. Despite
                        anticipated larger receipts, without the imposition of new taxes, and
                        assuming substantially unchanged world conditions, a deficit of $3.8 billion
                        is estimated for fiscal year 1954.</p>
                    <p>23. a. Under existing law, tax reductions of $5 billion a year will become
                        effective next January. A proposal to impose substitute taxes therefor would
                        be a reversal of policy.</p>
                    <p>b. Additional revenue losses of $3 billion a year are due to occur on April
                        1, 1954. Congress has not acted on the President’s recommendation that these
                        reductions be rescinded. Even if the $3 billion reduction is rescinded, or
                        offset by revenue from new sources, large deficits would occur in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1956 at present levels of expenditures.</p>
                    <p>c. The economic problem is made more difficult by the need to reform the tax
                        system in the interests of long-term economic <pb xml:id="pg_589" n="589"
                            facs="0619"/>growth. Inevitably, many of the changes necessary to reduce
                        the barriers to growth will lead to a loss of revenue in the years
                        immediately following their adoption.</p>
                    <p>24. Any additional revenue will have to be secured by new taxation on a broad
                        base.</p>
                    <p>25. The present high level of the Government debt further complicates the
                        financial and economic problems of the country. Substantial additional
                        borrowing could come only from sources which would be inflationary.</p>
                    <p>26. There is no precise level or duration of government expenditures which
                        can be determined in advance, at which an economic system will be seriously
                        damaged from inflationary borrowing on the one hand or from repressive
                        taxation on the other. The higher the level of expenditures, the greater is
                        the need for sound policies and the greater are the dangers of
                        miscalculations and mischance. These dangers are now substantial.</p>
                    <p>27. The requirements for funds to maintain our national security must thus be
                        considered in the light of these dangers to our economic system, including
                        the danger to industrial productivity necessary to support military
                        programs, arising from excessive levels of total Government spending, taxing
                        and borrowing.</p>
                    <p>28. Modification of the foregoing fiscal policies to promote long-term growth
                        may be necessitated for a limited period: (1) to deal with short-term
                        cyclical problems or (2) to achieve overriding national objectives that
                        justify departure from sound fiscal policies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation as to U.S. Manpower</p>
                    <p>29. a. The national security programs of the United States rest upon the
                        manpower to operate them, the economy to produce the material for them, and
                        the financial resources to pay for them.</p>
                    <p>b. The qualified manpower annually coming of military age is adequate to
                        carry out our existing military programs. However, the continuing
                        development of more complicated weapons, machines, and devices used by the
                        military greatly increases the need for military manpower possessed of
                        higher skills, and for their better utilization, and emphasizes the need for
                        expanded technical training and retention of technically trained
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>c. Any considerable increase in the need for military manpower would require
                        consideration of:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Broadening the present criteria governing draft

                        <item>(2) Broadening the physical requirements for enlistment, particularly

                        <item>(5) Greater use of civilians for technical maintenance work.</item>

                        <item>(6) Leadership to develop a national response to increased needs,
                            including steps to make military service a matter of patriotic pride and
                            to increase the attractiveness of a military career.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>d. Any decisions on these matters should be made in the light of a
                        comprehensive study, to be submitted to the President by the Office of
                        Defense Mobilization by December 1, on manpower availability under varying
                        assumptions as to the degree and nature of mobilization requirements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Morale</p>
                    <p>30. Support for the necessary security programs, based upon a sound
                        productive system, is ultimately dependent also upon the soundness of the
                        national morale and the political willingness of the country to support a
                        government which it feels is holding the proper balance between the
                        necessary sacrifices and the necessary defense. Accordingly, the American
                        people must be informed of the nature of the Soviet-Communist threat, in
                        particular the danger inherent in the increasing Soviet atomic capability;
                        of the basic community of interest among the nations of the free world; and
                        of the need for mobilizing the spiritual and material resources necessary to
                        meet the Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p rend="center">policy conclusions</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic Problems of National Security Policy</p>
                    <p>31. a. To meet the Soviet threat to U.S. security.</p>
                    <p>b. In doing so, to avoid seriously weakening the U.S. economy or undermining
                        our fundamental values and institutions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nature of the Soviet Threat</p>
                    <p>32. a. With increasing atomic power, the Soviets have a mounting capability
                        of inflicting very serious and possibly crippling damage on the United
                        States. The USSR will also continue to have large military forces capable of
                        aggressive action against countries of the free world. Present estimates
                        are, however, that the USSR will not deliberately initiate general war
                        during the next several years, although general war might result from
                        miscalculation. In the absence of general war, a prolonged period of tension
                        may ensue, during which each side increases its armaments, reaches atomic
                        plenty and seeks to improve its relative power position.</p>
                    <p>b. In any case, the Soviets will continue to seek to divide and weaken the
                        free world coalition, to absorb or win the allegiance of the presently
                        uncommitted areas of the world, and to isolate the United States, using cold
                        war tactics and the communist apparatus. Their capacity for political
                        warfare against the United States as <pb xml:id="pg_591" n="591" facs="0621"
                        />well as its allies will be enhanced by their increased atomic
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>33. a. A sound, strong, and growing U.S. economy is necessary to support over
                        the long pull a satisfactory posture of defense in the free world and a U.S.
                        capability rapidly and effectively to change to full mobilization. The
                        United States should not weaken its capacity for high productivity for
                        defense, its free institutions, and the incentives on which its long-term
                        economic growth depends.</p>
                    <p>b. A recession in the level of U.S. economic activity could seriously
                        prejudice the security of the free world.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Defense Against Soviet Power and Action</p>
                    <p>34. In the face of these threats, the United States must develop and
                        maintain, at the lowest feasible cost, requisite military and nonmilitary
                        strength to deter and, if necessary, to counter Soviet military aggression
                        against the United States or other areas vital to its security.</p>
                    <p>a. The risk of Soviet aggression will be minimized by maintaining a strong
                        security posture, with emphasis on adequate offensive retaliatory strength
                        and defensive strength. This must be based on massive atomic capability,
                        including necessary bases; an integrated and effective continental defense
                        system; ready forces of the United States and its allies suitably deployed
                        and adequate to deter or initially to counter aggression, and to discharge
                        required initial tasks in the event of general war; and an adequate
                        mobilization base; all supported by the determined spirit of the U.S.
                        people.</p>
                    <p>b. This strong security posture must also be supported by an effective U.S.
                        intelligence system, an adequate manpower program, superior scientific
                        research and development, a program of limited defense mobilization,
                        reasonable internal security, and an informed American people.</p>
                    <p>c. Such a strong security posture is essential to counter the Soviet divisive
                        tactics and hold together the coalition. If our allies were uncertain about
                        our ability or will to counter Soviet aggression, they would be strongly
                        tempted to adopt a neutralist position, especially in the face of the atomic
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>35. In the interest of its own security, the United States must have the
                        support of allies.</p>
                    <p>a. The military striking power necessary to retaliate depends for the
                        foreseeable future on having bases in allied countries. Furthermore, the
                        ground forces required to counter local aggressions must be supplied largely
                        by our allies.</p>
                    <p>b. The loss of major allies by subversion, divisive tactics, or the growth of
                        neutralist attitudes, would seriously affect the security of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>36. United States policies must, therefore, be designed to retain the
                        cooperation of our allies, to seek to win the friendship and cooperation <pb
                            xml:id="pg_592" n="592" facs="0622"/>of the presently uncommitted areas
                        of the world, and thereby to strengthen the cohesion of the free world.</p>
                    <p>a. Our allies must be genuinely convinced that our strategy is one of
                        collective security. The alliance must be rooted in a strong feeling of a
                        community of interest and firm confidence in the steadiness and wisdom of
                        U.S. leadership.</p>
                    <p>b. Cooperative efforts, including equitable contributions by our allies, will
                        continue to be necessary to build the military, economic and political
                        strength of the coalition and the stability of the free world.</p>
                    <p>c. Constructive U.S. policies, not related solely to anti-communism, are
                        needed to persuade uncommitted countries that their best interests lie in
                        greater cooperation and stronger affiliations with the rest of the free
                        world.</p>
                    <p>d. To enhance the capacity of free world nations for self-support and
                        defense, and to reduce progressively their need for U.S. aid, the United
                        States should assist in stimulating international trade, freer access to
                        markets and raw materials, and the healthy growth of underdeveloped areas.
                        In this connection, it should consider a modification of its tariff and
                        trade policies.</p>
                    <p>e. In subsequent fiscal years economic grant aid and loans by the United
                        States to other nations of the free world should be based on the best
                        interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>37. a. In Western Europe, a position of strength must be based mainly on
                        British, French, and German cooperation in the defense of the continent. To
                        achieve a stronger Europe, the United States should support, as long as
                        there is hope of early success, the building of an integrated European
                        Community (including West Germany and if possible a united Germany), linked
                        to the United States through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                        United States should press for a strong, united stable Germany, oriented to
                        the free world and militarily capable of overcoming internal subversion and
                        disorder and also of taking a major part in the collective defense of the
                        free world against aggression. The United States must continue to assist in
                        creating and maintaining mutually agreed European forces, but should reduce
                        such assistance as rapidly as United States interests permit.</p>
                    <p>b. In the Far East, strength must be built on existing bilateral and
                        multilateral security arrangements until more comprehensive regional
                        arrangements become feasible. The United States should stress assistance in
                        developing Japan as a major element of strength. The United States should
                        maintain the security of the offshore island chain and continue to develop
                        the defensive capacity of Korea and Southeast Asia in accordance with
                        existing commitments.</p>
                    <p>c. In the Middle East, a strong regional grouping is not now feasible. In
                        order to assure during peace time for the United States and its allies the
                        resources (especially oil) and the strategic positions <pb xml:id="pg_593"
                            n="593" facs="0623"/>of the area and their denial to the Soviet bloc,
                        the United States should build on Turkey, Pakistan and, if possible, Iran,
                        and assist in achieving stability in the Middle East by political actions
                        and limited military and economic assistance, and technical assistance, to
                        other countries in the area.</p>
                    <p>d. In other areas of the free world the United States should furnish limited
                        military aid, and limited technical and economic assistance, to other free
                        nations, according to the calculated advantage of such aid to the U.S. world
                        position.</p>
                    <p>38. a. As presently deployed in support of our commitments, the armed forces
                        of the United States are over-extended, thereby depriving us of mobility and
                        initiative for future military action in defense of the free world.</p>
                    <p>b. Under present conditions, however, any major withdrawal of U.S. forces
                        from Europe or the Far East would be interpreted as a diminution of U.S.
                        interest in the defense of these areas and would seriously undermine the
                        strength and cohesion of the coalition.</p>
                    <p>c. Our diplomacy must concentrate upon clarifying to our allies in parts of
                        the world not gripped by war conditions that the best defense of the free
                        world rests upon a deployment of U.S. forces which permits initiative,
                        flexibility and support; upon our political commitment to strike back hard
                        directly against any aggressor who attacks such allies; and upon such
                        allies’ own indigenous security efforts.</p>
                    <p>39. a. In specific situations where a warning appears desirable and feasible
                        as an added deterrent, the United States should make clear to the USSR and
                        Communist China, in general terms or with reference to specific areas as the
                        situation requires, its intention to react with military force against any
                        aggression by Soviet bloc armed forces.</p>
                    <p>b. (1) In the event of hostilities, the United States will consider nuclear
                        weapons to be as available for use as other munitions. Where the consent of
                        an ally is required for the use of these weapons from U.S. bases on the
                        territory of such ally, the United States should promptly obtain the advance
                        consent of such ally for such use. The United States should also seek, as
                        and when feasible, the understanding and approval of this policy by free
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>(2) This policy should not be made public without further consideration by
                        the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Defense Against the Threat to the U.S. Economy and
                        Institutions</p>
                    <p>40. a. A strong, healthy and expanding U.S. economy is essential to the
                        security and stability of the free world. In the interest of both the United
                        States and its allies, it is vital that the support of defense expenditures
                        should not seriously impair the basic soundness <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594"
                            facs="0624"/>of the U.S. economy by undermining incentives or by
                        inflation.</p>
                    <p>b. The United States must, however, meet the necessary costs of the policies
                        essential for its security. The actual level of such costs cannot be
                        estimated until further study, but should be kept to the minimum consistent
                        with the carrying out of these policies.</p>
                    <p>c. Barring basic change in the world situation, the Federal Government should
                        continue to make a determined effort to bring its total annual expenditures
                        into balance, or into substantial balance with its total annual revenues and
                        should maintain over-all credit and fiscal policies designed to assist in
                        stabilizing the economy.</p>
                    <p>d. Every effort should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and
                        unnecessary overhead in the Federal Government, and to minimize Federal
                        expenditures for programs that are not essential to the national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>e. The United States should seek to maintain a higher and expanding rate of
                        economic activity at relatively stable price levels.</p>
                    <p>f. The economic potential of private enterprise should be maximized by
                        minimizing governmental controls and regulations, and by encouraging private
                        enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g. nuclear
                        power).</p>
                    <p>41. To support the necessarily heavy burdens for national security, the
                        morale of the citizens of the United States must be based both on
                        responsibility and freedom for the individual. The dangers from Soviet
                        subversion and espionage require strong and effective security measures.
                        Eternal vigilance, however, is needed in their exercise to prevent the
                        intimidation of free criticism. It is essential that necessary measures of
                        protection should not be so used as to destroy the national unity based on
                        freedom, not on fear.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reduction of the Soviet Threat</p>
                    <p>42. a. The United States must seek to improve the power position of itself
                        and the rest of the free world in relation to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>b. The United States must also keep open the possibility of negotiating with
                        the USSR and Communist China acceptable and enforceable agreements, whether
                        limited to individual issues now outstanding or involving a general
                        settlement of major issues, including control of armaments.</p>
                    <p>c. The willingness of the Soviet leadership to negotiate acceptable
                        settlements, without necessarily abandoning hostility to the non-Soviet
                        world, may tend to increase over time, if the United States and its allies
                        develop and increase their own strength, determination and cohesion,
                        maintain retaliatory power sufficient to insure unacceptable damage to the
                        Soviet system should the USSR <pb xml:id="pg_595" n="595" facs="0625"
                        />resort to general war, and prove that the free world can prosper despite
                        Soviet pressures, or if for any reason Soviet stability and influence are
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>d. The policy of the United States is to prevent Soviet aggression and
                        continuing domination of other nations, and to establish an effective
                        control of armaments under proper safeguards; but is not to dictate the
                        internal political and economic organization of the USSR.<note n="‡"
                            xml:id="d100fn-sym7">This paragraph does not establish policy guidance
                            for our propaganda or informational activities. [Footnote in the source

                    </p>
                    <p>43. As a means of reducing Soviet capabilities for extending control and
                        influence in the free world, the United States should:</p>
                    <p>a. Take overt and covert measures to discredit Soviet prestige and ideology
                        as effective instruments of Soviet power, and to reduce the strength of
                        communist parties and other pro-Soviet elements.</p>
                    <p>b. Take all feasible diplomatic, political, economic and covert measures to
                        counter any threat of a party or individuals directly or indirectly
                        responsive to Soviet control to achieve dominant power in a free world
                        country.</p>
                    <p>c. Undertake selective, positive actions to eliminate Soviet-Communist
                        control over any areas of the free world.</p>
                    <p>44. a. Measures to impose pressures on the Soviet bloc should take into
                        account the desirability of creating conditions which will induce the Soviet
                        leadership to be more receptive to acceptable negotiated settlements.</p>
                    <p>b. Accordingly, the United States should take feasible political, economic,
                        propaganda and covert measures designed to create and exploit troublesome
                        problems for the USSR, impair Soviet relations with Communist China,
                        complicate control in the satellites, and retard the growth of the military
                        and economic potential of the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>45. In the face of the developing Soviet threat, the broad aim of U.S.
                        security policies must be to create, prior to the achievement of mutual
                        atomic plenty, conditions under which the United States and the free world
                        coalition are prepared to meet the Soviet-Communist threat with resolution
                        and to negotiate for its alleviation under proper safeguards. The United
                        States and its allies must always seek to create and sustain the hope and
                        confidence of the free world in the ability of its basic ideas and
                        institutions not merely to oppose the communist threat, but to provide a way
                        of life superior to Communism.</p>
                    <p>46. The foregoing conclusions are valid only so long as the United States
                        maintains a retaliatory capability that cannot be neutralized by a surprise
                        Soviet attack. Therefore, there must be <pb xml:id="pg_596" n="596"
                            facs="0626"/>continuing examination and periodic report to the National

                    <p>1. In the event of war with the USSR we should endeavor by successful
                        military and other operations to create conditions which would permit
                        satisfactory accomplishment of U.S. objectives without a predetermined
                        requirement for unconditional surrender. War aims supplemental to our
                        peace-time aims should include:</p>
                    <p>a. Eliminating Soviet Russian domination in areas outside the borders of any
                        Russian state allowed to exist after the war.</p>
                    <p>b. Destroying the structure of relationships by which leaders of the
                        All-Union Communist Party have been able to exert moral and disciplinary
                        authority over individual citizens, or groups of citizens, in countries not
                        under communist control.</p>
                    <p>c. Assuring that any regime or regimes which may exist on traditional Russian
                        territory in the aftermath of a war:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Do not have sufficient military power to wage aggressive
                            war.</item>
                        <item>(2) Impose nothing resembling the present iron curtain over contacts
                            with the outside world.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>d. In addition, if any Bolshevik regime is left in any part of the Soviet
                        Union, insuring that it does not control enough of the military-industrial
                        potential of the Soviet Union to enable it to wage war on comparable terms
                        with any other regime or regimes which may exist on traditional Russian
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>e. Seeking to create postwar conditions which will:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Prevent the development of power relationships dangerous to the
                            security of the United States and international peace.</item>
                        <item>(2) Be conducive to the successful development of an effective world
                            organization based upon the purposes and principles of the United
                            Nations.</item>

                        <item>(3) Permit the earliest practicable discontinuance within the United
                            States of wartime controls.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. In pursuing the above war aims, we should avoid making irrevocable or
                        premature decisions or commitments respecting border rearrangements,
                        administration of government within enemy territory, independence for
                        national minorities, or post-war responsibility for the readjustment of the
                        inevitable political, economic, and social dislocations resulting from the

                    <p>Top Secret</p>
                    <p>I have just had a meeting (4:00 to 6:00 p. m.) with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, Secretary <persName

                        necessary security and still reduce the Defense budget for ’55.</p>
                    <p>Statement by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                        >Dulles</persName>:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>He believes that we <hi rend="italic">should begin to withdraw ground
                                troops from Korea</hi>. This for the reason that we should show
                            confidence in our air and naval strength; and should avoid ground
                            deployments in Asia. (If this were done, we could afford substantial
                            reduction in Army active strength.) <persName>Dulles</persName> stated
                            that a week or more ago General <persName corresp="#p_HULLGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> recommended that we <hi rend="italic"
                                >initiate,</hi> now, the withdrawal of American ground troops from
                            Korea. (No one else at the conference knew anything about this
                            recommendation.)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It was agreed that:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. In view of the above and the conviction that some of our service
                            and support units in Europe could be somewhat skeletonized, the Army’s
                            recommendation for 1, 500, 000 individuals in ’55 would <hi
                                rend="italic">not,</hi> in the absence of some marked change in the
                            international situation, be approved.</item>
                        <item>b. It was agreed that the dependence that we are placing on new
                            weapons would justify completely some reduction in conventional
                            forces—that is, both ground troops and certain parts of the Navy.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In any event, the conclusion of the conference was that we should move
                        towards a reduction in personnel in the armed services, <pb xml:id="pg_598"
                            n="598" facs="0628"/>especially Army and possibly Navy. This may mean,
                        very soon, some reduction of the actual numbers of divisions in Korea. In
                        Europe and in the United States it was felt that we should, in all services,
                        effect some savings in number of individuals, especially in overhead and
                        supporting units. The reduction of divisions in Europe should be constantly
                        studied; but the State Department is to explore matter with Allies.</p>

                    <p>Top Secret</p>
                    <p>Some question has been raised as to the interpretation of certain paragraphs
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 <note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2"
                            >Dated Oct. 30, <ref target="#pg_577">p. 577</ref>.</note> dealing with
                        our capabilities in Western Europe, the function of our forces there, and
                        future developments as to U.S. forces in that area. The questions arise in
                        paragraphs 15 and 34.</p>
                    <p>The first interpretation is this: Neither the forces we now have nor any
                        forces we are likely to put there, together with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces, can be expected to defend successfully the land
                        areas of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies if the Soviet
                        Union makes an all-out invasion of Western Europe. The function of U.S.
                        forces in Western Europe is the same as that of the U.S. forces in Berlin—a
                        political function, assuring both friend and enemy that any attack on that
                        area automatically produces a war to the death with the U.S. Our present
                        deployment in Europe is excessive and should be reduced, since the forces
                        necessary to provide requisite assurance to friend and enemy are less than
                        those now deployed. U.S. ability to sustain the Free World is strengthened
                        by withdrawing forces from exposed salients on the periphery and retaining
                        them in positions from which flexibility of use can be assured. It is the
                        job of the State Department to make palatable to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> the withdrawal of some U.S. forces now in Europe, even
                        though it is recognized that at the present time such withdrawal would be
                        very unpalatable indeed.</p>
                    <p>The second interpretation is this: The mission of U.S. forces in Europe is to
                        assist in giving to Europe the capability of defending <pb xml:id="pg_599"
                            n="599" facs="0629"/>the land area of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> allies. U.S. forces in Europe are not now capable of
                        performing that mission. Therefore U.S. forces not only should not be
                        withdrawn from Europe, but should be strengthened. Western Europe is a
                        critical area which the U.S. must defend. Any reference to withdrawal of
                        peripheral forces does not include U.S. contributions to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>This conflict of interpretation exists. It is desirable that it should be
                        resolved if effective planning is to take place in the Department of
                        Defense. There is a real possibility that forces and strategy will be
                        determined by compromising the concept—i.e. “agreeing” upon forces that are
                        half-way between those that are necessary under the first interpretation and
                        those that are necessary under the second.</p>

                    <p>In introducing this report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> outlined the reasons why Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> had desired the National
                        Security Council to endorse <pb xml:id="pg_600" n="600" facs="0630"/>the
                        assumptions, and the considerable difficulties which the Planning Board had
                        encountered in framing them. Specifically, he pointed out that it had been
                        impossible to agree in the Planning Board on the wording of the third
                        assumption, dealing with the probable length of a future global war. He also
                        pointed out the Planning Board’s view that if the Council adopted these
                        assumptions as a basis for detailed <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                        mobilization plans, such detailed plans would themselves be subject to
                        subsequent review. Lastly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> pointed out the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        that final action on the present report should not be taken at this meeting.
                        On the other hand, if no action were taken, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> would have to fall back on
                        prior sets of assumptions which presumably had even less validity than those
                        now set forth.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> then expressed
                        appreciation for the contribution made by the Planning Board in its
                        formulation of these assumptions. He also indicated awareness of the
                        difficulty of fixing now on long-term assumptions, and agreed that the
                        assumptions set forth in the present report should be considered as interim
                        in character. Nevertheless, since some kind of guidance was now essential
                        for the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, he expressed the hope that the
                        Council would adopt the present assumptions as guidance to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> in the formulation of its plans and
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff were at the moment engaged in a reappraisal of
                        U.S. military strategy. Accordingly, the mobilization assumptions could
                        hardly be valid until this reappraisal was completed. For that reason he
                        wished to go on record as supporting the suggestion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that the Council postpone action on the
                        present report.</p>

                            >Flemming</persName>, although quite prepared to revise these
                        assumptions when the Joint Chiefs had completed their new strategic plan,
                        insisted that in the meantime he must have reasonable assumptions which
                        would enable him to get his programs in shape to take before the Congress
                        when it met in January.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that greater progress might be made if the Council
                        addressed itself to the specific assumptions in the report and particularly
                        those which appeared to involve a disagreement.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_601" n="601" facs="0631"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reiterated that the
                        chief disagreement related to paragraph 3, which assumed that if global war
                        broke out it would last four years or a period up to four years.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that it was of course very difficult to make even an
                        educated guess as to how long such a war would last, and that it was also
                        desirable to look at this question again after the Joint Chiefs had
                        completed their job. Meanwhile, however, he could perceive no particular
                        objection to the assumption that such a global war would last “up to four
                        years”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that
                        the trouble lay in the length of time, since the longer we assume the war
                        will last the more we will be inclined to spend in order to prepare for its
                        prosecution.</p>
                    <p>The President took issue on this point with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, and said that it was quite
                        possible that the most expensive war to prepare for was the one which would
                        last only a few months, because in that case you would have to have
                        everything in readiness in advance of the war to assure its successful
                        prosecution. He certainly didn’t want <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Arthur Flemming</persName> to spend $300 million on stockpiling some
                        material or other if $50 million would do the job.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> illustrated the
                        President’s generalization by reference to the stockpiling program, and also
                        pointed out that prior acts of assumptions with regard to the length and
                        character of a global war involving the United States had never taken
                        account adequately of the massive damage which this country might suffer
                        from an enemy atomic attack. For this reason if for no other, it was
                        desirable to have the Council act on the present assumptions rather than to
                        compel him by default to fall back on earlier and more unrealistic
                        assumptions.</p>
                    <p>While the President took no issue on this point, he did indicate his hope
                        that the Council, in dealing with the problem of the character and duration
                        of the war, would take into consideration the blow which our own atomic
                        capability could deliver against the enemy. As he had pointed out before,
                        said the President, our estimates of the enemy’s capabilities always tend to
                        overlook what the United States was capable of doing to the enemy. From this
                        point the President launched into a discussion of the stake of the civilian
                        in the economy of the United States in the event of another global war. He
                        expressed himself as convinced that American civilians would undergo a
                        regime of austerity unprecedented in their history. He was certain, for
                        example, that in order to solve our manpower problems it would be necessary
                        to conscript women. That was a subject about which many people had views,
                        but very few were willing to express them publicly, owing to the political
                        repercussions.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_602" n="602" facs="0632"/>
                    <p>With respect to paragraphs, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> offered the opinion that as drafted the language
                        suggested that it was possible to make a scientific estimate with regard to
                        the length of the war. Of course, no such scientific estimate was possible,
                        and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> thought the
                        difficulty could be overcome if paragraph 3 were introduced by a statement
                        indicating that you were merely suggesting four years of war as a means of
                        planning for stockpiles. Indeed, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, he was not at all sure that a
                        future war, in which we were ranged against both the USSR and Communist
                        China, would not last for even ten years. It could end up with such complete
                        political disintegration of the world as to make a stable peace
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        the view that paragraph 3 did not actually constitute an attempt to estimate
                        how long a future global war would last. It was, rather, an estimate as to
                        how long a war we should be prepared to plan. Could anyone, he asked, guess
                        what we would be in a position to do at the conclusion of two years of
                        global war in the future? In short, a two-year period was probably the
                        utmost that you could realistically plan for, and it was his recommendation
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> formulate
                        his programs on a two-year basis.</p>
                    <p>Expressing agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> stated that if we had on hand all the materials we
                        needed to prosecute a war for a period of two years, we would be able to
                        turn in a very good performance. If a longer period were envisaged,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> was afraid that
                        we would now spend our money for the wrong things.</p>
                    <p>The President did not, however, agree with Secretaries <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. As it seemed to him, the
                        problem boiled down to telling the Office of Defense Mobilization to rely to
                        the greatest possible extent on measures that we could take after the war
                        had started, as well as on measures and materials which would be needed
                        prior to the outbreak of the war. For these reasons, he still believed that
                        the phraseology “up to four years” was as reasonable as one could
                        expect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called the
                        Council’s attention to the concern of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the
                        statement in paragraph 4, which suggested that war could be initiated
                        without warning. On the contrary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that if
                        the Soviets deliberately initiated global war, they would have to undertake
                        measures to prepare for this event which they could not disguise from us.
                        Accordingly, we would have some kind of warning of their plans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, however, said
                        that he had been unable to agree with the position taken by the Joint Chiefs
                        if it ruled out the possibility <pb xml:id="pg_603" n="603" facs="0633"/>of
                        a Soviet sneak attack which would have no advance warning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then outlined the
                        comment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to paragraph 5, as to the
                        character and destruction to be anticipated from a nuclear attack in a
                        global war. The Joint Chiefs believed that the language in the present
                        paragraph 5 made the worst possible case and was too pessimistic an
                        assumption for planning purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> commented that at
                        least the paragraph should make some reference to the damage which the
                        United States would be able to inflict on the Soviet Union in order to
                        present a reasonable case.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, however, stated
                        that this strengthened his already-expressed view of the inadequacy of the
                        present set of assumptions. He felt that a new group of individuals, like
                        those originally called together for the Solarium project, <note n="3"
                            xml:id="d103fn3">For information on Project Solarium which culminated in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 153/1 of June 10, 1953, see the
                            memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, May 9,

                        give this thing a whole new look”.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, pointed out to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> that the authors of this
                        paragraph had had all the advantages of the findings of the Bull Committee
                        with respect to the very problem in paragraph 5.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> also thought
                        that the present language was much too pessimistic and black-and-white. If
                        one really believed the statement in paragraph 5, it would be his duty to
                        advocate the immediate dispersion of our entire industrial plant.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that of
                        course if it was taken out of context paragraph 5 did create an unduly
                        alarming picture, but he insisted that pararaph 5 was expected to be read in
                        the context of the other paragraphs in the paper, and particularly in
                        relation to paragraph 14.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> supported Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s position by pointing
                        out that according to the basic estimate in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                    <p rend="center">(Subject to review by the National Security Council early in
                        1954)</p>
                    <p>In fulfilling their defense mobilization responsibilities, agencies will plan
                        on the following interim assumptions:</p>
                    <p>1. There will continue to be a long period of tension with possible local
                        aggressions not involving full scale U.S. military action. Global war is
                        possible at any time, but its occurrence on Soviet initiative is considered
                        to be unlikely in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 (the period covered by current
                        estimates). Estimates for the subsequent period are more uncertain.</p>
                    <p>2. In the event of global war, the enemy will include the USSR, the Soviet
                        Satellites and Communist China.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_606" n="606" facs="0636"/>
                    <p>3. While global war may last for an extended period up to four years,
                        planning for its duration should be based upon all assumptions herein
                        stated, with particular emphasis on paragraph 14.</p>
                    <p>4. Global war may be initiated without warning, or may be preceded by local
                        hostilities or other events requiring stepped-up mobilization.</p>
                    <p>5. Global war will involve nuclear attack on and massive destruction to
                        selected major urban areas of the United States wherein our principal
                        Government centers and a large portion of our productive capacity and
                        population are located. Global war will also involve substantial damage by
                        nuclear attack on or sabotage to military and key industrial facilities not
                        located in major urban areas. Large scale attacks and sabotage will take
                        place on selected important European and other free world critical
                        industrial areas, and on U.S. and allied overseas bases. In evaluating the
                        effect of the damage to the free world, described in the three preceding
                        sentences, appropriate weight will be given to the damage which will be done
                        by the free world to the enemy and its resources.</p>
                    <p>6. Total wartime demand on the economy will be larger than can be supported
                        in terms of production (including transportation and power) and manpower.
                        Under full mobilization, manpower (the total labor force) will be one of the
                        seriously limiting resources even assuming maximum utilization.<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d104fn-sym1">A plan is being developed indicating the range and
                            phasing of the military take of production and manpower after meeting
                            minimum essential civilian needs. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. During the war period, the United States will be a substantial net
                        supplier of military and non-military material to its allies.<note n="*"
                            target="d104fn-sym1">A plan is being developed indicating the range and
                            phasing of the military take of production and manpower after meeting

                        However, it will be a net importer from certain areas, notably South
                        America.</p>
                    <p>8. War will be fought by the United States as part of an alliance which will
                        be more highly integrated and at least initially more extensive than that of
                        World War II, and the industrial capacity and manpower of our allies will be
                        used to the maximum extent possible.</p>
                    <p>9. War will involve initial denial of several areas of the free world to the
                        United States and its allies.</p>
                    <p>10. Shipping losses will be high in the first year of the war but will
                        diminish later in the war.</p>
                    <p>11. Before war or a period of increased tension begins, the U.S. economy will
                        be operating at high levels but with somewhat greater unemployment than at
                        present. Capacity and production will be at higher levels than at
                        present.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_607" n="607" facs="0637"/>
                    <p>12. When increased tension threatens to create a scramble for resources and
                        serious inflationary pressures, production and stabilization controls will
                        be imposed.</p>
                    <p>13. Global war will result in the reduction of civilian living standards
                        below those in World War II, but because of the need for post-attack
                        restoration of minimum living standards, total civilian requirements may be
                        temporarily larger at times.</p>
                    <p>14. The capacity, adaptability and ingenuity of American industry will enable
                        it, after a period of recovery, partially to offset the loss of capacity and
                        sources of supply resulting from enemy action. Because the initial shock of
                        such action will paralyze some sections of industry, other sections will be
                        forced to produce for recovery rather than for immediate war time needs, and
                        deliveries of weapons and military equipment and supplies will be curtailed
                        for a considerable period thereafter.</p>
                    <p>15. Barring basic change in the world situation, materials and facilities
                        deficiencies will decline so that by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954 existing controls can be dropped.</p>
                    <p>16. The present Universal Military Training and Service Act will be continued
                        for the period short of global war. Following the initiation of global war,
                        this Act will be drastically amended in accordance with a plan being
                            developed.<note n="‡" xml:id="d104fn-sym7">A plan is being developed

                    <p>1. Paragraph 39b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d105fn2">Dated Oct. 30, <ref target="#pg_577">p.
                            577</ref>.</note> (Basic National Security Policy) provides, in part,
                        that “in the event of hostilities, the United States will consider nuclear
                        weapons to be as available for use as other munitions.” In approving <gloss

                        be promptly taken “to conform existing arrangements regarding atomic weapons
                        to subparagraph 39b.” (Action 944c) <note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">For <gloss

                        matter, the Special Committee, composed of State, Defense, and <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> brought to light the existence of
                        differences of opinion between State and Defense as to the meaning of
                        paragraph</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_608" n="608" facs="0638"/>
                    <p>39b. Accordingly, the two Departments were requested to prepare memoranda for
                        the President regarding their views.</p>
                    <p>2. The Department of State had understood that the purpose of paragraph 39b
                        was primarily to permit the military to make plans on the basis of the
                        availability of nuclear weapons. It also agrees that, as a corollary,
                        custody of atomic weapons should in large part be transferred from the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>3. The Department of State, however, does not construe paragraph 39b to be a
                        present decision that atomic weapons will, in fact, be used in the event of
                            <hi rend="italic">any</hi> hostilities. In its opinion, the decision to
                        use atomic weapons will necessarily involve the gravest political and
                        foreign policy aspects. For example, in cases of limited hostilities, it
                        will be essential to consider whether the use of atomic weapons will widen
                        the hostilities, lose the support of Allies, or increase the danger of
                        strategic use of atomic weapons by the enemy.</p>
                    <p>4. In our opinion, the President should decide these issues from case to case
                        in the light of the actual circumstances. Undoubtedly it will be possible to
                        isolate certain cases where the use of such weapons would be virtually
                        automatic. Obviously, in the event of an atomic Pearl Harbor there would be
                        no question of our use of atomic weapons in retaliation. With the
                        development of tactical atomic weapons it may also be possible to identify
                        in advance certain kinds of tactical use which would be authorized in
                        reacting to aggression.</p>
                    <p>5. The State Department position, however, is that these issues have not been
                        decided by paragraph 39b. They can and should be further explored to

                        Elements Constituting National Security</p>
                    <p>1. The survival of the free world depends upon the United States maintaining:
                        (a) sufficient strength, military and non-military, to deter general war, to
                        prevent or counter aggression, and to win a general war if it is forced upon
                        us; and (b) a sound, strong economy, capable of supporting such strength
                        over the long pull and of rapidly and effectively changing to full
                        mobilization.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_612" n="612" facs="0642"/>
                    <p>2. a. The strength of the United States which must be so maintained is an
                        integrated complex of offensive and defensive elements. Each of these
                        elements has its proper role in the defense of the vitals of America against
                        attack and destruction. For example, our existing commitments to help in
                        creating outposts of indigenous strength in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries and in the Orient contribute to the defense of
                        the continental United States as well as does the development of an early
                        warning system in the Western Hemisphere. Accordingly, each element of this
                        integrated complex should be in proper balance with all the other elements.
                        We shall not have satisfactory over-all strength if one element is allowed
                        to develop out of proportion to the other elements.</p>
                    <p>b. Just as there must be a proper balance among the several elements
                        comprising our strength, there must also be a proper balance between
                        military and non-military measures within the element of “continental
                        defense”.</p>
                    <p>3. In recent years we have emphasized the elements of peripheral defense,
                        offensive capabilities, and mobilization base more than we have emphasized
                        the element of “continental defense”. Yet this latter element is necessary
                        for the protection of our vitals and for the survival of our population and
                        our Government in the event of attack. “Continental defense” is now clearly
                        inadequate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scope of This Report</p>
                    <p>4. Because there are many interrelated programs which affect the defense of
                        the continental United States in various ways it is necessary, before
                        considering the element of “continental defense”, to decide which programs
                        are to be included in and excluded from such consideration. As used herein
                        the term “continental defense” is limited by the following:</p>
                    <p>a. There are included in this report those elements contributing to the
                        defense of the continent which are of an essentially defensive nature.
                        Accordingly, this report does not include those elements of offensive
                        strength of the United States and its allies which contribute materially to
                        the defense of the continent.</p>
                    <p>b. There are included in this report certain existing programs which,
                        although contributing to the defense of the continent, are not undertaken
                        primarily for that purpose and would be carried on in any event by the
                        agencies responsible for them. Examples of such programs are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) Personnel security in the Executive Branch of the Federal
                            Government.</item>
                        <item>(2) Physical security of government facilities.</item>
                        <item>(3) Coastal escorts and coastal anti-submarine patrol.</item>
                        <item>(4) Various elements of an integrated program of counter-measures for
                            the detection and prevention of clandestine introduction and detonation
                            of atomic weapons, such as <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>
                            investigations, border patrol, customs and immigration procedures,
                            passport and visa control, etc.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_613" n="613" facs="0643"/>
                    <p>Conversely, many of the “continental defense” programs will make a valuable
                        contribution to other programs. For example, the air control system can
                        increase civil air traffic capacity and reduce accidents. Some non-military
                        programs will be very useful in handling domestic disasters. Some military
                        forces which would perform roles in the “continental defense” program could
                        be deployed overseas in the latter stages of a war.</p>
                    <p>This report is designed primarily to fix a timing and guidelines which should
                        govern the various “continental defense” programs. Details of the programs
                        in this report will be determined by the responsible departments and
                        agencies.</p>

                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The USSR has now a growing capability to deliver a devastating
                            atomic attack on the United States. (par. 9, p. 4)</item>
                        <item>(2) Our current atomic offensive capability is a most significant
                            deterrent to Soviet atomic attack upon the continental United States. It
                            will continue to be a powerful factor in deterring hostile military
                            action by the USSR. In any program of national security, our offensive
                            capability must be maintained not only for gaining our war objectives,
                            but for its marked deterrent value in protecting our homeland. (par. 10,
                            p. 4)</item>
                        <item>(3) The present continental defense programs are not now adequate
                            either to prevent, neutralize or seriously deter the military or covert
                            attacks which the USSR is capable of launching, nor are they adequate to
                            ensure the continuity of government, the continuity of production, or
                            the protection of the industrial mobilization base and millions of
                            citizens in our great and exposed metropolitan centers. This condition
                            constitutes an unacceptable risk to our nation’s survival. (par. 11, p.
                            4)</item>
                        <item>(4) The creation of a defense system approaching invulnerability is
                            probably unattainable and, as found by the Kelly Committee, is
                            completely impractical, economically and technically, in the face of
                            expected advances in Soviet offensive capabilities. However, a
                            reasonably effective defense system can and must be attained. Such a
                            system must be phased to meet the changing character of the <pb
                                xml:id="pg_614" n="614" facs="0644"/>threat, and therefore fixed
                            programs extending over a period of many years are unsound. Relatively
                            short-term programs should be embarked upon now to achieve as rapidly as
                            possible an ability to cope with the manned aircraft and
                            submarine-launched guided missile threat as it probably will exist
                            through 1957. (Enclosure A, par. 3, p. 50.)</item>
                        <item>(5) No acceptable degree of over-all defense readiness is provided in
                            programs recommended in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159 until
                            about 1956. But the Continental Defense Committee concluded that, during
                            the period 1956 to about 1960, the USSR would not have the net
                            capability of destroying the war-making capacity of the United States,
                            provided:</item>

                            <item>(a) The over-all continental defense programs recommended in
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159 are carried out
                                vigorously, and</item>
                            <item>(b) In the military area, the defense system not only is kept
                                modern, but the quantity of its weapons is increased consistent with
                                any significant increase in the size or performance of the Soviet
                                long range air force. This condition might obtain well into the
                                1960’s. Sometime after 1960, due to the possible development of long
                                range air-to-ground or ground-to-ground guided missiles, there can
                                be no assurance that the proposed programs will give the high degree
                                of protection required. Unless our defensive system is constantly
                                reviewed and kept thoroughly modern, including a defense against
                                such possibilities as an intercontinental ballistic missile, we face
                                the possibility of having our continental defense program largely
                                nullified. However, any doubt about the future must not prevent us
                                from meeting the urgent requirements of the present, (par. 120, pp.

                    <p>6. a. The Soviet demonstration of thermonuclear capabilities in August, 1953,
                        subsequent to the above Reports, indicated that: (1) the Soviets have
                        developed a method of substantially increasing the total energy yield from
                        their available supplies of fissionable materials, enabling them to increase
                        the number of bombs of 30–100 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> yield now
                        estimated to be in their stockpile, or to make their weapons individually
                        more destructive, or to create very high yield weapons (500–1000 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>) by accepting a reduction in total number of
                        weapons; and (2) the Soviets may have reached an advanced stage in the
                        development of true thermonuclear weapons yielding more than a million tons
                        of TNT energy equivalent.</p>

                        outlined in pars. 5 and 6 above. In December 1952, the United States adopted
                        a policy that an early warning system deemed capable of providing three to
                        six hours of warning of aircraft approaching the United States from any
                        likely direction of attack should be developed and made operational as a

                        effort to bring its total annual expenditures into balance, or into
                        substantial balance, with its total annual revenues.</p>
                    <p>b. In financing increased emphasis on “continental defense”, full weight must
                        be placed upon new factors which have entered on the scene since the United
                        States undertook the commitments supporting some of the elements other than
                        “continental defense” in our integrated complex. These new factors are the
                        rapid approach of the Soviets to a stockpile of “atomic plenty” and the now
                        undoubted possession by the Soviets of a thermonuclear device.</p>
                    <p>c. “Continental defense” being but one element of an integrated complex of
                        national security programs, any future major changes in total funds
                        available for such integrated complex, or in the requirements of any major
                        element thereof, will necessitate a re-examination of all U.S. security
                        programs.</p>

                    <p>9. Although the USSR has a growing capability to launch an aggressive attack
                        on the United States, we believe it unlikely that the Kremlin will
                        deliberately initiate general war during the period covered by current
                        estimates (through the end of 1957). However, it is possible that general
                        war might result from miscalculations by either side as a result of a series
                        of actions and counteractions not intended by either side to have that
                        result. Moreover, despite Soviet “peace offensives” and similar moves, there
                        is no substantial reason to believe that the USSR has altered its basic
                        hostility to the free world and its ultimate objective of dominating the
                        world. Accordingly, plans for improving at home the defense of our vitals
                        should proceed in a rapid and orderly fashion.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Improved Foreign and Domestic Intelligence</p>
                    <p>11. In view of the implications of nuclear weapons in the hands of the Soviet
                        Union, greater knowledge of Soviet capabilities and intentions is essential
                        for military and non-military measures to reach maximum effectiveness.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Agreements with Canada</p>
                    <p>12. Canadian agreement and participation on an adequate scale is essential to
                        an effective continental defense system. U.S. efforts should be constantly
                        directed towards maintaining with Canada a common appreciation of the
                        urgency and character of the threat to U.S.-Canadian security, and reaching
                        prompt agreement on the measures required to meet it. The United States
                        should be prepared to agree that Canada take leadership in developing parts
                        of the system and contribute to its expense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Research and Development</p>
                    <p>13. Adequate support for coordinated programs of basic and applied research
                        and development is essential to gain and maintain the required technological
                        superiority over the USSR. Weapons development by us has acquired even
                        greater importance with the development by the USSR of a thermonuclear
                        capability. Basic and applied research must keep abreast of the changing
                        Soviet threat, including intercontinental ballistic guided missiles.</p>

                    <p>The inclusion of the latter three programs in this subparagraph is based
                        solely on their contribution to continental defense, without regard to their
                        importance to other national security functions.</p>
                    <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Early Warning System</hi>. The longer an effective
                        advance warning of enemy attack on the continental United States, the more
                        successfully can many military and non-military measures be carried out. In
                        fact, certain steps—such as emergency dispersal of urban populations—would
                        be impossible without effective advance warning.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Certain important military and non-military measures require prompt
                            provision of at least two hours’ effective early warning. It is urgently
                            necessary for the United States and Canada to decide as soon as
                            practicable upon equipment operationally capable of assuring such early
                            warning and as soon thereafter as possible to install and put in
                            operation the Southern Canadian Early Warning Line and to complete the
                            early warning provided by the Alaskan Command and the U.S. Northeast
                            Command Aircraft Control and Warning systems.</item>
                        <item>b. Seaward extensions of this line to Hawaii and the Azores, beginning
                            with a wing outward from Argentia, should be provided primarily by
                            picket ships and early warning aircraft operating under a patrolling
                            schedule capable of maintaining effectiveness under sustained operating
                            conditions. The primary functions of the seaward barrier are to provide
                            early warning of air attack to the Continental United States and to
                            detect and report the passage of submarines. Forces engaged in early
                            warning barrier operations should have a corollary use in the provision
                            of weather information, search and rescue services, and air and surface
                            surveillance for protection of convoys and, if ordered, should be
                            capable of controlling intercepts of aircraft and conducting limited
                            anti-submarine warfare within the area of operations. The phasing of the
                            program is designed to give initial emphasis to the provision of early
                            warning for the northeastern part of the United States, and should be in
                            consonance with progress on the Southern Canadian Early Warning Line and
                            U.S. operational experience. Considering that it is not feasible to
                            establish an absolute defense against air attack, <pb xml:id="pg_620"
                                n="620" facs="0650"/>development of the seaward extensions should be
                            weighed against the increasing Soviet capability so as to provide a
                            reasonable early warning of air attack through the most probable sea
                            approaches.</item>
                        <item>c. A longer warning than will be afforded by installing the Southern
                            Canadian Early Warning Line is presently desirable and, in view of
                            anticipated increases in speed of aircraft, will probably be required
                            within the next few years. If a Northern Canadian Early Warning Line is
                            deemed feasible and agreed to by Canada and the United States, it should
                            be installed as soon as practicable. Project Corrode should be carried
                            forward with the greatest feasible speed.</item>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Identification and Control Systems</p>
                    <p>17. a. Even with effective early warning, fighter control is impracticable
                        without accurate means of identification and contiguous radar coverage to
                        seaward of our coastline. Therefore, an increase of identification
                        capabilities, such as through the utilization of Consolan radio stations,
                        single and multiple corridor procedures and the extension to seaward of
                        contiguous radar coverage, should be completed with the same urgency as the
                        provision of early warning.</p>
                    <p>b. As aircraft identification systems and contiguous radar coverage are
                        completed, they should be supplemented during the next two years, insofar as
                        practicable, with programs such as:</p>

                    <p>18. a. The recent Soviet thermonuclear test brings home that it is essential
                        with all practicable speed substantially to augment the capability to
                        destroy attacking aircraft and submarines before reaching their targets. All

                        adequate forces with aircraft and missiles which will achieve a high “kill
                        ratio” before the enemy attack reaches our borders. These forces must be
                        built up in a phased and orderly manner to a level which can be maintained
                        and continuously be kept modern with new aircraft and missiles to keep pace
                        with anticipated increases in Soviet capabilities. This process is essential
                        to achieve the objective of this policy. Moreover, some of these forces
                        deployed initially for continental defense could be of great value in other
                        areas and roles in the event of a long war. To <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621"

                    <p>b. In developing the forces and weapons required under these programs, every
                        effort should be made to achieve maximum utilization of existing equipment
                        and forces based upon continuous evaluation of the disposition of U.S.

                        wartime functions of the Executive Branch should be completed with the
                        utmost urgency. Within the next two years, an emergency plan should be

                        light of the Soviet nuclear threat should be emphasized during the next two
                        years:</p>

                        mobilization plans as affected by the development of a Soviet nuclear

                        referred to the “Special Annex”, which gave details with respect to the

                        were based upon a scrutiny of the latest intelligence available on Soviet

                    <p>When he reached paragraph 14, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> informed the Council that the report on organization
                        for continental defense referred to in this paragraph would presently be
                        completed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>,
                        would thereafter be submitted to the Planning Board, and scheduled for
                        consideration by the Council on March 4.</p>
                    <p>Turning to a series of charts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> explained to the Council the significant changes
                        which this revision made in the three major programs listed as 15–a and
                        15–b. He explained that there had been some concern expressed at the
                        meetings of the Planning Board as to whether the change of title with
                        respect to these programs, from completion “with all possible speed” to
                        completion “with all practicable speed”, indicated an intention to slow down
                        the completion of these programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> did not think this was the case, and pointed out that
                        the present revised statement reflected, as the Council directed, the
                        presentations by the Department of Defense of the three major programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> also noted with respect
                        to these programs that the policy called for developing as rapidly as
                        practicable the operational capability of the installations required by the
                        Southern Canadian line, and once this operational capability had been
                        established, to install the line as rapidly as possible. The majority of the
                        Planning Board had agreed that this constituted a reasonable procedure.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0656"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then referred to a
                        letter which he had received from Dr. DuBridge, <note n="6" xml:id="d109fn6"
                            >Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, President of California Institute of Technology.
                            The letter has not been found.</note> Chairman of the Science Advisory
                        Committee of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> (copy filed in the minutes
                        of the meeting). He read two paragraphs from this letter, in which Dr.
                        DuBridge contended that the present level of technological development was
                        sufficiently advanced to permit the installation of the Southern Canadian
                        defense line and the seaward extensions of this line by the dates originally
                        contemplated last September, and that no delay need be contemplated because
                        of the fear that rapid technological advance in the future would render the
                        installations obsolete. With respect to the points made by Dr. DuBridge, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> referred to the
                        statement at the top of page 12 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408,
                        to the effect that the programming projected in the “Special Annex” and the
                        Financial Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408 “is not
                        intended to preclude a more rapid phasing or earlier completion of the early
                        warning and other programs.” Accordingly, said Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, there were no fixed dates for
                        the completion of the programs, nor had the Department of Defense given any
                        indication of a desire to slow down or that lack of funds was a
                        consideration with respect to the pace at which these programs were to be
                        completed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then explained that
                        beyond paragraphs 15–a, –b, –c and –d, the revised report contained few
                        changes of any significance. He did, however, wish to call attention to the
                        only dissent in the paper, which had been presented by the Federal Civil
                        Defense Administration with respect to the Northern Canadian early warning
                        line. He explained the complexity of the problem, and expressed the opinion
                        that the language proposed by <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> in
                        paragraph 16–c was rather too finite in dealing with a problem about which,
                        as yet, we could know very little.</p>
                    <p>When no questions were forthcoming after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>’s detailed analysis, he invited Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> to comment on the revised
                        report.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> stated his belief
                        that the revision constituted an excellent paper on the whole, and that it
                        helped greatly to clarify the issues. He had no changes to suggest in the
                        wording of the report, but he wished to stress the importance of the
                        introductory sentences to paragraph 16, which pointed out the urgency of
                        obtaining as soon as possible effective advance warning of enemy attack.
                        Many agencies were dependent upon provision of early warning in carrying out
                        their responsibilities, and the more clearly we recognized the importance of
                        this objective, the better. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> went on to state his understanding that the joint
                        committee, <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0657"/>made up of officials of
                        the Royal Canadian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force, would report their
                        findings with regard to the Southern Canadian line about June 1,<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d109fn7">Documentation on the joint U.S.-Canadian Air Force
                            committee under reference is scheduled for publication in <ref
                                target="frus1952-54v06p1">volume VI</ref>.</note> and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> recommended that once this
                        report was in, the Council would be well advised to take a fresh look at the
                        early warning problem and not to regard the present dates for completion of
                        the early warning program as frozen. Provided, therefore, the Council
                        clearly understood that no completion dates were fixed and that the Council
                        might look at this issue again, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> concluded that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5408 was “a fine document”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained that the work
                        of the joint committee referred to by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> involved the development of military criteria, the
                        testing of equipment, and the surveying of the Southern Canadian line.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWININGGNF1">Twining</persName> indicated that
                        everything within the committee’s area of responsibility was moving forward
                        as rapidly as possible.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed an interest in Dr. DuBridge’s letter, and inquired
                        whether Dr. DuBridge meant that equipment for the Southern Canadian line now
                        available was sufficiently effective so that, even if no better equipment
                        were to be developed in the near future, we could still install a
                        practicable and effective Southern Canadian line.</p>
                    <p>The President’s question was answered by Assistant Secretary of Defense
                            <persName corresp="#p_QUARLESDA1">Quarles</persName>, who said he
                        believed that the President’s interpretation of Dr. DuBridge’s meaning was
                        substantially correct, but that Dr. DuBridge did not mean that presently
                        available equipment could not be improved upon.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the installation of the line should certainly not be
                        delayed if all we contemplated was a gradual and steady improvement in the
                        effectiveness of the equipment installed. But he did not want us to find
                        ourselves in a position of being compelled to rip out equipment because it
                        proved worthless or ineffective after installation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> called the Council’s
                        attention to the study of the Administration’s continental defense policy
                        and program which had been made, at the behest of a Senate Committee headed
                        by Senator <persName corresp="#p_SALTONSTALL1">Saltonstall</persName>, by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Sprague</persName>. The latter found
                        himself in complete agreement with this program, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> indicated that this was a welcome
                        endorsement by an intelligent outsider competent to make a judgment.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>’s
                        earlier comments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName>
                        said he merely wished to state that the Department of Defense <pb
                            xml:id="pg_628" n="628" facs="0658"/>was accustomed to get done as
                        rapidly as possible any task which the National Security Council directed
                        that department to perform. Referring again to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Sprague</persName>’s report, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said that this report raised
                        certain problems. It was originally intended to be used only by Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_SALTONSTALL1">Saltonstall</persName>’s committee,
                        but it was now proposed to give wide distribution to what was called a
                        “sanitized” version. Great care must be exercised in scrutinizing any report
                        on this subject which reached a large number of people.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1">Strauss</persName> then said he
                        wished to raise a point with respect to paragraph 8–b on page 8 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408, which stated that the Soviets now
                        possessed a thermonuclear device “of quality indicating the use of
                        independent technology.” Admiral <persName corresp="#p_STRAUSSLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> said that he was unable “to buy” this last phrase.
                        Our intelligence was not sufficiently sure to permit this judgment as to the
                        manner in which the Soviets had developed their device. He accordingly
                        recommended deletion of this phrase, and the Council concurred in this
                        recommendation.</p>

                    <p>Before Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> had
                        completed his statement, the President interrupted to say that he had a good
                        many comments to make about this problem, since he was snowed under with
                        complaints over the abandonment of various Government facilities in
                        different parts of the country. While we were all sitting here around this
                        table and talking about dispersing Government agencies, we never seemed to
                        pay any attention to the fact that a number of the facilities which we were
                        abandoning over such violent protests, particularly military installations,
                        might usefully serve a dispersion program. The President stated with great
                        emphasis that we should use such abandoned installations for dispersion
                        purposes unless it could be proved beyond reasonable doubt that these
                        installations were unusable. Furthermore, said the President, he seriously
                        doubted that lack of communications was a valid argument for confining the
                        relocation of Government agencies to an area within 30 miles of Washington.
                        With the use of telephonic communications it should be perfectly possible to
                        relocate many of these agencies a thousand miles away from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> explained to the
                        President that <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> was already taking a look
                        at the abandoned Government facilities, for example, Camp Pickett. Should
                        we, inquired Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>,
                        adopt as a fixed procedure scrutiny of such abandoned facilities before any
                        plans were made for the construction of new installations in connection with
                        the relocation program?</p>
                    <p>The President indicated approval of this suggestion, and asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> if the Budget Bureau had a list
                        of Government facilities and installations which had been abandoned. Some
                        way must be found, the President repeated, to make use of these
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                        was his guess that if the Government issued clear instructions as to the
                        desirability of looking first at existing buildings and installations, we
                        would not have to spend a nickel for any new construction.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that it was an American habit to expect too much
                        luxury in its Government buildings. As an old Army man, he himself had
                        shared in this failing, but it was now obvious to him that a lot more could
                        be done on an austere basis. If we merely used common sense we could save a
                        lot of money.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DODGEJM1">Dodge</persName> then suggested that the
                        procedure suggested by the President and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>, as to looking first at the
                        possibilities of using existing facilities, be incorporated in the Defense
                        Mobilization Order.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said that he agreed
                        with this suggestion, but believed that after Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> had included this point in
                        his next draft, the Order be looked at by the Planning Board before coming
                        to the Council for a final decision. As presently written, the Order <pb
                            xml:id="pg_631" n="631" facs="0661"/>would cause certain difficulties
                        for the Department of Defense and quite possibly for other Government
                        agencies, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1">Kyes</persName> said
                        he wished an opportunity to have these problems aired.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KYESRM1"
                            >Kyes</persName>’ statement moved him to remind the Council of his views
                        on its functions. He said that he wanted every member of the Council, both
                        statutory and invited, to feel absolutely free to bring up any idea they
                        wished for discussion at this table. As soon as possible, however, a written
                        report on such a subject should be prepared and put through the Planning
                        Board before the Council gave it final consideration. Freedom to discuss
                        should not imply hasty decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then referred to the
                        President’s desire, expressed at the previous meeting, for the preparation
                        of maps to illustrate target areas and communications facilities. General
                        Paul then produced three maps, which he stated he was prepared to explain to
                        the President and the Council. The first one, he said, dealt with possible
                        sites for the permanent relocation program. This constituted what General
                        Paul described as a “blow-up” of the Washington area, and the sites were
                        included on circles with radii of 30, 100, and 300 miles from the District
                        of Columbia.</p>
                    <p>After General Paul had commented on the first map, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired whether the sites
                        indicated on the map called for the use of old buildings or whether they
                        involved new construction. General Paul reassured Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> that it was proposed to
                        utilize anything in the way of facilities which were available and usable.
                        To this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        replied that you would have to go a lot further afield than 300 miles if you
                        were to find suitable facilities already in existence sufficient to satisfy
                        the need for permanent relocation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> then said that he
                        wished to make clear that the indications on the map were to portray
                        groupings of Government agencies rather than actual location of sites.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, General Paul produced his second map, which was to indicated
                        sites for emergency relocation of Government agencies as opposed to
                        permanent nearby relocation. With respect to this second map, General Paul
                        indicated that four Government agencies had been assigned sites for
                        emergency relocation in the midst of the critical target area. Sooner or
                        later these sites would have to be changed.</p>
                    <p>General Paul then turned to his third map, which portrayed the basic
                        communications network of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether such a map did not indicate that any time you
                        relocated a Government agency adjacent to one of these communications lines,
                        that agency could function just as effectively as though it were located ten
                        miles from Washington. In <pb xml:id="pg_632" n="632" facs="0662"/>any case,
                        said the President, it was perfectly plain to him that we could not plan to
                        relocate all these agencies in areas close to Washington.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> asked the
                        President whether his statement indicated a belief that the previous limit
                        of 300 miles from the District of Columbia for permanent nearby relocation
                        should be abandoned in favor of more distant relocation. The President
                        replied that he certainly did mean this, provided adequate communications
                        facilities existed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then stated that in his
                        opinion the next step in carrying out the plan for continuity of essential
                        wartime functions was for the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> to make a
                        general determination as to the essential wartime functions in all the major
                        departments and agencies of the Executive Branch.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>, however,
                        indicated that it was not his intention to make such a general determination
                        involving all the agencies, but to carry out the program on a case-by-case
                        basis. He indicated that he would be ready presently to discuss the
                        essential wartime functions of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and
                        would thereafter provide other cases. This seemed to him, he said, the best
                        way to get at a set of ground rules.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> replied that it was his
                        understanding that the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> was to select the
                        units and cadres which were to perform essential wartime functions in all
                        the agencies, in order to determine what cadre or unit in what department
                        should be relocated outside of the District of Columbia. This task, said Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, seemed obviously to
                        be the first one.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>, however, repeated
                        his previous position, and noted that CAA was the “guinea pig” right now. We
                        would then go on, case by case, until we could formulate a general
                        program.</p>

                    <p>This special estimate was prepared at the request of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board. It is concerned solely with
                        Soviet gross capabilities for attack on the continental U.S. and does not
                        consider how these capabilities might be reduced by Allied
                        counteractions.</p>
                    <p>The Intelligence Advisory Committee concludes that the USSR’s greatest
                        capability lies in open military attack with nuclear weapons delivered by
                        long-range aircraft. Present Soviet capabilities for air attack on
                        continental U.S. are limited by dependence on the TU–4 bomber (B–29
                        equivalent), by the apparent lack of a developed inflight refueling
                        capability, and by the relatively undeveloped character of the Chukotski and
                        Kola base areas. Nevertheless it is estimated that the USSR has sufficient
                        nuclear weapons, long-range bombers, and suitable bases to enable it to
                        attack virtually any target in continental U.S. on one-way missions. (You
                        may wish to look over the maps at the end of the estimate which illustrate
                        the range of Soviet bomber aircraft.)</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that in 1954 the USSR, by a maximum effort, could launch
                        about 300 aircraft from the Chukotski and Kola areas, 200 to 250 of which
                        might reach their targets. By the end of 1957 it could launch a maximum of
                        about 1000 aircraft in an initial air operation against the U.S. This would
                        require the employment of the entire Soviet heavy and medium bomber force
                        and might result in 450 to 700 mission aircraft reaching their targets.</p>
                    <p>This special estimate will not be released to any foreign government.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the members of
                        the Council, and explained that the Planning Board believed that a policy on
                        United States objectives <pb xml:id="pg_636" n="636" facs="0666"/>in the
                        event of war was desirable to provide a basis for planning by the
                        appropriate departments and agencies. He pointed out that the present
                        statement had been unanimously approved by the Planning Board, but as yet
                        the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not been received.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been unable to agree on their views, and he
                        therefore requested that the Council postpone action on this statement for
                        one week.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that we could anticipate in the aftermath of a
                        third world war a tremendous swing toward isolationism in the United States.
                        Moreover, the colossal job of occupying the territories of the defeated
                        enemy would be far beyond the resources of the United States at the end of
                        such a war. While the President therefore said he agreed that it was right
                        to keep this problem of war objectives in mind, he believed that the chaos
                        resulting from a third world war would be so great as to render it
                        impossible for the National Security Council to determine in advance our
                        precise objectives and courses of action in the event of such a war.</p>
                    <p>As regards the kind of government we would attempt to set up in a defeated
                        Russia, the President said it was hard to debate. A totalitarian system was
                        the only imaginable instrument by which Russia could be ruled for a
                        considerable interval after the war. By and large, concluded the President,
                        the main purpose served by this paper was to emphasize how vital it was to
                        avoid a third world war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D. Jackson</persName> referred to
                        paragraph 9–a of the report, calling for mobilization of our material, moral
                        and human resources, as “wishy-washy”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained that this
                        statement had been inserted because we had not fully mobilized our human
                        resources in World War II and that we should certainly be aware of the
                        necessity of doing so in any future world war.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed the view that if a third world war were to begin with
                        an enemy atomic attack on the United States, this country would itself be
                        required to accept a totalitarian regime. There would be no way to avoid it,
                        and this was another argument for doing our best to prevent such a war.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council of
                        the problem which the Planning Board believed its present report on war
                        objectives would serve. It met the need to provide the military with a
                        general basis on which to develop war plans, and it also provided guidance
                        for the prosecution of the cold war by the psychological warfare planners.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                        previous statement of U.S. war objectives had been written back in 1948 and
                        that the many changes, notably in the development of atomic weapons, since
                        that time required reconsideration of this policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then referred to the
                        split views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to this paper. One
                        position had been taken by the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss>, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Commandant of
                        the Marine Corps. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        briefly summarized this view. A different position had been taken by the
                        Chief of Naval Operations and the Chief of Staff of the Army. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> also summarized this position.
                        He then suggested that, before hearing <pb xml:id="pg_639" n="639"
                            facs="0669"/>the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he understood that
                        the Secretary of State wished to comment on the paper.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                        a general observation to make. It seemed to him a danger that the present
                        paper, which was supposed to develop U.S. objectives in a war against the
                        Soviet bloc, was becoming confused with the question of ways and means of
                        achieving such objectives. Was this paper actually designed to produce a
                        review of the previous decisions of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        with respect to basic security policy and strategy?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that this was not
                        the intention of the Planning Board, and that the paper had no other purpose
                        than to replace the old annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2,
                            <note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">For text of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 162/2, including the two-page annex entitled “U.S.
                            Objectives Vis-à-vis the USSR in the Event of War”, see p. 577.</note>
                        which set forth U.S. objectives in the event that a war was forced upon us
                        by the Soviet Union. In that case, replied Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, the State Department was
                        prepared to accept the paper as it stood.</p>
                    <p>After reading the first eight paragraphs of the draft in order to clarify the
                        nature of the problem and the purpose of the paper, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> invited Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> to comment on the split
                        views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said that the
                        Chief of Staff of the Air Force and he felt that the present draft provided
                        adequate guidance with respect to planning for the contingency envisaged.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, however, believed
                        that the paper suffered from two very serious deficiencies. The first of
                        these, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>,
                        related to paragraph 3, <note n="6" xml:id="d113fn6">Paragraph 3 of the
                            draft statement on “U.S. Objectives in the Event of General War With the
                            Soviet Bloc”, prepared by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Planning Board on Feb. 19, and designated <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5410, reads: “To reduce by military and other measures
                            the capabilities of the USSR to the point where it has lost its will or
                            ability to wage war against the United States and its allies.”</note>
                        which Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> and
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> desired to
                        revise in order to define more precisely the degree to which measures
                        necessary to achieve victory over the Soviet bloc should be carried out.
                        Quoting from the portions of the memorandum which set forth the views of
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated their fear that
                        full exploitation of our nuclear capability might inflict such chaos and
                        destruction and suffering in the Soviet Union as had not been known in
                        Europe since the end of the Thirty Years War. Indeed, in the circumstances
                        it was impossible to visualize how the United States could cope with the
                        victory it might achieve over the Soviets, or how it might hope to establish
                        a workable occupational regime. In sum, any proposed assault upon the
                        capabilities of the USSR to wage war ought to be evaluated in terms both of
                        its possible <pb xml:id="pg_640" n="640" facs="0670"/>contribution to
                        victory and in the light of the limiting factors discussed above.</p>
                    <p>As for himself, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>
                        felt that the views of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1"
                            >Carney</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> should not have been directed to a paper dealing
                        with U.S. objectives in the event of war with the Soviet Union, but instead
                        should have been directed toward current basic national security policy as
                        set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2. The changes proposed
                        by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> were in fact
                        introduced in order to effect a change in our basic military planning and
                        strategy, and it confused the issue to criticize the war objectives
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>The second major area of disagreement by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> occurred in paragraph 9–f.
                            <note n="7" xml:id="d113fn7">Paragraph 9–f of the draft statement reads:
                            “While avoiding premature decisions or commitments, commence formulation

                            and other developments in ways favorable to U.S. post-war
                            objectives.”</note> As presently written, they believed (and Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> again quoted from
                        the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum) that political planning
                        should not be delayed until the outbreak of war, but should instead be
                        initiated as far in advance as possible. It was further necessary to point
                        up the necessity for determining in greater detail and more precisely how
                        the United States and its allies intend to enforce the terms of peace and to
                        exercise physical control over the Soviet bloc. After quoting these views,
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed his
                        own opinion that it was impractical to attempt detailed advance planning
                        with respect to political warfare and the post-hostilities settlement.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>’s statement, the President, with considerable
                        vehemence and conviction, expressed the opinion that the subjects that
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> had discussed
                        came pretty close to the area of prerogatives of the Commander-in-Chief. He
                        said he was speaking very frankly to the Council in expressing his absolute
                        conviction that in view of the development of the new weapons of mass
                        destruction, with the terrible significance which these involved, everything
                        in any future war with the Soviet bloc would have to be subordinated to
                        winning that war. This was the one thing which must constantly be borne in
                        mind, and there was little else with respect to war objectives that needed
                        to worry anyone very much. The President said that ten years ago he might
                        very well have subscribed to the limitations and restrictions which the
                        Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations now recommended
                        with regard to the exploitation of our great <pb xml:id="pg_641" n="641"
                            facs="0671"/>atomic capabilities. But in the present situation it was
                        impossible and impractical even to consider these suggestions. In
                        illustration of his point, the President turned to paragraph 1 of the draft
                        report, which read: “To achieve a victory which will ensure the survival of
                        the United States as a free nation and the continuation of its free
                        institutions in the post-war period.” This, said the President, he would
                        change by putting a period after “victory” and deleting the rest of the
                        paragraph, if not the rest of the paper. We can’t tell what we will do after
                        we achieve a victory in what will be total and not in any sense limited
                        warfare. Accordingly, he disagreed, said the President, with the limitations
                        and qualifications suggested by the Planning Board, just as he disagreed
                        with the restrictions and limitations suggested by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> in their comments on this
                        report.</p>
                    <p>Again to illustrate his views, the President referred to the strike in the
                        coal fields which had been called by John L. Lewis <note n="8"
                            xml:id="d113fn8">John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine
                            Workers.</note> at the end of 1942 or in the early part of 1943. That
                        such a strike was possible in the midst of a terrible war was to be
                        explained only by the fact that the United States was a free nation. We
                        could never, however, tolerate such a development in any war we envisaged
                        with the Soviet Union. Obviously we were desperately anxious to maintain our
                        free institutions, and we were anxious to help our friends and allies
                        abroad, but we were in no position to count on it or plan on it, in view of
                        the catastrophic nature of the third world war if it should come. In such a
                        war the United States would be applying a force so terrible that one simply
                        could not be meticulous as to the methods by which the force was brought to
                        bear. He could assure the Council, said the President, that with respect to
                        any decision he might be obliged to make regarding a war plan, his decision
                        would be based on his judgment of just how much such a war plan would hurt
                        the enemy. For the time being, at least, no other considerations would be of
                        significance. This, of course, did not mean that he would exclude from his
                        judgment the question of how much harm or hurt the United States itself
                        would suffer as a result of the methods chosen to prosecute the war. It was
                        quite appropriate to keep this consideration in mind. The President
                        concluded by admitting that his point of view might seem brutal, but in view
                        of the fact that we would never enter the war except in retaliation against
                        a heavy Soviet atomic attack, he simply could not conceive of any other
                        course of action than the course of action which would hit the Russians
                        where and how it would hurt most.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then raised the
                        question as to whether the President and the other members of the Council
                        believed that there was any <pb xml:id="pg_642" n="642" facs="0672"/>value
                        whatsoever in attempting to set forth U.S. objectives in the event of global
                        war with the Soviet bloc. The paper was by no means hogwash. It had been
                        most carefully worked over, not only as a basis for war planning, but as a
                        guide to propaganda and cold war programs in the near future, as was
                        indicated by paragraphs 6 and 8 <note n="9" xml:id="d113fn9">
                            <p>Paragraphs 6 and 8 of the draft statement read:</p>
                            <p>“6. To insure that postwar regimes in the former enemy territories
                                will not follow totalitarian and aggressive policies and practices
                                that would threaten the security and freedom of other peoples.”</p>
                            <p>“8. To facilitate postwar development of an international
                                organization composed of the United States and friendly nations (and
                                ultimately a world organization) which will have sufficient power
                                and authority to enforce a just, peaceful and secure international
                                order.”</p>
                        </note> and by paragraph 9–f, which set forth the principle of
                        non-predetermination with respect to terms of surrender, border and
                        territorial arrangements, and the forms of administration of government in
                        enemy territory, the independence of national minorities, etc.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the paragraph dealing with post-war organization, the
                        President expressed skepticism as to whether any nations as we now know them
                        would continue to exist at the conclusion of this war, and whether we or any
                        other nations would be in a position to create the post-war organization
                        called for in this paragraph. The President said that, of course, his
                        imagination as to the horrors of a third world war might be overdeveloped,
                        but he believed that every single nation, including the United States, which
                        entered into this war as a free nation would come out of it as a
                        dictatorship. This would be the price of survival.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out
                        that the present report said as much as this in paragraph 9–a, which called
                        for the full mobilization of the moral, human and material resources of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his
                        agreement with the President’s doubt as the practicality of any discussion
                        of the post-war organization. Its character would depend on the kind of
                        world that existed when the war was over. It was accordingly utterly
                        academic to discuss such a subject in this paper.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that in spite of his own views, the present report
                        might be very useful to Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> and to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STREIBERTTC1">Streibert</persName> for propaganda
                        and cold war purposes. That was one thing, but of course quite different
                        from providing a basis for war plans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> replied that a good
                        example of the paper’s concern with the cold war was provided in paragraph
                        9–f, which stressed nonpredetermination with regard to the fate of the enemy
                        territories <pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0673"/>as opposed to the call
                        for unconditional surrender in the second world war. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> whether he believed the
                        paper would be of any use to the war planners in the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JACKSONCD1">C.D.
                            Jackson</persName> stated that he simply wouldn’t know what to do with
                        the paper if it were sent to him as guidance for the cold war. It seemed to
                        him “dream stuff, and there was no conceivable way of implementing it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out
                        that if paragraphs 6 and 8, dealing with the post-war situation and events
                        subsequent to a U.S. victory, were deleted, the rest of the paper was
                        self-contained and made good sense. The President expressed agreement with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s
                        suggestion, and Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> added that of course a point might come in the
                        course of the war when victory for the United States and its allies would be
                        in sight, at which time the objectives set forth in the paper might prove
                        useful guidance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> proposed that the
                        Council adopt the suggestion made by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, and the President
                        expressed his tentative approval and indicated his willingness to talk to
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> about their views,
                        as expressed in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum, at any
                        time they wished. It was pointed out that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_CARNEYARB1">Carney</persName> were present and prepared to
                        discuss their views, but the President replied that there were also too many
                        other people present on this occasion.</p>

                        Bloc</p>
                    <p>(Assumes that general war has been forced upon the United States, directly or
                        indirectly. Reference to territory of the Soviet Union means the area
                        included within the August, 1939, borders.)</p>
                    <p>1. To achieve a victory which will insure the survival of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>2. To preserve and retain as many of its effective allies as possible.</p>
                    <p>3. To reduce by military and other measures the capabilities of the USSR to
                        the point where it has lost its will or ability to wage war against the
                        United States and its allies.</p>
                    <p>4. To prevent, by all means consistent with other U.S. objectives, the active
                        participation of Communist China in the war on the USSR side. Failing this
                        objective, to reduce by military and other measures the capabilities of
                        Communist China to the point where it has lost its will or ability to wage
                        war against the United States and its allies.</p>
                    <p>5. To render ineffective the control structure by which the Soviet arid
                        Chinese Communist regimes have been able to exert ideological and
                        disciplinary authority over individual citizens or groups of citizens in
                        other countries.</p>
                    <p>6. To prevent, so far as practicable, the formation or retention, after the
                        war, of military power in potentially hostile states sufficient to threaten
                        the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>7. In pursuing the above objectives, the United States should from the outset
                        of general war:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Mobilize fully its moral, human and material resources.</item>
                        <item>b. Obtain the full participation of its principal allies in the
                            collective war effort.</item>
                        <item>c. Seek the participation in or contribution to the collective war
                            effort by other nations, as consistent in each case with attainment of
                            the above objectives.</item>
                        <item>d. Divide, as practicable, the peoples and armed forces of the Soviet
                            Union and Communist China from their communist regimes, and the peoples
                            of the satellites from their Soviet-dominated regimes; and so far as
                            possible enlist the active support of these peoples on the side of the
                            United States and its allies in prosecuting the war against the Soviet
                            regime.</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_646" n="646" facs="0676"/>
                        <item>e. Make clear that this war is not an attempt by the United States to
                            impose by force of arms, a particular political or economic system upon
                            the world, but rather a defense against efforts by the Soviet regime to
                            do so.</item>
                        <item>f. While avoiding premature decisions or commitments, commence
                            formulation of, and keep under continual review, plans with respect to
                            such issues as terms of surrender, border and territorial
                            rearrangements, the forms or administration of government in enemy
                            territory, independence for national minorities, and the degree of
                            post-war responsibility to be assumed by the United States in
                            readjusting the inevitable political, economic and social dislocations
                            resulting from the war; and exert U.S. influence at every opportunity
                            during the war to shape political and other developments in ways
                            favorable to U.S. post-war objectives.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>8. The United States should maintain after the cessation of hostilities, U.S.
                        and allied military strength adequate to achieve postwar objectives. <note

                                Effects of Increasing Nuclear Capabilities Upon the Policies of US
                                Allies</hi>

                    <p>1. The Intelligence Advisory Committee adressed this estimate to the probable
                        effect upon the policies of the principal US allies of a general conviction
                        that the US and the USSR each had acquired nuclear capabilities more than
                        sufficient to cripple the other.</p>
                    <p>2. Under such circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>
                        concluded that US allies will:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(a) probably seek to obtain greater influence over US policy, in order
                            to ensure a cautious and non-provocative attitude toward the Communist
                            states;</item>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_647" n="647" facs="0677"/>
                        <item>(b) be even more insistent than at present that every effort be made
                            to limit the scope and area of local conflicts, and be more unwilling
                            than at present to participate in repelling local Communist
                            aggression;</item>
                        <item>(c) almost certainly support the position of the US in the event of
                            international crisis involving grave danger of general war, as long as
                            they believe that firm maintenance of the alliance will probably avert
                            war.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> found itself unable to estimate
                        the probable courses of action of US allies if an international crisis
                        should develop to the point where general war seemed to them virtually
                        certain and no longer to be averted by firm maintenance of the alliance. The
                            <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> believes that most allied
                        governments, if confronted with certain national destruction as the sole
                        alternative to an accommodation with the USSR, would choose the latter. It
                        believes it unlikely, though possible, that the major allies of the US would
                        become convinced that the alternatives facing them were so limited and so
                        clear-cut as those described.</p>

                                transmitted a memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                which stated, in part, that “In view of the fact that <gloss

                                considerable concern has been expressed at the idea of a substantial
                                review of this policy at this time. On the other hand, it is
                                desirable to provide more specific guidance for the preparation
                                during the forthcoming summer of the budgets of the various
                                departments and agencies for Fiscal Year 1956. Therefore, with the
                                approval of the President, the approach to this project will be
                                focused, not on a reconsideration of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 162/2 as such, but rather on the development of

                                which would govern our national security programs for Fiscal Year

                    <p>a. The internal stability of the Soviet Union and its control of the European
                        satellites have not diminished and may be expected to remain intact through
                        1959.</p>
                    <p>b. However, the Soviet bloc is faced with internal problems such as popular
                        discontent in the satellites, agricultural shortages and <pb xml:id="pg_650"

                        the collective leadership and serious defections from the secret
                        services.</p>
                    <p>c. Communist China has gained prestige more rapidly than anticipated; its
                        power will continue to increase. Despite potential conflicts of interest,
                        the present close Sino-Soviet collaboration will persist.</p>

                            Subversion and Local Aggression</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. Present and future Soviet Bloc capabilities for pursuing their objectives
                        by action short of general war appear at least as great as, and possibly
                        greater than, a year ago. Throughout most of the free world the Communists
                        have the capability through hardcore activists to engage in a wide variety
                        of disruptive tactics, ranging from organized civil war (as in Indochina)
                        through persistent guerrilla activities (as in Malaya) to inflammatory
                        demonstrations, propaganda, “popular fronts”, and parliamentary harassment.
                        Preferring a “creeping expansion” over resort to overt aggression, they will
                        continue to take over spontaneous movements bred of nationalistic fervor or
                        economic discontent and to exploit free world disunity.</p>
                    <p>b. In the period through 1959, the Soviet rulers will almost certainly
                        believe that, as Soviet nuclear capabilities increase, the aversion of the
                        U.S. and of its allies to general war will correspondingly increase, and
                        that the Kremlin will therefore have greater freedom to take certain actions
                        without running substantial risk of general war. It may employ the threat of
                        nuclear devastation as an instrument of political warfare. It may attempt to
                        gain some of its objectives by local military actions, calculating that the
                        U.S. and its allies will be more anxious than before to keep such local
                        conflicts from expanding into general war. The Kremlin will, however,
                        continue to be extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in which the
                        USSR would be subjected to nuclear attack. At the same time, the Kremlin
                        would probably not be deterred by the risk of general war from taking
                        counteraction against an action by the U.S. or its allies which the Kremlin
                        considered an imminent threat to Soviet security. The extent to which the
                        Kremlin uses the increased freedom of action which its increased nuclear

                        and prior to like achievement by the Soviets. The U.S. [is expected] [should

                        atomic capability of inflicting critical damage upon U.S. and other allied
                        targets, however, there could result a condition of mutual deterrence to
                        [the deliberate initiation] [actions materially enhancing the risk] of
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>b. Free World forces will be confronted with quantitative superiority in
                        ground and tactical air forces in the geographical areas contiguous to the
                        Soviet Bloc. However, the superior tactical atomic support which can be
                        provided our Allies during this period will, if accepted by them, partially
                        offset Allied deficiencies in conventional forces. Taken as a whole,
                        effectiveness of European forces is considered fair to good. There has been
                        no progress in forming West German forces and limited progress in forming
                        Japanese forces. Events in Indochina have resulted in a suspension of
                        planned re-deployments from the Far East. D-day <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> commitments of U.S. forces in Europe remain unchanged. No
                        progress has been made in forming a strategic reserve based generally on
                        U.S. territory, with a high degree of combat readiness and a capability of
                        being moved to any threatened area.</p>

                    <p>a. There have been serious instances of an unwillingness of important free
                        world nations to take concerted action which the U.S. considers necessary to
                        oppose communist expansion, particularly as regards Indochina, East-West
                        trade, and <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. West Germany is becoming
                        restive because of protracted delay in recovering its sovereignty. The
                        long-term alignment of Japan with the free world is less certain. The
                        situation with respect to Indochina has deteriorated with unexpected
                        rapidity, confronting the free world with the possible loss of Southeast
                        Asia to communism.</p>
                    <p>b. The alliances of the free nations will continue to be strained by divisive
                        forces and conflicts of interests which will be vigorously exploited by the
                        USSR. In particular, unity of action will be impaired by:</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                    <p>7. With the growth both in Soviet nuclear capabilities and in the power of
                        nuclear weapons themselves, in the period 1956–59, a total war involving the
                        strategic use by both sides of nuclear weapons would bring about such
                        extensive destruction as to threaten the survival of Western civilization
                        and the Soviet regime.</p>
                    <p>8. Under these circumstances, the freedom of either side to initiate the use
                        of strategic nuclear bombing against the other may be circumscribed by:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The fear of the effects of retaliatory use of such strategic
                            bombing; and</item>
                        <item>b. The possibility that neither side would gain a [net] [decisive]
                            military advantage from such an exchange of nuclear blows.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>9. This situation could create a condition of mutual deterrence in which both
                        sides would be strongly inhibited from [deliberately initiating] [actions
                        materially enhancing the risk of] general war.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prevention of Soviet Nuclear Attack</p>
                    <p>10. To ensure Soviet fear that strategic nuclear attacks upon the U.S. would
                        be followed by the nuclear devastation of the USSR, the U.S. must maintain
                        the striking forces necessary for such retaliation.</p>
                    <p>11. Even if this is done, however, the deterrent to Soviet strategic nuclear
                        attack would be eroded if the Kremlin came to believe that it could, through
                        surprise nuclear strikes, destroy U.S. retaliatory capacity.</p>

                        active and passive continental defense programs should be carried out to
                        reduce [to manageable proportions] the damage and casualties likely to
                        result from such attack.</p>

                                practicable arrangement for the limitation of armaments with the
                                USSR. Such an arrangement would be a more certain and economical
                                method of meeting the threat posed by the growing Soviet nuclear

                                paper. The U.S. should therefore continue to reexamine its position
                                on disarmament, especially (1) whether a system of safeguards can be
                                devised entailing less risk for U.S. security than no limitation of
                                armaments and (2) whether the U.S. should be willing to agree to
                                effective nuclear disarmament in the absence of conventional

                                achieved, so long as the Soviet regime and objectives remain

                            <cell>In the face of possible nuclear balance in 1956–59, there is
                                serious question whether the U.S., while maintaining maximum
                                strategic nuclear capabilities, can continue to place major reliance
                                thereon as a means of waging general war. Consequently, the U.S.
                                should undertake to increase the forces and mobilization potential
                                which the U.S. and its allies would need to wage war effectively
                                without strategic use of nuclear weapons.</cell>
                            <cell>Despite the advent of nuclear balance, the U.S. must accept the
                                risks involved in relying upon strategic nuclear capabilities as a
                                means of waging general war, and must employ its scientific knowhow
                                and industrial superiority to maintain qualitative advantage over
                                the Soviets. The U.S. must continue to make clear its determination
                                to meet Soviet attack with all available weapons. Only in this way
                                can there be a maximum deterrent to general war, which if it comes
                                will in all probability involve the unrestricted use of nuclear

                        in the arms race. Therefore a sustained effort must be made to invent and
                        develop capabilities which will provide decisive preponderance to U.S.

                        political reasons (including susceptibility of the local government to
                        atomic blackmail) or military reasons (exposure to immediate destruction by

                    <p>18. U.S. policy to deter or defeat overt Communist aggression will be
                        accomplished, in part, by the programs described above to maintain and
                        enhance the U.S. capability to wage general war. This capability will
                        continue to be a deterrent to identifiable overt aggression so long as the
                        Communists believe that such aggression could eventually lead to general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>19. As a nuclear balance is approached, however, the wisdom and necessity of
                        avoiding general war will become increasingly apparent to both sides. Under
                        such circumstances, the Communists may believe that the U.S. would be
                        unlikely to respond to certain local aggressions by initiating general war.
                        Accordingly, the U.S. should be prepared to defeat such aggressions without
                        necessarily initiating general war. To accomplish this result will require
                        the use of a U.S. strategic reserve and indigenous defense forces,
                        supplemented as required by U.S. forces and logistical support. However, the
                        Communists must be convinced of U.S. determination to take [, unilaterally
                        if necessary,] whatever action its security position requires, even to the
                        extent of general war.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Expansion Other Than by Overt
                        Aggression</p>
                    <p>20. Aided by their increasing nuclear capabilities, especially as a state of
                        atomic balance with the U.S. is approached, the Communist powers are likely
                        to pursue a strategy of further expansion through subversion, indirect
                        aggression, and the instigation or exploitation <pb xml:id="pg_659" n="659"
                            facs="0689"/>of civil wars in free world countries, as in Indochina. The
                        advantages of such a strategy, if successful, lie in the continued
                        accretions to Communist strength and prestige and the progressive weakening
                        of the free world coalition, both politically and militarily, while the
                        involvement of the main sources of Communist power is avoided. This Soviet
                        threat of piecemeal conquest can be countered only by an integrated and
                        flexible combination of political, military, economic and psychological
                        actions participated in by many nations and given determined leadership by
                        the United States. In view of the threatened loss of Indochina, the U.S.
                        cannot possibly accept further significant extension of Communist control;
                        it must act, both in relation to the Communist powers and to the peoples of
                        threatened areas, so as to prevent such extension of control. In particular,
                        the U.S. should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Take political and economic measures to strengthen the countries
                            exposed to such indirect aggression, as indicated in Section III

                            counter the threat of any such groups or forces responsive to Communist
                            control to achieve dominant power in a free world country.</item>
                        <item>d. In instances of civil war, be prepared to take military action in

                            elements under Communist control; [the decision to take such action
                            would depend on all the circumstances existing at the time, including
                            the risk of intervention by Soviet or Chinese Communist forces.]</item>

                    <p>21. The growth of Soviet nuclear power and the increasing destructiveness of
                        nuclear weapons will make our allies more fearful of war and more cautious
                        of action that might lead to war. In the imminence of general war some of
                        them might choose a position of neutrality and default on their alliance
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>22. Factors of division and weakness in the alliance may make it difficult to

                        expansion in the Free World, particularly in Asia.</p>
                    <p>23. Nevertheless, major allies will continue to be essential to the U.S. to
                        prevent the loss to Communist control of major free areas and the gradual

                    <p>24. In these circumstances the U.S. should take action to strengthen the

                    <p>25. The U.S. should attempt to gain maximum support from the free world,
                        particularly from allies and uncommitted countries most interested in the
                        threatened area, for the measures necessary to prevent Communist expansion
                        by direct (paras. 18–19 above) or indirect (par. 20) aggression. Any
                        decision to act without our major allies would be made according to the
                        factors present in the particular situation. As a broad rule of conduct:</p>

                                lasting damage to the alliance. The U.S. cannot afford the loss of
                                major allies unless vital security considerations leave us no

                        Countries</p>
                    <p>33. a. With regard to forces now planned by allied countries with U.S.
                        concurrence, most of these countries will not be able to bear the total
                        costs (local budget and foreign exchange) of bringing such forces to, and of
                        maintaining them at, a high degree of combat effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>b. Present estimates indicate a need from the U.S. for:</p>

                            modernization.</item>
                        <item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Economic aid for military support.</hi> For some
                            countries limited economic aid will also be necessary to support the
                            planned level of forces; this aid can probably decline from the present
                            level in Europe; the level in Asian areas, while apt to remain high, is
                            dependent on current developments.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>c. The levels of U.S. aid cannot be finally determined, however, until
                        judgments are available as to whether there are any changes in the size and
                        degree of effectiveness of allied forces which the U.S. desires and in the
                        extent to which allied countries can meet their needs from their own
                        resources.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV. Mobilization</p>
                    <p>34. The U.S. mobilization potential to provide arms and military equipment
                        consists of (a) active and inactive facilities for military end item
                        production, (b) general industrial capacity, including new supplies of
                        materials, which can be put to defense and defense supporting use and (c)
                        military reserves of end items. The U.S. mobilization potential is stronger
                        than ever before in peacetime.</p>
                    <p>35. The facilities actively producing non-nuclear military end items have
                        declined in number in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954. Under current
                        plans this decline will continue through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1956. Thus the time required to get back into large scale production will be
                        lengthened. This delay may be offset in part by maintaining the production
                        equipment and some of the facilities in the best possible standby or
                        readiness status for future use.</p>
                    <p>36. Although general industrial capacity may be expected to continue to grow
                        during the period ahead, immediately available capacity for many secondary
                        products used either directly or in support <pb xml:id="pg_664" n="664"
                            facs="0694"/>of military production may decline as specialized military
                        demand declines.</p>
                    <p>37. Military reserves of end items have been built up in the past four years.
                        Some items will be further added to reserves in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1955–56. There will be obsolescence of some items in the
                        reserves. This latter trend is accelerated in periods of rapid change in
                        military plans and technology, such as the present.</p>
                    <p>38. The net effect of the factors outlined above appears to be that through
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, our net matériel mobilization
                        potential for meeting the rapid increase in military needs in the early
                        stages of a global war will decline.</p>
                    <p>39. The capacity to produce certain types of military end items (e.g.,
                        aircraft and guided missiles) and certain types of general industrial
                        products (e.g., common components), may not be adequate to meet the
                        requirements of global war.</p>
                    <p>40. In view of the fact that about two-thirds of the general industrial
                        capacity of the country is concentrated in fifty key target areas, its
                        availability in the event of global war must be measured against the
                        increasing capability of the USSR for direct attack on the U.S.</p>
                    <p>41. New weapons, in certain respects, constitute a special problem in
                        relation to industrial capacity. Normally, latent changes accumulate between
                        crises. Introduction of major modifications or entirely new weapons at the
                        onset of war may create a large new demand for capacity in a relatively
                        narrow sector of the industrial system. Where new major weapons are likely
                        to render existing types obsolete, the risk of critical bottlenecks and
                        delays can be minimized by developing facilities and techniques for their
                        production, and by production, as rapidly as economically feasible.</p>
                    <p>42. The advantages of mobilization capacity as opposed to reserves of
                        military end items are generally held to be (1) slower obsolescence rate and
                        (2) lower pre-war cost. For established weapons which have had, and it
                        appears will continue to have, a low obsolescence rate the first advantage
                        is reduced. In light of the increasing Soviet capabilities for direct
                        attack, the war risk of not having the items in adequate quantities must be
                        weighed against the prewar costs. In some cases pre-war procurement of a
                        high proportion of war needs may be indicated.</p>
                    <p>43. Finally, to be meaningful, estimates of the adequacy of the mobilization
                        potential must be set against an agreed and tested set of requirements and
                        factored for probable attack damage.</p>

                    <p>*These figures assume extension of present excise on liquor, tobacco, and
                        gasoline, due for reduction on April 1, 1955, under existing law, which
                        would involve tax losses of $1.2 billion in 1956 and $1.1 billion in 1957.

                        expenditures in excess of receipts could be raised by (a) borrowing; (b)

                        (a) and (b). The decision on the most desirable methods of financing would
                        depend upon other circumstances that might exist or develop. Such
                        circumstances would include the state of the economy, the impact upon it of
                        various contingencies and of other measures which might be put into effect
                        including controls, and the extent to which receipts from existing taxes

                    <p rend="center">Introduction</p>
                    <p>This paper is designed to direct attention to those issues and areas on which
                        U.S. policy should place primary emphasis during the period 1956–59, and to
                        indicate the main lines of action which the U.S. should pursue in regard to
                        these issues or areas.</p>
                    <p>Any such analysis must, of course, start from the Communist threat. Between
                        now and 1959, the Communist bloc will markedly increase its military
                        capabilities, especially nuclear power; will probably maintain its political
                        cohesiveness and stability; and will continue its steady economic growth.
                        During this period the bloc can also be expected to remain hostile toward
                        the West, willing to accept whatever risks and costs seem necessary to
                        maintain its security against the West, and anxious to extend its influence
                        throughout Eurasia by the methods promising the greatest success at the
                        least risk.</p>
                    <p>The Communist bloc’s specific intentions will be largely shaped, however, by
                        the policies of the free world. And its relative capabilities will be
                        significantly affected by the actions which the free world takes to improve
                        its economic, political, and military position.</p>
                    <p>The free world’s posture, in turn, will be largely determined by its
                        reactions to three major forces: increasing East-West nuclear capabilities,
                        unresolved economic problems, and the force of nationalism in certain
                        regions. These forces are discussed in Part I of this paper.</p>
                    <p>Part II of this paper discusses four major policy problems which will face
                        the U.S. during the next five years and which arise at least in part from
                        general trends treated in Part I. These are:</p>

                        <item>a. the nuclear equation;</item>
                        <item>b. U.S. economic leadership;</item>
                        <item>c. the maintenance of independent non-Communist governments in

                    </list>
                    <p>These problems were selected because they seemed likely to be both of
                        critical importance to U.S. security and susceptible of being substantially
                        influenced by U.S. actions which would materially affect budget
                        planning.</p>
                    <p>Part III of this paper draws conclusions as to the main lines of U.S. action
                        which would seem to be called for during the period 1956–59 in the light of
                        the foregoing analysis.</p>

                    <p rend="center">III. Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Nuclear Equation.</hi> The U.S. should review its
                        present disarmament position to consider how to enhance the prospects for an
                        acceptable system which would reduce or remove the threat of unlimited
                        nuclear warfare.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of any agreed limitation of armaments, the U.S. military
                        posture should be such as to minimize the likelihood of Communist aggressive
                        action and to maximize support in the free world for U.S. policies. To this
                        end, the U.S. should maintain:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. a retaliatory and defensive capacity adequate to deter Soviet
                            nuclear attack;</item>
                        <item>b. the ability to respond forcefully to Communist aggression on a
                            scale and in a manner suited to the attainment of our political
                            objectives;</item>
                        <item>c. a position which would permit waging general war effectively in
                            defense of vital U.S. interests. The U.S. should begin to consider what
                            measures would be necessary for this purpose if the strategic use of
                            nuclear weapons should become infeasible for military or other
                            reasons.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Economic Leadership.</hi> The U.S. must be prepared
                        to assume responsibilities for economic leadership in the free world on a
                        scale commensurate with its political and military commitments.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. In order to accelerate present rates of economic development in
                            under-developed countries, the U.S. should: <list>
                                <item>(1) explore the possibilities for long-term Western European
                                    and Japanese financing of development projects that would

                                    increased trade between them and these industrialized

                                <item>(2) consider programs to help stabilize international markets
                                    for the under-developed countries’ exports;</item>
                                <item>(3) encourage U.S. private investment abroad, and maintain and
                                    seek to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. technical aid programs
                                    and existing public lending operations;</item>
                                <item>(4) insofar as the above actions do not produce accelerated
                                    rates of growth consistent with the attainment of U.S. political
                                    objectives in key under-developed countries, provide public
                                    funds on a grant or more flexible loan basis, to the extent that
                                    this is warranted by conditions in the recipient
                                    countries;</item>
                                <item>(5) seek to induce the free Asian countries to form ties of

                                    economic development programs for South and Southeast Asia, to
                                    whose fulfillment they could all contribute in varying ways, and
                                    whose execution the U.S. could assist through the policies
                                    discussed above.</item>

                            Europe’s and Japan’s long-term trade problems, the U.S. should press
                            forward vigorously with policies directed toward currency convertibility
                            and the reduction of restrictions on trade and payments in the free

                        political and economic than military integration, and, if necessary, should

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
                    <p>26. Fundamental to the attainment of an effective Free World military
                        posture, under the United States concept of collective security is the
                        development and maintenance of solidarity on the part of our Allies to the
                        point where they will not only unite in the determination of measures vital
                        to the common security, but will support those measures when the need
                        arises. Recent developments indicate that the firm foundation requisite to
                        prompt and effective action in implementation of the concept of collective
                        security has not yet been fully achieved. Failure to achieve the political
                        framework which will permit collective action against Communist aggression
                        could alter appreciably the efficacy of Free World military posture during
                        this period.</p>
                    <p>27. The deteriorating international situation, as evidenced in Indochina, and
                        the uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations now in progress will
                        probably occasion some changes in the planned U.S. military programs for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1957, as referred <pb xml:id="pg_673" n="673" facs="0703"
                        />to in paragraph 2 above, and in budget estimates for those years.</p>
                    <p>28. Events in Indochina, which have resulted in a suspension of planned
                        redeployments from the Far East, coupled with our continuing D-day <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments of forces in Europe are
                        delaying the constitution of a strategic reserve, based generally on U.S.
                        territory, with a high degree of combat readiness and a capability of being
                        moved to any threatened area. Prolonged continuance of this situation will
                        require re-examination of the personnel and major force ceilings as
                        presently planned.</p>
                    <p>29. The United States should continue to maintain its over-all superiority in
                        offensive striking power. In addition to continued emphasis on capability
                        for inflicting massive damage, this will involve carrying out programs to
                        increase the striking power, with and without atomic weapons, of all U.S.
                        forces which can be brought to bear on the enemy.</p>
                    <p>30. Although the continental defense system will be improved both
                        qualitatively and in scope, a corresponding improvement can be expected in
                        Soviet offensive capabilities, and therefore the degree of adequacy of the
                        continental defense system will be questionable. Measures should be taken to
                        provide a continental defense structure which will insure a reasonable
                        defense of our vital mobilization base. To this end:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Development of equipment and techniques necessary to increase the
                            effectiveness of the continental defense system should be
                            emphasized.</item>

                        <item>c. The adequacy of these programs should be kept under continuous
                            review to insure that the highest practicable degree of continental

                    <p>31. Free World forces will retain their ability to protect essential air
                        communications and the essential sea communications in ocean areas. In
                        peripheral seas close to the Soviet Bloc they will be unable to exercise the
                        degree of control desirable for most effective offensive action.</p>
                    <p>32. The Free World forces will be confronted with quantitative superiority in
                        ground and tactical air forces in the geographical areas contiguous to the
                        Soviet Bloc. However, the superior tactical atomic support which can be
                        provided our Allies during this period will partially offset the Allied
                        deficiencies in conventional forces.</p>
                    <p>33. Prompt action should be initiated to arrest the present trend of limiting
                        our war reserves and of narrowing our mobilization base, in order that the
                        mobilization base of the United States will <pb xml:id="pg_674" n="674"
                            facs="0704"/>be capable of the necessary rapid expansion to meet the
                        matériel requirements of a general war, including aid to our Allies.</p>
                    <p>34. The maintenance of qualitative superiority of our armed forces personnel
                        in light of quantitative requirements will become increasingly difficult
                        under existing draft policies and as the result of the serious decline in
                        the attractiveness of military service as a career. Draft policies should be
                        re-examined periodically. The recommendations contained in the Womble Board
                        Report for increasing the attractiveness of the military career should be
                        promptly and effectively implemented.</p>
                    <p>35. In order to maintain qualitative superiority in matériel, there should be
                        continuing emphasis on programs for scientific research and development and
                        for the continuous modernization and replacement of equipment for active and
                        reserve forces.</p>
                    <p>36. A satisfactory Free World military posture will be dependent in large
                        measure on the continuation of military assistance to selected countries and
                        the early establishment of German and Japanese forces.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Effective military assistance on a selective basis should be
                            continued in order to increase the ability of indigenous forces to
                            provide for the security of their national territories, to contribute to
                            the overall Free World capability to resist aggression, and to lessen
                            the reliance of the Free World upon United States military power.
                            Substantial reduction of military assistance, with its possible
                            cumulative reduction in Free World military posture, might require
                            reexamination of the planned U.S. military posture.</item>
                        <item>b. Positive measures should be taken in order to attain at an early

                            otherwise by alternative means. Similar action to insure a sizeable

                    <p>37. By virtue of the nature of the Soviet political system and the fact that
                        the deployed Soviet forces are considered capable, without further
                        mobilization, of initiating strong ground, naval, and air offensives, the
                        USSR has the capability of achieving strategic surprise. This underlines the
                        necessity of placing greatly increased emphasis on the development and
                        maintenance of the intelligence system called for in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                    <p>38. Technological advances by both the Soviet Bloc and the Free World present
                        problems of defense and opportunities for increased offensive capability.
                        These considerations require that the United States place emphasis on:</p>

                            degree of mobility.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>39. The United States is faced today with the problems associated with
                        limited military aggression. Additional instances may arise in the period
                        1956–1959. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 recognizes that such
                        aggression may compel the United States to react with military force either
                        locally at the point of attack or generally against the military power of
                        the aggressor. This requires a mobile strategic reserve. The U.S. concept of
                        collective security envisages that in countering such aggression our Allies
                        should furnish the bulk of the ground forces required, make available base
                        sites, and furnish certain facilities. The United States should continue to
                        contribute, within its capability, additional military forces and matériel
                        toward meeting requirements.</p>
                    <p>40. United States reaction to limited aggression should be attended by a
                        degree of national mobilization commensurate with the increased risk of
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>41. While both the USSR and the United States will enter the era of atomic
                        plenty during the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956–59, Allied
                        numerical and qualitative superiority in atomic weapons and means for their
                        delivery will continue to be maintained. However, increasing Soviet atomic
                        capability will tend to diminish the deterrent effect of United States
                        atomic power against peripheral aggression. With respect to general war, the
                        attainment of atomic plenty by both the United States and the USSR could
                        create a condition of mutual deterrence in which both sides would be
                        strongly inhibited from initiating general war. Under such circumstances,
                        the Soviets might well elect to pursue their ultimate objective of world
                        domination through a succession of local aggressions, either overt or
                        covert, all of which could not be successfully opposed by the Allies through
                        localized counteraction, without unacceptable commitment of resources. The
                        Free World would then be confronted with a situation in which the only
                        alternative to acquiescence in progressive accretions of territory,
                        manpower, and other resources by the Soviet Bloc would be a deliberate
                        decision to react with military force against the real source of the
                        aggression. This situation serves to emphasize the time limitation, as
                        recognized in paragraph 45 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2,
                        within which conditions must be created by the United States and the Free
                        World coalition such as to permit the Soviet-Communist threat to be met with
                        resolution, to the end that satisfactory and enduring arrangements for
                        co-existence can be established.</p></frus:attachment>

                            <hi rend="italic">In 1953</hi> it was estimated that the Soviets were
                            then capable of producing nuclear weapons with yields up to
                            “approximately one million tons of TNT” and that the Soviets might work
                            toward the “eventual modification” of their stockpile to include “very
                            high yield weapons (e.g. 500–1, 000 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>).”
                            No mention was made of production of higher yield weapons, although it
                            was estimated that the Soviets might be in an “advanced stage“ of a
                            program having the production of larger weapons as its objective.
                            (Appendices to <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>–90, Appendix B, para.
                            3.) As to the Soviet stockpile, it was estimated, with a stated margin
                            of error, that it was then 120 weapons of 30–100 <gloss target="#t_KT1"

                            “likely” by 1956. It is further estimated that in 1959 the Soviets could
                            start series production of a pilotless-aircraft-type missile capable of

                    <p>1. The mobilization base must be capable of fulfilling military requirements
                        to meet these contingencies:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>A. Involvement with forces using conventional weapons either for or

                        <item>B. The maintenance of superiority in the new weapons systems,
                            particularly nuclear weapons.</item>
                        <item>C. A balanced and protected base to make good the necessary
                            functioning of the war economy after attack and to supplement needs for
                            new production beyond the war stocks existing at the outbreak of
                            hostilities.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>2. The combinations of the amounts of reserves required at the outbreak of
                        hostilities in relation to the base, which can be counted upon to continue
                        functioning, depend upon the following assumptions:</p>
                    <p>A. That the use of nuclear weapons is either:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) decisive—finishing off the war in a few hours, days, weeks,
                            or</item>
                        <item>(2) crippling, but not decisive, so that the recuperative power of the
                            economy and tenacity of spirit will determine the outcome.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_679" n="679" facs="0709"/>
                    <p>B. Or that nuclear weapons, though perhaps decisive if used only by one side
                        and certainly basic both for attack and as a deterrent, must necessarily be
                        combined with “mixed power” of conventional weapons and forces in large
                        quantities:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) with a number of divisions in being that can deal with peripheral
                            aggression without resorting to nuclear weapons,</item>
                        <item>(2) with a number of divisions that can hold Soviet and satellite mass
                            land armies where needed until reserves and weapons strength can be
                            brought to bear to victory.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>C. Or that, despite present basic character of nuclear weapons, conventional
                        forces must be kept at a level which would permit fighting a successful
                        war:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) with only the “tactical” use of nuclear weapons,</item>
                        <item>(2) with the elimination of nuclear weapons altogether, either by
                            “outlawry” by:</item>
                        <item>(a) international action and treaties, or</item>
                        <item>(b) the fear by either side that to initiate nuclear war would invite
                            retaliation amounting to destruction.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. A further assumption is required as to the nature and extent of the damage
                        which present Soviet capabilities are capable of inflicting on the
                        mobilization base in the light of present defensive capabilities with an
                        extension throughout the period. The magnitude of the damage capable of
                        being inflicted would govern the degree to which expense and inconvenience
                        could be incurred in:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>A. Counter-measures to reduce the vulnerability of the mobilization
                            base, and</item>
                        <item>B. The degree to which stocks should be ready at the outbreak of
                            hostilities, rather than dependence upon initiating or resuming
                            production lines.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. It seems to be generally agreed that damage of more than a substantial
                        character can now be counted on throughout the entire period under
                        consideration. Present intelligence would seem to justify provisions in the
                        mobilization base against massive damage in the way of ready reserve and
                        extreme measures for adding to the protection and for reducing the
                        vulnerability and increasing the capacity of the mobilization base to
                        recuperate.</p>
                    <p>5. The mobilization planning of the Office of Defense Mobilization is based
                        upon a combination of assumptions under Section 2–B above which are thought
                        to be not inconsistent; namely, 2–A(2) and 2–B (1) and (2). Although no one
                        has officially advanced 2–C, it has formed the basis for discussions by the
                        Department of State, largely resting on 2–C(2), (with some discussions also
                        on 2–C(l).) <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, Defense, and, in general,
                        the rest of the Planning Board, appear to have eliminated 2–C. The existing
                        alignment in the Defense Department <pb xml:id="pg_680" n="680" facs="0710"
                        />can only be judged by the official comments in paper dated May 25 from the
                        Acting Secretary of Defense, transmitting <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> study on military posture for guidelines
                            consideration.<note n="12" xml:id="d117fn12">Annex 2, above.</note>
                        Assumption 2–A(2) is not emphasized by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        to the point of crippling attack and assumption 2–B(2) is heavily stressed.
                        Budget and Treasury tend to stress 2–A(2) and to feel that less reliance
                        needs to be put upon 2–B(l) and B(2) than is suggested by <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and by <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>.
                        Arguments by the State Department tend to raise attack danger to the
                        certainty of catastrophe, as a basis for discussing possible moves to take
                        nuclear disarmament more seriously or to increase conventional forces and
                        weapons so as not to put entire reliance on nuclear weapons. A balanced view
                        of total power, of deterrents, and of defense capabilities is the necessary
                        prerequisite of mobilization preparations.</p>
                    <p>6. If older weapons are stocked and production phased out, and total hard
                        goods production for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 is planned at
                        about half of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 (end) rate, are we
                        keeping a mobilization base which employs our national resources and
                        scientific capacity at a rate adequate to counter the threat from the Soviet
                        Bloc? Should we not use a stabilized figure at a high level (say $18
                        billion) to expand new weapon production to equal losses in the old weapon
                        base, transferring added new production to safe areas?</p></frus:attachment>

                    <p>1. In their memorandum to you dated 3 May 1954, subject “Methods of
                        Implementing and Enforcing the Disarmament Programme,”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d118fn2">The memorandum under reference cannot be further
                            identified.</note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that “. . . with
                        respect to the matter of disarmament the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it
                        most unrealistic, based on the entire pattern of past Soviet conduct and the
                        present international situation, to expect that any agreement which might be
                        obtained vis-à-vis the USSR would be other <pb xml:id="pg_681" n="681"
                            facs="0711"/>than to the serious disadvantage of the security interests
                        of the United States.”</p>
                    <p>2. Because of implications with respect to the vital security interests of
                        the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it appropriate that
                        they convey to you at this time their views concerning certain broader
                        aspects of the situation now confronting the United States and its Allies,
                        for consideration in connection with the future application of basic
                        national policy.</p>
                    <p>3. It is the conviction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the struggle of the
                        Free World against the spread of Soviet-Communist domination of peoples and
                        areas has now entered a precarious if not critical stage, characterized by
                        continuing Communist expansion and military growth on the one hand and the
                        emergence of divisive strains in the Free World coalition on the other. In
                        their opinion, a continuation of the present trend might well, within an
                        indeterminate but relatively short span of years, place the security of the
                        United States in such jeopardy as to render it doubtful that any military
                        establishment which our country could continue to support could be relied
                        upon to defend our territory and our institutions in the years ahead. They
                        feel that the threatening course of the cold war, recently brought into
                        clearer focus by events in the Far East and by the Berlin and Geneva
                        conferences, makes necessary a reappraisal, within the framework of current
                        basic national policy, of the tactics which have been pursued by the United
                        States in seeking to achieve its objective.</p>
                    <p>4. In the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Soviet tactics since World
                        War II reflect certain basic tenets of Soviet doctrine and strategy;
                        viz.:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. In the struggle between Communism and the Free World there can be
                            no true neutrals—the world is divided into two blocs, the Communist and
                            their “enemies”.</item>
                        <item>b. The “Iron Curtain” is an essential measure of self-preservation of
                            the Soviet regime and must be maintained as an impervious barrier to
                            “enemy” attempts to penetrate it.</item>
                        <item>c. Perversion of truth and the device of the “Big Lie” are basic
                            elements of Soviet propaganda technique.</item>
                        <item>d. There can be no harmonious existence until Communism has achieved
                            and consolidated victory on a world scale.</item>
                        <item>e. Once taken under control, territory will not be relinquished,
                            except by compulsion of force or threat of force (Greece, Iran).</item>
                        <item>f. Communist influence must be all-pervasive—to this end power vacuums
                            (e.g., Korea in 1950) are to be abhorred, “enemy” weaknesses exploited,
                            and the Soviet domain expanded by unrelenting efforts.</item>
                        <item>g. Expansion of the Soviet domain is to be accomplished by:<list>
                                <item>(1) Subversion and local seizures of power by Communist
                                    parties (Czechoslovakia).</item>
                                <item>(2) Action by armed forces other than Soviet forces (Albania,
                                    China, Korea, Indochina).</item>
                                <item>(3) Armed action by Soviet forces (Baltic States, Poland,
                                    Hungary, Bulgaria, Roumania).</item>
                                <item>(4) Negotiations—(a) as an instrument to capitalize upon
                                    situations created by overt conflict (Potsdam, Panmunjom,
                                    Geneva), (b) as a substitute for armed struggle, to probe for
                                    divisive tendencies or other enemy weaknesses and to exploit
                                    them to Soviet advantage, or (c) as a device to prevent
                                    constructive action and to gain propaganda benefits.</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>h. Until the world struggle is finally decided, a state of tension is
                            conducive to advancing Communist objectives; hence, achieving agreements
                            merely for the purpose of relieving world tension would, from the Soviet
                            standpoint, be self-defeating.</item>
                        <item>i. In negotiations, Soviet objectives are to be sought by:<list>
                                <item>(1) Inflexible adherence to demands, even fantastic ones,
                                    coupled with resistance from the outset to
                                    counter-proposals;</item>
                                <pb xml:id="pg_682" n="682" facs="0712"/>
                                <item>(2) Yielding to no substantive concessions; a concession by
                                    the “enemy” is to be treated merely as an indication that
                                    persistence in negotiation may extract further and perhaps
                                    greater advantages;</item>
                                <item>(3) Disregarding any accepted code of ethics or any conception
                                    of honor in the conduct of negotiations or in the carrying out
                                    of any agreements which might flow from them.</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>5. Weighed in the aggregate, results achieved since 1945 would tend to
                        convince the Soviet regime of the efficacy of its methods in pursuing its
                        policy of expansion. Taking advantage of every weakness and contradiction,
                        Soviet Communism during that period has amassed under its control some 800
                        millions of people, millions of square miles of territory, and vast material
                        resources. With regard to negotiations, the results would tend to confirm
                        the Soviet belief that rigid adherence to their demands will in the end
                        extract Allied concessions—the ultimate persuasive factor being the latent
                        threat of massive Soviet armed forces, which overshadows all international
                        discussions and negotiations.</p>
                    <p>6. With specific regard to negotiations in the field of disarmament, the
                        record of the United States since 1946 is one of persistent effort to find
                        ways of easing the burden of armaments under appropriate safeguards and of
                        lessening the threat of war. The USSR, on the other hand, while engaging in
                        propaganda for the elimination of atomic weapons, has made only specious
                        proposals regarding limitation of conventional armaments, although it
                        maintains the largest conventional military establishment in the world. In
                        the UN Disarmament Commission, the USSR has consistently refused to clarify
                        its vague and ambiguous proposals or to discuss any plan other than its
                        own.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_683" n="683" facs="0713"/>
                    <p>7. Moral prerequisites recognized as fundamental to any effective and
                        comprehensive system for the balanced reduction of all armaments and the
                        international control of atomic energy are (a) an open world, and (b) good
                        faith on the part of the participating powers. The continued existence of
                        the Iron Curtain would make a mockery of any inspection system which might
                        be devised and, if the record of past Soviet conduct with respect to solemn
                        international agreements is a true index, Soviet bad faith, evasion, and
                        outright violation would render any disarmament agreement sterile, except as
                        a means to advance Soviet objectives.</p>
                    <p>8. Soviet and Soviet-Satellite violations of international treaties and
                        agreements are too numerous to recite here and too well known to require
                        documentation. In unbroken sequence from Yalta to Korea such treaties and
                        agreements, even though achieved originally at a cost of major concessions
                        by the Western Powers, have been evaded and perverted by the Communists to
                        suit their own designs. In the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the
                        instability of peace throughout the world is due, in large measure, to
                        deliberate Soviet violations of its international pledges and treaty
                        commitments. The Joint Chiefs of Staff find no cause for hope that, barring
                        a basic change in the attitude of the Soviet regime, any future
                        international agreement would be faithfully observed by the USSR or its
                        Satellites.</p>
                    <p>9. A number of measures by which the Soviets could offer evidence of their
                        good faith have been suggested by the President and other allied statesmen,
                        notably Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CHURCHILLWS1">Churchill</persName>. These
                        measures need not be restated in detail here, but if the Soviets were to
                        take the following actions, or even some of them, such could be accepted as
                        a demonstration of a basic change of attitude on the part of the regime,
                        offering hope of a peaceful settlement of world issues:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Free the million or more German and Japanese prisoners they now
                            hold;</item>
                        <item>b. Release the Satellite nations and allow them the free choice of
                            their own form of government;</item>
                        <item>c. Show a willingness to conclude just peace treaties with Germany and
                            Austria;</item>
                        <item>d. Cease fomenting and supporting civil war and armed aggression, as
                            in Indochina, Malaya, and Korea;</item>
                        <item>e. Discontinue the campaign of subversion and hate against the
                            non-Cominform world;</item>
                        <item>f. Withdraw their military forces to the borders of the USSR;</item>
                        <item>g. Remove the Iron Curtain and permit ordinary entry and travel on
                            equal terms with other nations;</item>
                        <item>h. Faithfully observe and support the provisions of the United Nations
                            Charter.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_684" n="684" facs="0714"/>
                    <p>10. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the Soviets will hold steadfastly
                        to their objective of world domination and will not be disposed to make
                        substantive concessions in the course of international negotiations, even on
                        a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> basis, unless and until they have been
                        convinced that failure to achieve lasting solutions of major issues will
                        involve grave risks to the maintenance of their regime. The Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff consider further that until the United States and its Allies, by means
                        of positive actions, confront the USSR with the risks which might attend
                        such a failure, the Soviet regime will remain unconvinced of the possible
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>11. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are strongly of the opinion that until a
                        suitable climate for negotiations has been brought about, it will be not
                        only fruitless but hazardous for the United States to continue its efforts
                        to arrive at solutions to world problems through the normal processes of
                        negotiation with the USSR. In the face of extravagant and persistent Soviet
                        demands, our principal Allies, possibly impelled by a mounting fear of
                        Soviet atomic capability, have shown an increasing disposition to seek
                        agreements at whatever cost, apparently without adequate realization of the
                        vital Western security interests at stake, or in disregard of those
                        interests. Further, once joint negotiations have been undertaken, the United
                        States is placed under strong compulsion to join in making substantive and
                        unwarranted concessions to the Soviets in the interest of showing some
                        degree of progress toward reaching agreement and of preserving a facade of
                        Allied solidarity. Negotiation under such conditions—irresolution on the
                        part of our Allies coupled with Soviet inflexibility—holds no promise of an
                        outcome favorable to United States or over-all Allied security interests. It
                        should not be concluded that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would advocate that
                        the United States undertake to attain its objectives without benefit of
                        allies. Rather, they feel that there is a pressing necessity that our Allies
                        be brought to view the world situation in the same light and with the same
                        urgency as does the United States.</p>
                    <p>12. Basic United States policy, as set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/2, recognizes the time limitation within which
                        conditions must be created by the United States and the Free World coalition
                        such as to permit the Soviet-Communist threat to be met with resolution, to
                        the end that satisfactory and enduring arrangements for co-existence can be
                        negotiated. The engulfment of a large segment of the world and its people by
                        the Soviets has been accomplished during the period in which the United
                        States first held a monopoly and then a significant superiority in atomic
                        weapons and in the means for their delivery. It may properly be assumed
                        that, unless the Soviet attitude is altered by outside influences, the
                        aggressive and <pb xml:id="pg_685" n="685" facs="0715"/>irresponsible
                        tactics pursued with success by the Soviets thus far will be only a prelude
                        to the proportions which such tactics will attain once the present atomic
                        superiority of the United States has been neutralized—a condition which is
                        expected to be reached within the latter part of the period <gloss

                        therefore, is that if the Western nations hope to reach timely and lasting
                        settlements vis-à-vis the USSR, they must proceed now to formulate their
                        just demands and then steadfastly to press for their consummation while the
                        United States still holds atomic superiority. Basic for that purpose is the
                        development of political solidarity and staunch unity of purpose among our
                        Allies to the point where they will not only join in the determination of
                        measures vital to the common security but will resolutely support those
                        measures when the need arises. The alternative is to compromise United
                        States and Western security interests by permitting the lowest common
                        denominator of the coalition to determine the level and scope of our actions
                        in pursuit of our objectives.</p>
                    <p>13. Based on their analysis, from the military point of view, of the
                        situation now confronting the United States and its Allies, the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff have arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Until the USSR, by positive action, demonstrates a basic change of
                            attitude by some such actions as those listed in paragraph 9 above, the
                            United States should refrain from further attempts through negotiations
                            to arrive at agreements with the USSR on the subjects of disarmament,
                            atomic energy or any other of the world issues, and should so inform the
                            USSR officially and repeatedly, publicly releasing each such
                            announcement.</item>
                        <item>b. The United States should recognize now, and should seek to persuade
                            its Allies, that time limitations dictate the necessity of confronting
                            the Soviets with unmistakable evidence of an unyielding determination to
                            halt further Communist expansion, and of convincing them that aggression
                            will be met with counteraction which, inherently, will hold grave risks
                            to the maintenance of their regime;</item>
                        <item>c. The United States should take all reasonable measures to increase
                            political solidarity and staunch determination among its Allies
                            recognizing, however, that U.S. security interests may require, on
                            occasion, United States action which not all of our Allies would endorse
                            or be willing to join.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>14. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_686" n="686" facs="0716"/>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The foregoing views be made available to the National Security
                            Council for consideration in the application of basic national
                            policy;</item>
                        <item>b. These views be given consideration in the formulation of the
                            Department of Defense position with respect to the interdepartmental
                            review of United States disarmament policy now in progress.</item>

                    <p>At the outset of his briefing of the Council on the reference report (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> stressed the tentative character of <pb
                            xml:id="pg_687" n="687" facs="0717"/>the guidelines submitted by the
                        Planning Board, and noted that there were many disagreements. He also
                        expressed the hope that the Council would direct the Planning Board to
                        revise the guidelines report in the light of discussion at this Council
                        meeting and of next week’s meeting on continental defense. He then read the
                        first seven pages of the report, which consisted of the intelligence
                        estimate. He explained that the rest of the paper was concerned with
                        suggested guidance on how to deal with the situation outlined in the
                        intelligence estimate. The first major issue arose in paragraph 11 and
                        involved the question of what measures the United States should take to
                        protect its retaliatory capacity against foreseeable Soviet attack. The
                        left-hand column of the split paragraph called on the United States to take
                        “whatever measures were necessary to protect this capacity”, and stated that
                        the expenditures necessary for this purpose were a requisite to U.S.
                        survival. The right-hand column called upon the United States “to take all
                        practicable measures to protect this capacity.”</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> had explained the
                        split views in paragraph 11, the President said that the point of view
                        expressed in the left-hand column was based on the erroneous premise that
                        you could have an absolute defense of our retaliatory capability, and
                        completely overlooked the fact that modern warfare is a relative matter. He
                        believed that the right-hand column, calling simply for all practicable
                        measures, was the better and more accurate statement. For the moment, at
                        least, it could be checked as the President’s choice.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> inquired
                        whether the left-hand column meant to indicate that other defense measures
                        were to take a lower priority than measures designed to protect this
                        retaliatory capacity. The President said that of course this was the intent
                        of the language, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        pointed out that as an alternative to assigning lower priority to the other
                        elements in our military program, you could, of course, agree to larger
                        expenditures on measures to protect the U.S. retaliatory capability.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then explained the
                        difference in view with respect to disarmament which was indicated by the
                        split in paragraph 13. The President said that this was one place in the
                        paper where he could see no antithesis between the positions set forth in
                        the parallel columns. He thought that paragraph 13–b (right-hand side of the
                        page), which emphasized doubts as to whether any safe and enforceable system
                        for limiting armaments could be achieved as long as the Soviet objectives
                        and regime remained substantially as they are today, was not incompatible
                        with the position in the left-hand column, which advocated that the United
                        States continue to reexamine its position on disarmament and especially to
                        determine whether safeguards could be devised entailing less risk for U.S.
                        security <pb xml:id="pg_688" n="688" facs="0718"/>than no limitation of
                        armaments. No one who was in hit right mind, said the President, would
                        disagree that we should continue to examine this question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that
                        perhaps the real issue in paragraph 13 was to be found in the last four
                        lines of the left-hand column, which raised the question “whether the U.S.
                        should be willing to agree to effective nuclear disarmament in the absence
                        of conventional disarmament.”. The President agreed that this put up a
                        different question, but said that nuclear disarmament, as opposed to general
                        disarmament, was open to the even greater question of enforceability. He
                        repeated the statements he had made at the Council meeting the day before,
                        to the effect that he would gladly accept nuclear disarmament alone if he
                        was sure that he could get the genuine article.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that the real
                        question that had bothered the Planning Board was our willingness to relax
                        on the safeguards to disarmament in the hopes of obtaining Soviet agreement.
                        The President repeated his view that it would certainly be to the net
                        advantage of the United States to agree to nuclear disarmament alone if such
                        nuclear disarmament were sure and enforceable. It was nevertheless
                        impossible to see how it could be secured in the foreseeable future. The
                        President added that he would gladly go back to the kind of warfare which
                        was waged in 1941 if in 1945 the <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>-bomb had
                        proved impossible to make. The net of it all was that until you could be
                        sure of achieving enforceability, the United States would have to maintain
                        its present position of refusing to agree to atomic disarmament except as
                        part of a general disarmament.</p>
                    <p>Going on, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out
                        that one of the major issues on which the Planning Board sought light from
                        the Council occurred in paragraph 14, which raised the question whether, in
                        view of the possible nuclear balance in 1956–59, the United States could
                        continue to place major reliance on its nuclear capabilities as a means of
                        waging general war. The left-hand text advocated an increase in the forces
                        and mobilization potential which the U.S. and its allies would need to wage
                        war effectively without strategic use of nuclear weapons. The right-hand
                        text insisted that the United States must accept the risks involved in
                        relying on strategic nuclear capabilities as a means of waging general war,
                        and must continue to make clear its determination to meet Soviet attack with
                        all available weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President thought that the National Security Council had decided this
                        question quite a long time ago—namely, in February 1953. Were we able to
                        pick out a priority in the types of war we will wage and a priority as to
                        the means and measures of waging <pb xml:id="pg_689" n="689" facs="0719"
                        />this war? It was simply impossible to try to play safe in all the possible
                        kinds of warfare. What we required was an intelligent estimate of where to
                        allocate this priority.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out
                        that if the Council chose the left-hand column, which called for a great
                        increase in conventional forces, it would have completely changed the basis
                        of all our current strategic planning for war. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed wholeheartedly with
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, but said that
                        perhaps it was wholesome to have this issue raised once again so that it
                        could be resettled thoroughly in favor of the right-hand column, which
                        advocated continuation of our current military posture and strategy. The
                        President expressed agreement with these views, and said that if the Council
                        came to believe what was set forth in the left-hand column we might just as
                        well stop any further talk about preserving a sound U.S. economy and proceed
                        to transform ourselves forthwith into a garrison state. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> added the warning that these
                        constant references to possible changes in our agreed military strategy
                        caused serious dissension in the Department of Defense. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that while the
                        National Security Council had long since decided this question, the decision
                        had not been universally accepted in the responsible departments and
                        agencies. It was high time that this decision was enforced.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said he was
                        concerned with this paragraph as it related to mobilization requirements. If
                        the question of our military strategy wasn’t settled, at least for a
                        considerable period, the Defense Department would be unable to provide
                            <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> with a solid set of requirements
                        called for by the agreed strategic plans. We must at least freeze our
                        thinking long enough to make possible a realistic estimate of our
                        mobilization requirements for war.</p>
                    <p>The President, pointing out that in destruction alone there was no victory,
                        said that according to his idea of what we face, we should have the
                        capability so far as possible of warding off destructive enemy attack and as
                        quickly as possible ourselves to be able to destroy the war potential of the
                        enemy. After these initial moves in a future war, the United States might
                        have to contemplate a 12-year mobilization program to achieve final victory
                        in the war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> explained that the
                        reason why the Planning Board had raised this “hoary issue” was the view of
                        some of its members that a state of mutual deterrence, resulting from atomic
                        plenty on both sides, might enable the Soviet Union to avoid atomic war and
                        nibble the free world to death piece by piece. The President replied that he
                        disagreed wholly with this point of view, which he regarded as completely
                        erroneous. The more atomic weapons each side obtains, the more anxious it
                        will be to use these weapons. The President noted the analogous German
                        problem with respect to the use <pb xml:id="pg_690" n="690" facs="0720"/>of
                        poison gases in the later stages of World War II. In view of the fact that
                        the attacking allied forces had the Germans encircled, it was much easier
                        for the allies to make effective use of such gases than for the Germans to
                        do so. The Germans realized that the use of poison gas would therefore be a
                        strategic error. From this fact some people would deduce that the Russians
                        will not make use of nuclear weapons in a future war; but there was no true
                        analogy here.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that in his
                        own study of the problems facing the United States he had lately come to
                        some very serious conclusions. The first of these was that the time for the
                        “agonizing reappraisal”<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Reference is to a remark
                            made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> in
                            a formal statement before the North Atlantic Council meeting at its
                            Twelfth Session at Paris, Dec. 14, 1953; for text, see <ref
                                target="frus1952-54v05p1">vol. V, Part 1</ref>, p. 461.</note> of
                        U.S. basic security policy was at hand. With regard to our force levels,
                        even if our Army had been twice as large as it was and our Navy and Air
                        Force likewise much stronger, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> said we probably wouldn’t have done a darn thing
                        different than we had done in the last year and a half. We ought to
                        investigate why this was so and if our policies had been wrong.</p>
                    <p>Another reason for this reappraisal, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, was the fact that the things
                        that the United States had hoped for had not happened and, if he could
                        safely say it in the confines of this room, our policies have not been
                        successful, as witness <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, Indochina,
                        Trieste, etc., etc. We ought, therefore, to take a whole new look at our
                        problems. We were certainly not going to solve these problems by simply
                        making our military forces twice as big as at present. Our military posture
                        at present was good. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> also expressed himself as convinced that if World War
                        III actually occurred, the results would be to push the world deeper into
                        Communism and to transform the United States into a dictatorship.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                        Council should now get back to the specific issue involved in paragraph 14,
                        and said that he judged there was a preference for the exposition set forth
                        in the righthand column.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that if
                        the Council were to choose this view, the text should be revised to indicate
                        that primary reliance upon our strategic nuclear capabilities should be
                        qualified by a statement that our conventional forces should simultaneously
                        be maintained in an appropriate form. With some heat, the President said
                        that this whole issue had been greatly misunderstood. We had never proposed
                        to strip ourselves naked of all military capabilities except the nuclear. It
                        was ridiculous to imagine anything of this <pb xml:id="pg_691" n="691"
                            facs="0721"/>sort, and he saw no need for any qualifications such as
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> had suggested.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> replied that
                        of course he understood the relationship between nuclear and conventional
                        forces, but still thought it best that the report say something explicit on
                        maintenance of conventional forces so that the matter would be thoroughly
                        understood throughout the Government agencies concerned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                        issues raised by paragraph 17 were very relevant to the maintenance of
                        conventional forces and should be examined before a response was made to
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s point. He
                        then read the right-hand version of paragraph 17, which stated that “present
                        and planned implementation of programs under paragraphs 9, 10 and 34 of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 are considered fully adequate
                        to meet the risks of increasing Soviet nuclear capabilities, etc.” The
                        left-hand column, on the contrary, indicated that the increasing Soviet
                        nuclear capabilities made it necessary for the United States to make greater
                        efforts than were contemplated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2,
                        and specified in subparagraphs a, b and c the specific areas of greater
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was inclined to have a little of the content of both
                        these columns. For example, he agreed with the need to develop more rapidly
                        U.S. reserve forces, though he assumed that this was provided for in
                        paragraphs 9, 10 and 34 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that while this
                        might be the case for reserve forces, subparagraph c called for creation of
                        a strategic reserve which does not now exist. The President said that in
                        fact he was not much moved by subparagraph c, but that he was interested in
                        measures to develop reserve forces in the United States capable of bridging
                        the gap between M–Day and the creation of new units from the raw manpower
                        pool. He still believed that the differences between the points of view on
                        paragraph 17 were not as great as might appear.</p>
                    <p>With respect to paragraph 17–a, which called for the development of war
                        reserves of matériel and the development and maintenance of a broader
                        mobilization base, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> said he doubted if we were now in a position to
                        make a decision, since we have not drawn up a mobilization requirements
                        statement in terms of our current military strategy. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> warned, however, that if we
                        proposed a mobilization base adequate to support our allies who do not have
                        an adequate mobilization base, we would be adding a commitment not in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 and one which involved a very
                        considerable increase in costs.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the differences in the two versions of paragraph 17, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                        left-hand column in general called for greater U.S. efforts, larger U.S.
                        forces, and keener U.S. alertness. It represented the views of individuals
                        who were very <pb xml:id="pg_692" n="692" facs="0722"/>greatly worried by
                        the increasing Russian military capabilities. The views in the right-hand
                        column were those of the individuals who believed that however serious the
                        situation we could not do everything and must be content with making wise
                        allocation of available resources.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that as
                        it seemed to him, unless and until the agonizing reappraisal had been
                        completed, and as long as the present basic security policy continues to be
                        valid, the original <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> strategy to carry
                        out this policy should be accepted and maintained.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed some impatience with the phrase “agonizing
                        reappraisal”, and said he thought that the Secretary of State shared his
                        impatience with the phrase. In any event, as originally used this applied to
                        U.S. policies with respect to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that this
                        was no longer enough, and he wanted the scope of the agonizing reappraisal
                        expanded. He repeated his conviction that no solution could be obtained by
                        simply going in for a larger military program. The President said that he
                        agreed to this view, but only “within reason”. He said, for example, that he
                        was convinced that we need a more adequate reserve program in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that as he
                        saw it, our estimate of Soviet capabilities had greatly increased. We ought,
                        therefore, to increase our own military capabilities if this could be done
                        in accordance with the economic principles of the Administration. Certainly
                        the new Soviet capabilities called for some step-up of our own. Secretaries
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> and
                            <persName>Wilson</persName> expressed emphatic disagreement with
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>’s position.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> reminded
                        the Council that it had earlier decided on an adequate military program, and
                        that what we must do now was to get down and implement this program rather
                        than discard it and adopt some new one. The President, addressing Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, insisted that
                        there was nevertheless much in Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>’s argument. Obviously our earlier estimates of
                        Soviet capabilities were faulty. Accordingly, we will need to step up our
                        own military capabilities in certain specific areas, though of course not
                        all across the board. But you certainly could not ignore the new estimate of
                        Soviet capabilities at the beginning of the paper.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> reiterated his
                        conviction that arms and arms alone would not solve the problem posed by the
                        Soviet threat. We must show accomplishment in other than the military areas,
                        or else we shall lose all our allies. As it was, our prestige was declining
                        everywhere. Many things that we had hoped to accomplish had not been
                        accomplished. We should try to figure out why this was so. He was making a
                        plea, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>,
                        that whatever <pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0723"/>measures we decide to
                        take about our military program, let’s also try to see that we do better in
                        the other areas of endeavor.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                        had a point to make with respect to paragraph 17–a. Under present military
                        programs, and also contemplating the use of atomic weapons, there inevitably
                        arose understandable differences of opinion as to war reserves and the
                        mobilization base. Some people believe we need to maintain our existing
                        conventional forces in Europe. Others insist that we can afford to place
                        greater reliance there on nuclear power. It was hard to resolve these
                        conflicting views when the question of stockpiling arose, but he did wish to
                        point out, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, that this is not all “black and white”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he
                        believed that the statement in the righthand column of paragraph 17 was a
                        dangerous statement from an intelligence point of view. We were really not
                        in a position to make a statement that our present programs were fully
                        adequate to meet the risks of increasing Soviet nuclear capabilities, over a
                        period extending through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. The
                        President expressed agreement with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                        view.</p>
                    <p>After a brief exposition of paragraphs 19 and 20, where he explained the
                        differences in view were largely a matter of degree of emphasis and
                        approach, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> went on to
                        paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 which, he pointed out, embraced the wide area of
                        problems raised for the United States by its allies and on which the Council
                        would be particularly anxious to have the views of the Secretary of State.
                        The significant split in the views of the Planning Board was set forth in
                        the double columns on page 19. The column on the left emphasized the
                        importance of preserving our alliances. The column on the right emphasized
                        the importance of preserving U.S. freedom of action.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he could not understand of what possible value to the
                        Planning Board would be any decision by the Council between these views made
                        in the abstract. When a specific case came up the Council would meet and
                        decide it on its merits, but the question of which emphasis to take would
                        have to be decided with respect to concrete cases at the time. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> attempted to explain the value
                        of Council guidance on this point, but did not succeed in convincing the
                        President that such guidance on this issue would be useful. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the Secretary of
                        State for his comments, noting that he had been silent throughout most of
                        the discussion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that before
                        addressing himself to the paragraphs in question, he had a few remarks to
                        make on the guidelines report as a whole. He believed it to be a valuable
                        and important paper which had forced the issues up for the Council’s
                        attention, <pb xml:id="pg_694" n="694" facs="0724"/>although, of course,
                        none of them could be settled in an hour’s time. He hoped, continued
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, to take a week
                        off later on in the summer, after Congress had adjourned, and devote it
                        entirely to these problems. Meanwhile, he expressed agreement with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s position on a
                        reappraisal of U.S. foreign policy. This, of course, ought to be
                        continuously reappraised, but it was particularly important to do so at the
                        present time. Certain of the pre-suppositions which the Administration had
                        inherited seemed not to have been valid. This was particularly true of the
                        pre-supposition of dependence of our allies on the United States. This had
                        turned out to be not as great as had been thought at the end of the war. In
                        some respects this greater independence was a good thing since, after all,
                        one of our objectives had been to assist our allies to stand on their own
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>Over and above these matters, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said, we were confronting two basic problems. The
                        first of these arose from the fact that the United States does not have an
                        adequate defense against Communist expansion by means other than war. The
                        Council should bear in mind that in almost every instance the Soviets have
                        historically avoided open war in seeking to obtain their objectives. The
                        exceptions were the winter war against Finland and the assault on Poland in
                        1939. In general, the Soviets prefer to use the methods of civil war and
                        subversion, and it was through these that they had extended their domination
                        over six hundred million people. They were engaged in this very process in
                        Guatemala, France, and elsewhere. While we have no adequate answer as yet to
                        these methods, we can at least be sure that we will never get an adequate
                        answer in purely military terms.</p>
                    <p>The second major problem derived from the growing danger of atomic war. In
                        light of this, our “tough policy” was becoming increasingly unpopular
                        throughout the free world; whereas the British “soft policy” was gaining
                        prestige and acceptance both in Europe and Asia. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        contribution to the guidelines study expressed their belief that the United
                        States should take full advantage of its present atomic superiority to exert
                        pressure on the Soviet Union. If we do so, however, very few of our allies
                        will follow us. They will follow those who say “let’s not be tough and let’s
                        not press our issues with Russia.” The Geneva Conference, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, provided sufficient
                        evidence of this point. The tide is clearly running against us in the
                        channel of this tough policy. If we are to continue to pursue it we shall
                        lose many of our allies, and this in itself compels a reappraisal of our
                        basic policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        added that of course he did not mind standing alone if this were the right
                        thing to do, but let us at least <pb xml:id="pg_695" n="695" facs="0725"
                        />understand what is at stake. In brief, we can’t have our cake and eat it
                        too.</p>
                    <p>These two factors—creeping Communist penetration and wide distrust of U.S.
                        strategy among our allies—are whittling down the influence of the United
                        States. We must recognize the fact that we can no longer run the free world,
                        and accordingly review our existing basic security policy. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> again stated his
                        agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>,
                        and stated that he was not at all happy about the way things had gone for
                        us, but said that the reasons for this were those he had just explained.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> denied that he
                        was advocating a “tough policy”, and said that he believed that the
                        statement of military policy contributed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the
                        guidelines project<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">Reference is presumably to
                            Annex 2 to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422, <ref
                                target="#pg_672">p. 672</ref>.</note> was a sound and valid
                        statement. He reiterated his position by stating that he was completely
                        satisfied, one, that an increase of ten or twenty percent in our military
                        programs offered no solution to our problems; second, that in point of fact
                        we were not getting along very well, and third, that the time had come for a
                        complete new look at our basic policy.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed some bewilderment over the term “tough policy”. What
                        does this label mean? For example, the United States had believed in taking
                        more positive action in Indochina than our allies believed desirable. We had
                        lost the argument. Was this a tough policy? At any rate, Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHURCHILLWS1">Winston Churchill</persName> seems to have
                        come around to the realization that it was a sounder policy than the
                        British.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> smilingly
                        pointed out that this might be so, but it didn’t sound likely from the tone
                        of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDENSA1">Eden</persName>’s speech in the House
                        of Commons just before leaving for the United States. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> explained briefly the content
                        of the Foreign Secretary’s address, and said that he was not at all
                        impressed with the idea of an Asian Locarno. Among other disadvantages, such
                        an Asian Locarno would involve United States recognition of Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he was still not convinced that our policy should
                        be described as a tough policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> pointed out, to illustrate this phrase, that a Joint
                        Chiefs paper, dated June 23, 1954,<note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5">
                            <ref target="#d118">

                            </ref>.</note> concluded that the United States should press the
                        Russians hard during the few years in which it would retain atomic
                        superiority. Another illustration was the views of the Joint Chiefs, set
                        forth in our recent policy paper on Italy,<note n="6" xml:id="d119fn6">For
                            documentation on Italy, see <ref target="frus1952-54v06p1">volume

                        to Communism and should do whatever was necessary to prevent such further
                        losses. There was much to be said for both these <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> views, but nevertheless, none of our allies would go along
                        with these views except Rhee, Chiang, and possibly the Greeks and the Turks.
                        The President added that perhaps Franco would join us.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to state that if this were indeed the situation, we
                        should perhaps come back to the very grave question: Should the United
                        States now get ready to fight the Soviet Union? The President pointed out
                        that he had brought up this question more than once at prior Council
                        meetings, and that he had never done so facetiously.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that perhaps the reason why the situation we face is so serious is
                        that the United States had failed to carry through on its policies. The
                        President asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> to name an instance, and Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> replied, “In Indochina, for
                        example.” The President argued that our policy in Indochina was to attempt
                        to induce the interested nations to join with us in order to prevent the
                        loss of Indochina. That had been our policy, but the other nations had been
                        unwilling to join us. Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> agreed that such had been our policy in Indochina,
                        but it was also our policy to save Indochina from Communism. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDENSA1">Eden</persName> had believed that this objective
                        could be secured by a softer course of action, and he had failed at Geneva.
                        Our own more forceful policy had been frustrated. Thus neither policy had
                        worked, and the results were to the general disadvantage of the whole free
                        world. All may not be lost, however, if the British finally come to realize
                        the failure of their own policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that far
                        from thinking their policy a failure, the British believed it a glowing
                        success. Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said
                        that it was by no means certain that we might not yet have to face up to the
                        issue in Indochina, particularly if Mendes-France failed to get the results
                        he had promised by July 20.<note n="7" xml:id="d119fn7">For documentation on
                            Indochina, see <ref target="frus1952-54v08">volume XIII</ref>.</note>
                        Certainly this was not the time for mutual recriminations, and Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said he did not
                        believe that we should soften our policy toward the Soviets. It was better
                        to let our allies put their methods to the test. If these methods fail, our
                        allies may yet be won over to our point of view.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that as it seemed to him, the United States watched,
                        hesitated, and didn’t know what policy to choose; whereas our enemy knew his
                        policy and proceeded to carry it out.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> interposed to
                        call once again for a reappraisal of our basic national security policy and
                        position. He said he was as <pb xml:id="pg_697" n="697" facs="0727"
                        />confused as the President as to whether our policies were tough or soft.
                        In any case, we ought to have a firm policy which clearly recognized the
                        realities in the world situation. We must find out why Communism was being
                        so widely accepted. What was the real motivation of the nations which
                        accepted Communism? Moreover, was it not possible, if we were given time and
                        if we stopped calling the Russians “dirty bastards”, to get through this
                        difficult stage in our history?</p>
                    <p>The President said it didn’t seem to him that you had to look very hard to
                        find the motivation which led many areas of the world to accept Communism.
                        In many underdeveloped areas the motivation was all too plain.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> suggested
                        that over the next few weeks the members of the National Security Council
                        should devote a great deal of their time to this basic reappraisal. We
                        should take out the word “agonizing” and substitute for it the word
                        “realistic”. This reappraisal should examine what the United States would
                        like to be able to maintain as a world position and what it can afford to
                        maintain. Take Japan, for instance. What is it going to cost the United
                        States to see that Japan remains aligned with the free world? There were
                        going to be many costs beyond the military costs. Germany is another
                        example. We have found that we can’t afford to support those idealistic
                        objectives and positions which we had set when the Administration had first
                        come into power. Accordingly, over the next sixty days let us think about
                        what positions we could support. In the meantime, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/2 is it. Our basic policy stands and everybody must be
                        made to hew to the line unless and until this basic policy were subsequently
                        changed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> expressed the hope

                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 rather than two documents purporting
                        to state our basic security policy—namely, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/2 and guidelines. Two documents would engender
                        confusion.</p>
                    <p>The President, reverting again to the problem of tough policies and soft
                        policies, said that he was a pragmatic sort of guy and these labels had
                        meaning to him only when applied to concrete cases. On East-West trade, for
                        example, the President said he subscribed wholly to the British point of
                        view. The trouble in this field resulted chiefly from domestic political
                        pressures.</p>

                    <p>At its 205th meeting on July 1 the National Security Council considered six
                        progress reports on continental defense, none printed, presented by
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Robert C. Sprague</persName> who had
                        been appointed by President <persName corresp="#p_EISENHOWERGADD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> on June 18 as Consultant to the Council on the
                        progress reports. In introducing <persName corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1"
                            >Sprague</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        noted that on May 13, “the Council agreed that Progress Reports on
                        Continental Defense should be rendered semi-annually with the first as of
                        June 15, 1954.” <persName corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Sprague</persName> then
                        introduced the six reports based upon the basic continental defense report,
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408 of February 11 (page 609).
                        Following lengthy and detailed discussion of these reports, and of other
                        matters, the Council turned briefly to a discussion of “Tentative Guidelines
                        Under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 for Fiscal Year 1956”, and
                        after further inconclusive discussion directed the Planning Board “to
                        prepare, for early Council consideration, a statement of policy on the
                        subject in the light of: (1) Council discussion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5422 and further review thereof by the respective

                    </p>
                    <p>The primary purpose of the paper is to set forth budgetary guidance. For this
                        purpose, it seems to me to place proper emphasis upon:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(a) the maintenance and protection of our retaliatory striking force
                            (see paragraphs 6 and 7);</item>
                        <item>(b) appropriate strength (U.S. and indigenous) to defeat local
                            aggression (see paragraph 12);</item>
                        <item>(c) greater efforts in the Far East and underdeveloped countries
                            (paragraphs 18 and 21); and</item>
                        <item>(d) a more coherent economic approach to world problems (paragraphs
                            22–25).</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I have some doubts about certain premises stated in the paper. As Soviet
                        nuclear power grows, they may not necessarily feel free to take increasingly
                        positive action (see paragraph 4). Also, while the U.S. should certainly
                        seek to convince the Soviets that we are prepared to counter aggression by
                        strategic atomic attack, I am not sure that when nuclear balance is reached,
                        the U.S. will indefinitely be able to base its strategy for fighting a
                        general war on initiating the strategic use of nuclear weapons (see
                        paragraphs 3 and 9).</p>
                    <p>Although this paper seems to cover a number of subjects not related directly
                        to budget guidance, it does not purport to set the <pb xml:id="pg_700"
                            n="700" facs="0730"/>over-all political framework of our national
                        strategy. With this understanding, it seems to me that the parts directed
                        primarily to the subject of relations with our allies (see paragraphs 15,
                        16, and 20) contain acceptable general principles.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> presented <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 to the Council. He recalled that on
                        June 24 and July 1 the Council had considered “Tentative Guidelines” (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422) and had directed the Planning Board
                        to prepare a revised statement of guidelines on the basis of the Council’s
                        discussions, further reviews by the departments and agencies concerned, and
                        the progress reports on continental defense which were taken up at the
                        Council meeting on July 1. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 is the
                        Planning Board’s compliance with the Council’s directive. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> noted that although the number
                        of differing views has been greatly reduced in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5422/1, there still persist a number of splits. When the
                        Council has resolved these splits, and if it adopts the statement of policy,
                        the Planning Board recommends that the paper be submitted to the President
                        with the recommendation that he approve it as “Guidelines under <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2” for the development of national
                        security programs by the appropriate departments and agencies for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, including the preparation of budget
                        requests therefor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called the
                        attention of the Council to the Appendices A and B of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1. He summarized the high points of
                        Appendix A, “Estimate of the World Situation and Outlook Through Mid-1959”,
                        as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. Soviet nuclear capability, both in weapons and delivery systems,
                            has substantially increased.</item>
                        <item>2. Conflicts of interests and divisive forces have threatened unity of
                            action by free world allies.</item>
                        <item>3. There is greater likelihood that Communist powers will seek to
                            expand control by “creeping expansion” and subversion, rather than by
                            overt attack.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>With respect to Appendix B, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> noted that the budget receipts in the table on page
                        26 would be somewhat higher under certain assumptions made by the Council of
                        Economic Advisers. Under these assumptions the figure of $58.5 billion for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 would become $60.8 billion, and
                        the $60 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 would become
                        $62.2 billion. On a cash budget basis, which would include Social Security
                        receipts of $3 billion annually, the indicated gap in the table, of $2.2
                        billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, would become $ + .8
                        billion and the indicated balance for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                        of $ + .7 billion would become $ + 3.7 billion. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> noted also that the tabulation
                        on <pb xml:id="pg_702" n="702" facs="0732"/>page 26 was prepared on the
                        basis of the President’s program submitted to Congress rather than on the
                        tax bill as enacted.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the guidelines statement of policy, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> read the following as the six
                        most basic guidelines in the paper:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. We should maintain and protect our massive nuclear retaliatory
                            capacity as a deterrent to, and for use in general war.</item>
                        <item>2. We should accelerate “continental defense” programs (including
                            air-to-air rockets) to offset increased Soviet nuclear
                            capabilities.</item>
                        <item>3. We should expect to cope with local aggressions (“brush fires”)
                            with indigenous forces, provided with U.S. military assistance, economic
                            defense support, and logistic support, and aided by mobile U.S.
                            forces.</item>
                        <item>4. Communist “creeping expansion” and subversion is more likely than
                            Communist armed attack. We should counter it with cooperative programs
                            for economic growth, especially in Asia and parts of Latin America. We
                            should also counter it by providing political support, covert
                            operations, and military assistance for internal stability. We should be
                            prepared, with maximum support of other nations, to give military
                            support to friendly governments and forces against local
                            Communists.</item>
                        <item>5. We should seek to strengthen the cohesion and determination of the
                            free world to oppose Communist expansion by any means; but we should be
                            ready to act unilaterally, if it is to our net advantage. We should
                            continue to help build the strength and cohesion of Western Europe as
                            the major power source. But we should also increase efforts in Asia to
                            block Communist “creeping expansion”, being less influenced in the
                            Pacific area by our European allies.</item>
                        <item>6. We should continue to operate under the basic policies in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2, relating to defense against
                            Soviet power and action and to the threat to U.S. economy and
                            institutions; but we should be ready to increase certain military and
                            mobilization programs as required to support our policies and to meet
                            anticipated increases in Soviet capabilities.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Council then considered the statement of policy in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 paragraph by paragraph. With
                        reference to paragraph 4,<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">
                            <p>Paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 reads:</p>
                            <p>“This situation could create a condition of mutual deterrence, in
                                which each side would be strongly inhibited from deliberately
                                initiating general war or taking actions which it regarded as
                                materially increasing the risk of general war. However, the free
                                world powers are becoming increasingly cautious about joining in
                                actions which they believe will enhance the risk of war, while the
                                Soviet rulers will most probably believe that they can take
                                increasingly positive actions without running substantial risk of
                                war. On the other hand, they will continue to have great respect for
                                U.S. nuclear power, to be uncertain of what actions may provoke its
                                use, [and to refrain from actions which promise only local gains
                                while carrying the risk of leading to the use of this power against
                                the USSR.]”</p>
                            <p>The bracketed portion is annotated as follows: “Defense, <gloss
                                    target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                    >JCS</gloss> dissent.”</p>
                        </note> the President said he thought the speculation as to whether the
                        Soviets will or will not become bolder was largely an academic exercise. In
                        this paper we were only trying to establish the broadest <pb xml:id="pg_703"
                            n="703" facs="0733"/>lines of policy, and many future situations will
                        have to be dealt with when they arise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said the issue was
                        whether, in our forward planning, we should assume the Russians would be
                        bolder or less bold as a result of their growing atomic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that the
                        latter part of the paragraph contained a series of balanced guesses. He
                        wondered whether such speculation was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> felt that the
                        Council need not engage in such speculation, even though the Central
                        Intelligence Agency was compelled to do so.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> suggested that
                        the last sentence of paragraph 4 be omitted.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said it might be
                        important to speculate as to what would happen in specific situations—for
                        example, what would happen if the Chinese Communists intervened in
                        Indochina—but it was difficult to speculate on whether or not the Soviet
                        bloc would become bolder in the total world picture.</p>
                    <p>The President said that paragraph 4, after the phrase “risk of war” in the
                        seventh line, might well be deleted and a sentence added to the paragraph to
                        the effect that Soviet reaction to this condition cannot accurately be
                        foreseen, but the free world must remain on the <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> called attention to the
                        different views with respect to paragraph 7,<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">

                        inquired whether the air-to-air rocket program had been mentioned in <gloss

                            see <ref target="#pg_609">p. 609</ref>.</note> He thought perhaps
                        details of this nature should be mentioned in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5408 rather than in this broad paper. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> replied that the air-to-air
                        rocket program was not mentioned in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408
                        because it was brought to the attention of the Council in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Sprague</persName> recommendations after the
                        adoption of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408. The President said we
                        could still take the <persName corresp="#p_SPRAGUERC1">Sprague</persName>
                        recommendations very seriously, even though we did <pb xml:id="pg_704"
                            n="704" facs="0734"/>not mention them in the broad guidelines paper. He
                        felt that if we mentioned details such as the air-to-air rocket we might
                        also have to mention such things as atomic artillery, Nike, etc. He added
                        that if the air-to-air rocket program was of sufficient importance, a
                        recommendation that it be given priority could be submitted to him in a
                        separate memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled that
                        the Council, in considering <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408, has
                        agreed that both military and non-military programs for continental defense
                        should be carried forward as rapidly as possible, but he did not feel that
                        it was necessary to have specific dates for their completion in the
                        guidelines paper. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> agreed that sometimes dates, if mentioned in a paper,
                        tend to become more important than the substance of the paper. He was
                        opposed to emphasizing dates. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> inquired whether the dates in paragraph 7 meant
                        that we would go ahead and attempt to meet those deadlines even if it were
                        not feasible or operationally desirable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said this was not the case.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that we
                        should accelerate continental defense programs, including early warning, and
                        that in particular we should adopt a crash approach to the air-to-air rocket
                        program, which was of such importance as to warrant an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision. The President said it was quite
                        proper for the Council to record its great concern. The Council could say
                        that the air-to-air rocket program was so important as to be almost vital,
                        and could decide that it should have top priority. However, he agreed with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> that the
                        mention of specific dates in a policy paper tended to concentrate too much
                        effort on merely meeting the deadline instead of on the best solution. He
                        had no objection to an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> recommendation as
                        to the high priority of this program, but he did object to deadlines. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said the Planning
                        Board has inserted dates in this paragraph because of intelligence estimates
                        which seemed to indicate that the time of greatest danger of a Soviet
                        nuclear attack on the United States would be mid-1957. The President said he
                        had no objection to including an estimate of the time of greatest
                        danger.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TALBOTTHE1">Talbott</persName> said that
                        forcing completion of a program by a specific date might actually delay the
                        best solution to a problem and compel the use of inadequate materials.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that
                        the paragraph might be revised along the line of giving continental defense
                        programs very high priority, having in mind what the Soviet capabilities
                        would be by 1957. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> said the problem was not one of industrial
                        bottlenecks, but of lack of scientific and technical knowledge and of
                        trained people. The President said that he understood that the Planning
                        Board had put dates in this paragraph in order to emphasize the importance
                        of <pb xml:id="pg_705" n="705" facs="0735"/>the continental defense
                        programs. He felt, however, that their importance could be emphasized
                        without using dates.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that it was
                        estimated that the Soviets would reach a high capability for nuclear attack
                        by July 1957. However, he noted that use of the term “high priority”, or
                        “highest priority”, is often upsetting at the lower levels of the Pentagon.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that
                        priorities might be upsetting, but that they often got results. He felt we
                        would never be ready to defend against an attack unless we estimated the
                        date of the attack and made our preparations accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PETERSONV1">Peterson</persName> called
                        attention to difficulties being experienced in the ground observer program.
                        He said it was difficult to get civilian volunteers at a time when the
                        military departments had not been able to complete their continental defense
                        programs—for example, picket ships. He was willing to leave the dates out of
                        this paragraph, but he understood that some people felt that not everything
                        is being done that could be done to accelerate the continental defense
                        programs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said
                        he would be agreeable to stating in this paragraph that the continental
                        defense programs should have a very high priority.</p>
                    <p>The President wondered whether or not quarterly outline progress reports on
                        certain important continental defense programs should not be submitted to
                        the Council. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should have regular
                        reports on anything of great importance, such as the air-to-air rocket
                        program. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> endorsed
                        the idea of quarterly progress reports. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> hoped that such reports would
                        be no more than two or three pages long. The President said the kind of
                        reports he was talking about might cover no more than two or three lines per
                        project.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> hoped that it
                        would be understood that the clause in paragraph 7, “continental defense
                        programs set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408”, would
                        include the air-to-air rocket program. He feared that the Soviets would
                        attain a high capability to attack the United States by 1957 but that our
                        continental defense programs would not be ready before 1959. He then called
                        attention to the need for expanding the electronics industry in connection
                        with continental defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TALBOTTHE1"
                            >Talbott</persName> said that every effort was being made to take care
                        of electronics needs. The President said he would like a memorandum prepared
                        for his information on the status of the electronics industry in relation to
                        national security policies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether
                        there was any deliberate holding back on the early warning program in order
                        to synchronize it with the programs for destroying enemy bombers. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> replied that the two
                        programs were going forward independently. Early warning, he added, would be
                        valuable as a means of enabling <pb xml:id="pg_706" n="706" facs="0736"
                        />dispersal of the civilian population, even if programs for destruction of
                        enemy bombers were not ready. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> emphasized that early warning was also a deterrent
                        factor in so far as it helped us protect our retaliatory capability.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to paragraph 9,<note n="7" xml:id="d122fn7">
                            <p>Paragraph 9 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 reads:</p>
                            <p>“If general war should occur, the United States should wage it with
                                all available weapons and should continue to make clear its
                                determination to do so.”</p>
                        </note> which indicated that in the event of general war the United States
                        would use all available weapons and would make clear its determination to do
                        so. The President inquired to whom we were going to make this clear. Some
                        limitation appeared to be necessary in the paragraph, since we obviously did
                        not want to make this clear to everybody.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that the
                        paragraph should be revised to say that our planning should be based on the
                        assumption that if general war occurs we will use all available weapons. He
                        did not think it desirable to have the paragraph contain a mandate to boast
                        of our nuclear capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> referred to a
                        memorandum he had received from the Army, stating that general war might be
                        fought under varying conditions, including (1) a situation in which nuclear
                        weapons have been used but have failed to produce a decision, and (2) a
                        situation in which nuclear weapons have not been used by either side and are
                        still available to each side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said that the question of mutual deterrents after
                        both sides had reached atomic plenty might require further study. However,
                        he thought it was understood that the United States could not have both
                        large standing armies and great nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> at this point
                        noted the Joint Chiefs of Staff view that the guidelines paper needed a
                        complete overhaul. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        then read the memorandum, “Department of Defense Position on <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1”, distributed at the meeting (copy
                        filed in the minutes).<note n="8" xml:id="d122fn8">Memorandum not found; for
                            information on the minutes of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            meetings, see <ref target="#d78fn1">footnote 1</ref>, p. 394.</note> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> questioned the phrase
                        in the second sentence of this memorandum, “the Department of Defense would
                        continue the strength and composition of forces substantially as at
                        present”. After rereading this sentence Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> agreed that it should have been
                        phrased “strength and composition of forces substantially as presently
                        planned”.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that if,
                        in our opinion, the United States must use all available weapons in order to
                        survive in the event of general war, we should proceed at once to prepare
                        U.S. and allied public opinion for the use of such weapons. The President
                        doubted the wisdom of preparing world opinion for some of the things we <pb
                            xml:id="pg_707" n="707" facs="0737"/>may have to do in case of war. He
                        thought it would be better to continue to emphasize constructive peace. To
                        attempt to educate public opinion now on the weapons that might have to be
                        used in war might produce very great strain on our alliances. He felt it was
                        possible to talk to the U.K. leaders in a realistic way on this subject, but
                        educating British public opinion would be a very different matter.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then referred to
                        a request he had received from General <persName corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1"
                            >Collins</persName> that the statement on the U.S. position regarding
                        nuclear weapons, read by the Secretary of State at the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in Paris on April 23, 1954,<note

                        made available to members of the Standing Group of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> added that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had approved of
                        this statement and thought it could be useful in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> military planning. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that his statement of
                        April 23, which had been carefully prepared in collaboration with Defense,
                        could be used by the military planners as they thought wise.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the question of preparing public opinion for the use of nuclear
                        weapons, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed
                        with the President’s approach. He said that talk of atomic attack tended to
                        create “peace-at-any-price people” and might lead to an increase of
                        appeasement sentiment in various countries. The Russians are smarter on this
                        question because they never talk about using atomic weapons. The President
                        said the Russians had mentioned atomic weapons from time to time. For
                        instance, they have said that the United States no longer has an atomic
                        monopoly.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said the
                        Department of Defense expected to continue the 1955 force levels through
                        1956; that it would price these force levels with continental defense
                        programs added, and take a new look at its plans about December 1. The
                        President remarked that war plans were never completed. He thought that war
                        planning was the heart and soul of the military machine because planning
                        kept everyone on his toes, but the plan itself was probably not worth very
                        much. He added that it was frustrating not to have plans to use nuclear
                        weapons generally accepted. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> said that the idea of using nuclear weapons involved
                        a big change in military thinking, and that it took time to get everyone to
                        accept this change.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to the problem of local Communist aggression.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out
                        that the second sentence of paragraph 12<note n="10" xml:id="d122fn10">
                            <p>Paragraph 12 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 reads:</p>
                            <p>“To permit appropriate flexibility in the capability of deterring or
                                defeating local aggressions, the U.S. should be prepared to defeat
                                such aggressions without necessarily initiating general war. This
                                requires that the U.S. maintain and be ready to use for this purpose
                                requisite U.S. forces in conjunction with indigenous forces,
                                supplemented by U.S. logistical support and by available support
                                from other nations acting under U.N. or regional commitments.
                                However, the U.S. must be determined to take, unilaterally if
                                necessary, whatever additional action its security requires, even to
                                the extent of general war, and the Communists must be convinced of
                                this determination.”</p>
                        </note> required the United States to use U.S. forces in <pb xml:id="pg_708"
                            n="708" facs="0738"/>defeating local aggressions. He had thought that
                        the principal factor restraining local aggression by the Communists was the
                        deterrent nuclear power of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the theory of retaliation falls down unless we can
                        identify the aggressor. In many cases aggression consists of subversion or
                        civil war in a country rather than overt attack on that country. In such
                        cases it is difficult for us to know whom to retaliate against.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> suggested that
                        paragraph 12 be omitted. He felt the United States would have to determine
                        its policy on a case-by-case basis. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that in negotiations for
                        a Southeast Asia pact he had been proceeding on the assumption that there
                        would be no build-up of U.S. military power in Southeast Asia sufficient to
                        stop an aggressor. The second sentence of paragraph 12 would require
                        building up a great Southeast Asia force similar to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                        U.S. forces used against local aggression might be mobile forces and would
                        therefore not necessarily be stationed in the area threatened by aggression.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that
                        paragraph 12 meant that we would have to keep another 200, 000 men ready to
                        move in the direction of local aggression. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had already warned
                        the countries that might participate with us in a Southeast Asia pact that
                        the United States would not be stationing large military forces in Southeast
                        Asia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> referred
                        to the idea sometimes advanced, that we might use air and naval forces
                        against aggression without committing ground forces. He was opposed to this
                        idea; he thought we should not send our Air Force or Navy into combat if we
                        were not willing to commit the Army also.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired what
                        would happen if the Chinese Communists helped Indonesian Communists seize
                        one of the Indonesian islands. Would we passively accept this situation, or
                        would we use U.S. forces to clean it up?</p>
                    <p>The President said that it would be fatal to our national security to have
                        relatively immobile U.S. forces stationed all around the globe. If major war
                        occurred while we were in such a situation we would be helpless. He thought
                        we had to depend on the indigenous <pb xml:id="pg_709" n="709" facs="0739"
                        />victims of aggression for some of the fighting. If people don’t want to be
                        free and won’t fight for freedom, he added, there is not much we can do. But
                        if they fight hard and need help, we can send the Marines and the Air Force.
                        The United States can’t become an armed camp. If we get many more divisions
                        tied down the way we have some tied down in Korea now, we will have to go to
                        general mobilization.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        paragraph 12 stated the kind of situation that is most likely to occur, and
                        should therefore receive very careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that even
                        though we could not, as pointed out by the President, station troops all
                        around the world, we nevertheless might want to use U.S. forces to clean up
                        certain situations. The President agreed that this was indeed the case.</p>
                    <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> said that he was compelled to leave the meeting to
                        go to the Hill and try to get the debt limit raised in order that Uncle Sam
                        could pay his bills for the next few months. He added that he did not expect
                        the debt ceiling to be raised very much, and that hereafter he would have to
                        request that it be raised again every time a deficit occurred. A deficit of
                        $4.1 billion was now contemplated. Budgetary receipts might be enough less
                        than anticipated so that the deficit would become $5 billion unless
                        expenditures were reduced. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> therefore suggested (1) that all programs be put on
                        an austerity basis, and (2) that if we decided we <hi rend="italic"
                            >must</hi> have something new and cannot get it by readjusting approved
                        programs, we should go back to Congress and ask for a tax increase. In other
                        words, we should pay as we go. He added that he was not suggesting that we
                        give up anything we really need for national security, but the need should
                        be so great that we should be willing to ask for more taxes.</p>
                    <p>The President believed that no one would disagree with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. However, he said, there is
                        another side to the picture. If we do need some new program for our national
                        security, let’s not quarrel with the consequences. For instance, if we need
                        an air-to-air rocket program, let’s not be afraid to say so and ask for the
                        taxes to get it. The President added that we were always trying to eliminate
                        unnecessary expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that of
                        course two-thirds of our expenditures related to defense, but not all the
                        unnecessary expenditures occurred in Defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, with reference
                        to paragraph 13–d,<note n="11" xml:id="d122fn11">

                        </note> Mr. <persName>Hughes</persName> said that the clause “recognizing

                        expenditures, should be made as required”, appeared to confer blanket
                        authority for continuous increase of expenditures. The Bureau of the Budget
                        felt that any increased expenditures should result from the process of
                        normal budgetary review rather than from a paragraph in an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the insertion in paragraph 14 proposed by Budget,
                        “through revision of priorities”, meant that each new program would displace
                        some old program. Mr. <persName>Hughes</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative. The President said that it would not always be possible to
                        eliminate an old program in order to make room for a new one, but that an
                        effort in this direction should of course be made in each case.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> saw no need for
                        this paragraph. He added that Defense should not always be asked to knock
                        out something old in order to get something new.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the
                        paragraph might indicate that efforts would be made to adjust priorities
                        when a new program was proposed, and that ultimate decisions would be
                        subject to the normal budgetary processes.</p>
                    <p>The President said that a new program would have a greater chance of adoption
                        if it did not require an increase in over-all expenditures. He felt sure,
                        however, that the military departments were aware of the importance of a
                        sound economy and that the <pb xml:id="pg_711" n="711" facs="0741"/>normal
                        budgetary processes were a sufficient check on expenditures.</p>

                        was not readily attainable. Our allies will not go to general war to halt
                        indirect aggression.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> what we would do if Indonesia openly embraced
                        Communism. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                        we probably would have to take some action such as supporting non-Communist
                        elements in a counterrevolution and imposing a naval blockade. He believed,
                        however, that Britain and France would refuse to take any action in this
                        contingency. The President said there was some evidence that the British
                        were becoming more amenable to our point of view.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> wished to

                            <p>Paragraph 18 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/1 reads:</p>
                            <p>“The relative susceptibility of much of free Asia to the Communist
                                tactic of creeping expansion requires that the U.S. devote greater
                                efforts than heretofore to this region. The U.S. should exert its
                                leadership in the Pacific toward the creation of a position of
                                strength calculated to block Communist expansion [and eventually to
                                contract Communist-controlled areas and power] in the Far East and
                                Southeast Asia. In its Pacific role, the United States should be
                                less influenced by European allies than in respect to Atlantic
                                affairs.”</p>
                            <p>The bracketed portion is annotated as follows: “Proposed by Defense
                                and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.”</p>
                        </note> which, if the bracketed clause were retained, would be the only
                        paragraph in the paper pointing toward a rollback of Soviet power. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> hoped that the
                        bracketed clause in paragraph 18 would be omitted, because it implied that
                        the rollback would take place only in Asia. He thought there should be
                        long-range plans for a rollback in the satellites, in Iran, etc., but he
                        wished to emphasize that these plans would have to be very long-range
                        indeed.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that a paragraph of the paper might indicate that
                        while the time of a significant rollback was far in the future, nevertheless
                        we should watch any opportunities and prepare plans for an earlier
                        contracting of Soviet power.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had no
                        objection to inclusion of the bracketed sentence in paragraph 20.<note

                            <p>“The U.S. should attempt to gain maximum support from the free world,
                                both allies and uncommitted countries, for the collective measures
                                necessary to prevent Communist expansion. As a broad rule of
                                conduct, the U.S. should pursue its objectives in such ways and by
                                such means, including appropriate pressures, persuasion, and
                                compromise, as will maintain the cohesion of the alliances. The U.S.
                                should, however, act independently of its major allies when the
                                advantage of achieving U.S. objectives by such action clearly
                                outweighs the danger of lasting damage to its alliances. [In this
                                connection, consideration should be given to the likelihood that the
                                initiation of action by the U.S. prior to allied acceptance may
                                bring about subsequent allied support.] Allied reluctance to act
                                should not inhibit the U.S. from taking action, including the use of
                                nuclear weapons, to prevent Communist territorial gains when such
                                action is clearly necessary to U.S. security.”</p>
                        </note> The President added that <pb xml:id="pg_712" n="712" facs="0742"

                        estimate. In this connection the President expressed some doubt that a
                        strong U.S. initiative toward arming Germany would be a means of compelling
                        the ratification of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> wondered whether
                        the term “reduced barriers” in paragraph 24–d also included the idea of not
                        raising barriers. The President thought the term probably referred to the
                        total effect; that is, a few barriers might go up, but most of them would
                        come down, so that the net effect would be one of reduction. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested that
                        paragraph 24–d should state that the principles contained in the President’s

                                to produce newer weapons to replace those which have become
                                obsolete. Under present projections for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                    >FY</gloss> 1957, $10 billion of the total military hard goods

                                missiles and ships, leaving only $2.5 billion for all other items.
                                In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 expenditures for such
                                other items were $6.8 billion.</p>
                            <p>“Should general war commence in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                1957, the U.S., even if it should escape damage by enemy action,
                                could produce only about $36 billion of end items within 12 months
                                of M–Day, as against a current possibility of producing about $55
                                billion of end items in 12 months. These estimated low rates are
                                premised on limitations of end item productive capacity. Essential
                                needs of the civilian economy would impose no limitation on defense
                                hard good production up to a limit of about $70 billion a year.
                                Capacity thus limited, even with end item reserves then in hand,

                        and out of date. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        said he had no objection to bringing the paragraphs up to date, but felt
                        that the basic problem stated in these paragraphs should be pointed out. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said the figures
                        contained in the paragraphs were those provided the Planning Board by the
                        Defense representatives. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> said a <pb xml:id="pg_713" n="713" facs="0743"/>check
                        in Defense had revealed that the figures were wrong. The President said the
                        Council couldn’t pass on this kind of question, and suggested that Defense
                        should be careful hereafter to provide the Planning Board with correct
                        information.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that no
                        plans existed to maintain the present mobilization base after present
                        defense orders run out. He felt that plants working on defense orders should
                        also be working in part on civilian production, so that adjustments between
                        defense and civilian orders could be made as necessary. He would like to see
                        a separate paper prepared on the maintenance of the mobilization base.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said a policy on
                        current production and the mobilization base was being worked out. However,
                        the question must be faced whether we can afford to halt current defense
                        production altogether. We don’t know whether we can afford to let current
                        defense production go below a certain figure. As an example of one way of
                        maintaining current production, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> referred to “upgrading the stockpile”, i.e., taking
                        bauxite out of one stockpile and converting it into aluminum for another
                        stockpile. The President felt that maintaining the mobilization base was of
                        the greatest importance. He endorsed the idea of upgrading the stockpile, as
                        well as the idea that defense contractors should be working partly on
                        civilian needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        suggested that Section III of the paper might be referred to <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, with the collaboration of others, for
                        revision.</p>
                    <p>At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BURNSDAF1">Burns</persName> was asked
                        to present the views of the Council of Economic Advisers on Appendix B,
                        “Fiscal and Budgetary Outlook”. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BURNSDAF1"
                            >Burns</persName> said that the terms “surplus” and “deficit” depended
                        on the method of budgetary accounting. If Social Security income and
                        expenditures were included in the table in Appendix B, the indicated deficit
                        of $3 billion would vanish and something like a balance would be achieved.
                        Moreover, on the receipts side it would be possible to estimate $2 billion
                        more revenue in 1956 by making more optimistic assumptions regarding
                        employment than the authors of the table had made. Finally, the table had
                        been prepared before Congress took action on taxes. As a result of
                        Congressional action, tax receipts would be somewhat higher in 1957. In
                        summary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BURNSDAF1">Burns</persName> said, if
                        optimistic assumptions are adopted the picture is a great deal more rosy
                        than the table in Appendix B indicates. The President said he had no
                        objections to occasional optimism.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Guidelines Under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. Politico-Military Guidelines</p>
                    <p>1. There have been substantial changes in the intelligence estimates of
                        certain current and future Soviet capabilities since the adoption of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2, particularly in regard to the
                        estimates of increased Soviet nuclear capability in weapons and delivery
                        systems. Also, since the adoption of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162/2, unity of action among the free world allies has been increasingly
                        strained by conflicts of interest and by divisive forces. It is estimated
                        that such factors and an increasing fear of Soviet nuclear capabilities will
                        continue to influence adversely the cohesion of our alliances for the
                        foreseeable future, and that the Communist powers are likely to devote
                        greater attention to expanding their control by penetration and subversion,
                        particularly in the underdeveloped areas of the free world. A more complete
                        analysis of the world situation and outlook is set forth in Appendix A to
                        this paper.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect of Increased Nuclear Capabilities</p>
                    <p>2. With the growth both in Soviet nuclear capabilities and in the power of
                        nuclear weapons themselves, in the period 1956–59, a total war involving the
                        strategic use by both sides of nuclear weapons would bring about such
                        extensive destruction as to threaten the survival of Western civilization
                        and the Soviet regime.</p>
                    <p>3. Under these circumstances, the freedom of either side to initiate the use
                        of strategic nuclear bombing against the other may be circumscribed by:</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_717" n="717" facs="0747"/>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The fear of the effects of retaliatory use of such strategic
                            bombing; and</item>
                        <item>b. The possibility that neither side would gain a decisive military
                            advantage from such an exchange of nuclear blows.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>4. This situation could create a condition of mutual deterrence, in which
                        each side would be strongly inhibited from deliberately initiating general
                        war or taking actions which it regarded as materially increasing the risk of
                        general war. However, the free world powers are becoming increasingly
                        cautious about joining in actions which they believe will enhance the risk
                        of war. Because Soviet action under this situation cannot be accurately
                        predicted, the free world will have to be especially vigilant.</p>
                    <p>5. The situation described in pars. 2 and 3 could also tempt the Soviets into
                        attacking the United States if they believed that initial surprise held a
                        prospect of destroying the U.S. retaliatory power before it could be
                        used.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prevention of Soviet Nuclear Attack</p>
                    <p>6. To ensure Soviet fear that strategic nuclear attacks upon the U.S. would
                        be followed by the nuclear devastation of the USSR and the destruction of
                        the Soviet regime, the U.S. should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Maintain the striking forces necessary for such retaliation.</item>
                        <item>b. Take all practicable measures to protect this retaliatory capacity
                            against any foreseeable Soviet attack.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>7. The U.S. should accelerate its military and non-military programs for

                        operationally desirable and give to these programs very high priority,
                        having in mind that it is estimated the Soviets will reach a high capability
                        for strategic nuclear attacks by July 1957.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disarmament</p>
                    <p>8. Despite serious question whether any safe and enforceable system can be
                        achieved in the foreseeable future, the U.S. should nevertheless continue to
                        explore fully the possibility of reaching a practicable arrangement for the
                        limitation of armaments with the USSR. The U.S. should therefore continue to
                        reexamine its position on disarmament, especially (a) whether a promising
                        climate for effective disarmament negotiations can be developed, (b) whether
                        a system of safeguards can be devised entailing less risk for U.S. security
                        than no limitation of armaments, and (c) whether, if a safe and enforceable
                        system for assuring effective nuclear disarmament, which might be acceptable
                        to the USSR, can be devised, the U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_718" n="718"
                            facs="0748"/>would be willing to accept it in the absence of
                        conventional disarmament. Meanwhile, the United States should continue to
                        refuse to accept nuclear disarmament except as part of general
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General War</p>
                    <p>9. Planning should be on the assumption that, if general war should occur,
                        the United States will wage it with all available weapons.</p>
                    <p>10. There is increasing possibility that an important part of the U.S.
                        overseas base complex may become ineffective in the event of general war
                        because of political reasons (including susceptibility of the local
                        government to atomic blackmail) or military reasons (exposure to immediate
                        destruction by enemy action). The U.S. should, while exerting continued
                        efforts to strengthen collective defense arrangements, including the ability
                        to use such bases for nuclear attack in the collective defense of the free
                        world, also increase emphasis on developing self-sufficiency for the conduct
                        of offensive operations exploiting the use of nuclear weapons, consistent
                        with sound military concepts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Local Communist Aggression</p>
                    <p>11. U.S. policy to deter or defeat overt Communist aggression will be
                        accomplished, in part, by the programs described above to maintain and
                        enhance the U.S. capability to wage general war. This capability will
                        continue to be a deterrent to identifiable overt aggression so long as the
                        Communist believe that such aggression could eventually lead to general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>12. To permit appropriate flexibility in the capability of deterring or
                        defeating local aggressions, the U.S. should be prepared to defeat such
                        aggressions without necessarily initiating general war. For this purpose the
                        U.S. should be prepared to assist, with U.S. logistical support and if
                        necessary with mobile U.S. forces, indigenous forces supplemented by
                        available support from other nations acting under UN or regional
                        commitments. However, the U.S. must be determined to take, unilaterally if
                        necessary, whatever additional action its security requires, even to the
                        extent of general war, and the Communists must be convinced of this
                        determination.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Expansion Other Than by Overt
                        Aggression</p>
                    <p>13. An immediate and most serious threat to the free world is further
                        Communist expansion through subversion, indirect aggression, and the
                        instigation or exploitation of civil wars in free world countries, as in
                        Indochina, rather than direct armed aggression. The advantages of this
                        strategy, if successful, lie in the continued accretions to Communist
                        strength and prestige and the progressive <pb xml:id="pg_719" n="719"
                            facs="0749"/>weakening of the free world coalition, both politically and
                        militarily, while the involvement of the main sources of Communist power is
                        avoided. Moreover, these methods make it very difficult for the U.S. to
                        respond primarily by military means. The U.S. can best meet this threat of
                        piecemeal conquest by a flexible combination of political, psychological,
                        economic and military actions. In view of the loss of Northern Vietnam, the
                        U.S. cannot passively accept further significant extension of Communist
                        control. It must act, both in relation to the Communist powers and to the
                        peoples of threatened areas, so as to prevent such extension of control. In
                        particular, the U.S. should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Seek more than military solutions to the varied aspects of the
                            Soviet-Communist threat, and create an understanding in the free world
                            that such is the U.S. objective.</item>
                        <item>b. Make increased efforts to develop and carry out cooperative
                            programs, not necessarily overtly anti-communist, designed to advance
                            the political and economic strength of underdeveloped areas, along lines
                            indicated in Section II below.</item>
                        <item>c. Take all feasible political, economic and covert measures to
                            counter the threat of groups or forces responsive to communist control
                            to achieve dominant power in a free world country.</item>
                        <item>d. Provide military aid and training and defense support to threatened
                            areas where such aid can effectively contribute to internal stability or
                            the creation of strength in regional areas.</item>
                        <item>e. In instances of civil war, be prepared, with maximum free world

                    <p>15. Major allies will continue to be essential to the U.S. to prevent the
                        loss of major free areas to Communist control and the gradual isolation of
                        the U.S. However, increasing elements of division and weakness in free world
                        alliances may make it difficult to <pb xml:id="pg_720" n="720" facs="0750"
                        />take decisive collective action to halt further Soviet expansion,
                        particularly in Asia.</p>
                    <p>16. In these circumstances, and recognizing the necessity to create, prior to
                        the achievement of mutual atomic plenty, conditions under which the United
                        States and the free world coalition are prepared to meet the
                        Soviet-Communist threat with resolution and to negotiate for its alleviation
                        under proper safeguards, the U.S. should take action as practicable:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. To overcome the divisive factors mentioned in paragraph 5–b of
                            Appendix A and to strengthen the cohesion of the alliances under U.S.
                            leadership.</item>
                        <item>b. To convince its allies that U.S. policies and actions take due
                            account of their security as well as its own and that the U.S. and its
                            allies will be able to meet the threat of aggression even in case of
                            nuclear balance.</item>
                        <item>c. To seek to persuade its allies of the necessity to halt further
                            significant Communist expansion, direct or indirect.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>17. The U.S. should continue to help build political, economic, and military
                        strength and cohesion in Western Europe, which is a major source of free
                        world power, provides our principal allies, and plays an essential role in
                        preventing Soviet expansion.</p>
                    <p>18. The relative susceptibility of much of free Asia to the Communist tactic
                        of creeping expansion requires that the U.S. devote greater efforts than
                        heretofore to this region. The U.S. should exert its leadership in the
                        Pacific toward the creation of a position of strength calculated to block
                        Communist expansion in the Far East and Southeast Asia. In its Pacific role,
                        the United States should be less influenced by European allies than in
                        respect to Atlantic affairs.</p>
                    <p>19. The U.S. should direct its efforts in areas of the free world, other than
                        Europe and Asia, on a selective basis aimed at influencing for the better
                        situations potentially adverse to its important security interest.</p>
                    <p>20. Although the time for a significant rollback of Soviet power may appear
                        to be in the future, the U.S. should be prepared, by feasible current
                        actions or future planning, to take advantage of any earlier opportunity to
                        contract Communist-controlled areas and power.</p>
                    <p>21. The U.S. should attempt to gain maximum support from the free world, both
                        allies and uncommitted countries, for the collective measures necessary to
                        prevent Communist expansion. As a broad rule of conduct, the U.S. should
                        pursue its objectives in such ways and by such means, including appropriate
                        pressures, persuasion, and compromise, as will maintain the cohesion of the
                        alliances. The U.S. should, however, act independently of its major <pb
                            xml:id="pg_721" n="721" facs="0751"/>allies when the advantage of
                        achieving U.S. objectives by such action clearly outweighs the danger of
                        lasting damage to its alliances. In this connection, consideration should be
                        given to the likelihood that the initiation of action by the U.S. prior to
                        allied acceptance may bring about subsequent allied support. Allied
                        reluctance to act should not inhibit the U.S. from taking action, including
                        the use of nuclear weapons, to prevent Communist territorial gains when such
                        action is clearly necessary to U.S. security.</p>
                    <p>22. With respect to those uncommitted or underdeveloped areas of the free
                        world which are the most likely targets for Communist expansion,
                        particularly in Asia, the U.S. should:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Undertake a new initiative designed to improve the political and
                            economic stability of those nations, to enhance their will and ability
                            to maintain their independence against Communist pressures and possible
                            aggression, and to counter the influences exercised by the Communist
                            powers.</item>
                        <item>b. Seek their cooperation on a basis of mutual self-respect without
                            attempting to make active allies of those not so inclined, and refrain,
                            so far as feasible, from taking or supporting actions which run counter
                            to the forces of anti-colonialism and legitimate nationalism.</item>

                    <p>23. Economic Development The U.S. should, as a major objective of its policy,
                        help accelerate present rates of economic growth in the under-developed
                        areas, particularly in South and Southeast Asia and parts of Latin America.
                        Measures to assist and guide economic development should include continuing
                        technical assistance, exchange programs, encouragement of U.S. private
                        investment in these countries, and greater self-help on their part. With
                        respect to important development programs which cannot be financed by local
                        or foreign capital or U.S. private capital, the U.S. Government should
                        assist countries where accelerated rates of growth are required for the
                        attainment of U.S. objectives and where such assistance will be used
                        effectively. Such assistance may be required on a larger scale than the
                        present country programs. However, the total level of U.S. economic
                        assistance worldwide should be progressively reduced so far as is consistent
                        with U.S. security objectives.</p>
                    <p>24. Regional economic action. In addition to bilateral actions and existing
                        multilateral institutions, the U.S. should encourage regional economic
                        actions and groupings to promote increased trade, technical cooperation, and
                        investment, and to concert sound development plans. Specifically, the U.S.
                        should take the initiative in free Asia by encouraging free Asian countries
                        to form ties of closer economic cooperation and to prepare a sound regional
                        economic program, based upon mutual self-help and the cooperation and

                        a program and encourage such industrialized countries to participate in and

                        account of the need for developing and maintaining the strength of foreign
                        forces indicated in pars. 12, 13–d, 17 and 18 above, pending the scheduled
                        review of this subject by the National Security Council. Such review will
                        include the development of more flexible over-all procedures for providing
                        U.S. military assistance to foreign nations to meet changing world
                        conditions and in accordance with the availability of end items; relative
                        priority among recipient nations; and the extent to which such nations can
                        meet their needs from their own resources. The U.S. should also determine
                        the extent to which the national interest requires that post D-day military
                        aid requirements of our allies be included in national security
                        programs.</p>

                    <p>29. The Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Budget have prepared a
                        budget outlook for fiscal years 1956 and 1957, which assumes continuance of
                        major national security programs and foreign economic aid, as heretofore
                        formulated under currently established policies, and continuation of the
                        present policy of reducing all other expenditures to the maximum extent
                        possible (see Appendix B). [The figures appearing in item 3 of the table in

                        <item>a. The internal stability of the Soviet Union and its control of the
                            European satellites have not diminished and may be expected to remain
                            intact through 1959.</item>
                        <item>b. However, the Soviet bloc is faced with internal problems such as
                            popular discontent in the satellites, agricultural shortages and
                            opposition to collectivization, rivalries within the collective
                            leadership and serious defections from the secret services.</item>
                        <item>c. Communist China has gained prestige more rapidly than anticipated;
                            its power will continue to increase. Despite potential conflicts of
                            interest, the present close Sino-Soviet collaboration will
                            persist.</item>

                        <item>a. Present and future Soviet Bloc capabilities for expansion by action
                            short of general war appear, in the light of developments in Indochina
                            and at Geneva, greater than a year ago. Throughout most of the free
                            world, especially in Asia, the Communists have the capability through
                            hardcore activists to engage in a wide variety of forms of penetration
                            and subversion, ranging from organized civil war (as in Indochina)
                            through persistent guerrilla activities (as in Malaya) to inflammatory
                            demonstrations, propaganda, “popular fronts,” and parliamentary
                            harassment. The Communists will therefore increase their emphasis on a
                            “creeping expansion” in preference to overt aggression, and they will
                            continue to take over spontaneous movements bred of nationalistic fervor
                            or economic discontent and to exploit free world disunity.</item>
                        <item>b. In the period through 1959, the Soviet rulers will almost certainly
                            believe that, as Soviet nuclear capabilities increase, the aversion of
                            the U.S. and, more especially, of its allies to general war will
                            correspondingly increase, and that the Kremlin will therefore have
                            greater freedom to take certain actions, including local military
                            actions, without running substantial risk of general war [in situations
                            where the allies would be likely to act as a brake on the United
                                States.]<note n="‡" xml:id="d123fn-sym7">Proposed by State.
                                [Footnote and brackets in the source text.]</note> The Kremlin may
                            employ the threat of nuclear devastation as an instrument of political
                            warfare. The Kremlin will, however, continue to be extremely reluctant
                            to precipitate a contest in which the USSR would be subjected to nuclear
                            attack. At the same time, the Kremlin would probably not be deterred by
                            the risk of general war from taking counteraction against an action by
                            the U.S. or its allies which the Kremlin considered an imminent threat
                            to Soviet security. The extent to which the Kremlin uses the increased
                            freedom of action which its increased nuclear capabilities appear to
                            give it, and the success which it achieves, will depend primarily on the
                            cohesion of the non-Communist world, and the determination and strength
                            of the major free world powers.</item>

                            period and prior to like achievement by the Soviets. The U.S. is
                            expected to maintain relative numerical and qualitative superiority <pb

                            means for their delivery. As the Soviets approach the absolute atomic
                            capability of inflicting critical damage upon U.S. and other allied
                            targets, however, there could result a condition of mutual deterrence to
                            general war.</item>
                        <item>b. Free world forces will be confronted with quantitative superiority
                            in ground and tactical air forces in the geographical areas contiguous
                            to the Soviet Bloc. However, the superior tactical atomic support which
                            can be provided our allies during this period will, if accepted by them,
                            partially offset allied deficiencies in conventional forces. Taken as a
                            whole, effectiveness of European forces is considered fair to good.
                            There has been no progress in forming West German forces and limited
                            progress in forming Japanese forces. Events in the Far East resulted in
                            a suspension of planned redeployments from that area. D-day <gloss

                            remain unchanged. No progress has been made in forming a strategic
                            reserve based generally on U.S. territory, with a high degree of combat
                            readiness and a capability of being moved to any threatened area.</item>

                        <item>a. There have been serious instances of an unwillingness of important
                            free world nations to take concerted action which the U.S. considers
                            necessary to oppose communist expansion, particularly as regards
                            Indochina, East-West trade, and <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>.
                            West Germany is becoming restive because of protracted delay in
                            recovering its sovereignty. The long-term alignment of Japan with the
                            free world has become less certain. The situation with respect to
                            Indochina has deteriorated with unexpected rapidity, confronting the
                            free world with the possible loss of Southeast Asia to communism and
                            causing, in the continued absence of effective countermeasures, loss of
                            confidence, particularly in the Far East, as to the willingness and
                            ability of the free world to prevent further losses to Communism.</item>

                    <p>The underdeveloped areas of the free world will be especially vulnerable to
                        Communist penetration and subversion by reason of nationalism and
                        anti-colonialism, deep-seated distrust of the West, retarded economic
                        growth, military weakness, political ferment. Strong pressures will result
                        from impatience to achieve political and economic aspirations. Failure of
                        the local governments to provide some satisfaction of these aspirations will
                        create additional trouble and disunity in the free world while benefiting
                        the Soviet bloc and will increase the dangers of Communist take-over of
                        independent countries without armed aggression from outside. This danger
                        will be most acute in Asia, in dependent areas such as French North Africa
                        which are still under European rule, and in parts of Latin America.</p>

                        present excise taxes on liquor, tobacco, gasoline and automobiles, which
                        under existing law will be reduced on April 1, 1955 with resulting tax
                        losses of $1.2 billion in 1956 and $1.1 billion in 1957. The figures do
                        assume, however, that the 52 percent corporate tax rate will not be extended
                        beyond April 1, 1955. Allowance is made in these figures for the anticipated
                        growth of the economy. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                    <p>§Reduction in individual income tax rates when the corporate tax rate is
                        reduced on April 1, 1955 and additional individual and corporate rate
                        reductions during 1956. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                    <p>2. Actual receipts in fiscal 1954 were $64.6 billion. Revised estimates for
                        fiscal 1955 are $58.7 billion.</p>
                    <p>3. The revenue estimates in the table are based on an assumption that
                        practical full employment (approximately 2.5 million unemployed) will be
                        restored by the middle of calendar year 1956, that personal income will be
                        $300 billion in the calendar year 1955 and $315 billion in 1956, and that
                        corporate profits will be $39 billion in 1955 and $40 billion in 1956.</p>
                    <p>4. Personal income in 1953 was $286 billion and was at the rate of $285
                        billion in May, 1954. Corporate profits were $39.4 billion in 1953 and at
                        the rate of $34.5 billion in the first quarter of 1954. They are assumed to
                        be $36.4 billion for the calendar year 1954 for purposes of the fiscal 1955
                        receipts estimate.</p>
                    <p>5. The economic assumptions underlying receipts for fiscal 1956 and 1957 have
                        been agreed upon by the Treasury Department, the Bureau of the Budget, and
                        the Council of Economic Advisers, except for the rate of recovery to a
                        practical full employment level and the projected level of corporate profits
                        for calendar 1955 and 1956. On the basis of an assumption by the Council of
                        Economic Advisers of a recovery which would result in full employment on the
                        average during calendar 1955 and a higher level of corporate profits for
                        1955 and 1956 than that assumed by the Treasury Department and the Bureau of
                        the Budget, estimated receipts for fiscal years 1956 and 1957 would be
                        increased by $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively over the figures
                        decided upon for use in budget forecasts.</p>
                    <p>6. The expenditure estimates in the table represent the best judgment of the
                        Bureau of the Budget as to expenditure levels that would result from a
                        continuance of existing policies. It has been <pb xml:id="pg_731" n="731"
                            facs="0761"/>necessary to make assumptions as to final congressional
                        action on appropriation bills not yet enacted and on pending legislation,
                        which might affect the figures materially. In accordance with established
                        procedure new projections will be made after Congress adjourns to give the
                        President the budget outlook based on final action by the Congress.</p>
                    <p>7. Estimates for relatively uncontrollable and other non-<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> programs are based on the present policy of
                        reducing expenditures to the maximum extent possible. They assume that the
                        administration will successfully resist pressures to increase certain
                        Government activities and benefit payments. The increase from 1956 to 1957
                        results from programs initiated in 1955 (e.g., expanded highways and
                        merchant ship construction) which involve larger expenditures in later
                        years.</p>
                    <p>8. The levels of expenditure for national security and foreign aid programs
                        are estimates by the Bureau of the Budget under present established policies
                        and programs. The momentum of reductions under present policies will, of
                        course, carry forward to a certain extent through 1956 and 1957, but no
                        other adjustments or reductions have been assumed for these years.</p></frus:attachment>

                        completed military end items and capacity to produce them) is stronger now
                        than ever before in peacetime. Facilities actively producing matériel

                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 will be adequate, the following must be
                        taken into account:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The hard goods output figures set forth above assume maximum
                            acceleration in program categories, without regard to the probable
                            required acceleration for each item.</item>
                        <item>b. The mobilization base for production of military hard goods is
                            spotty. Large deficiencies exist in U.S. capacity to produce important
                            components.</item>
                        <item>c. The availability of existing capacity does not make allowance for
                            damage by enemy action for which the USSR has a rapidly growing
                            capability. 63% of the general industrial capacity of the U.S. is
                            located in 53 metropolitan target areas. The forthcoming net
                            capabilities evaluation study will provide guidance as to this
                            factor.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>33. Even if the above estimates of wartime output of hard goods are accurate,
                        it is not now known whether such output would be adequate to provide
                        logistic support of our own forces and our essential allies. Current U.S.
                        logistic planning is handicapped by lack of agreed wartime requirements.
                        Such planning is now based on unilateral Service estimates. Mobilization
                        plans do not include provision for the logistic support of essential allies
                        which may be determined to be necessary. At present the known production
                        capacity, plus existing stocks, of such allies is generally inadequate to
                        support their requirements. Until wartime requirements of U.S. logistic
                        support for our allies can be determined and combined with more adequate
                        estimates of U.S. requirements, it will not be known whether the U.S.
                        mobilization base can provide necessary logistic support in the event of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>34. The United States should maintain its mobilization potential generally
                        within the framework of the policy stated in pars. 34 and 40 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 and in line with the general
                        considerations stated in pars. 9 and 10 thereof. Effective implementation of
                        this policy is dependent upon early completion of wartime plans and the
                        determination <pb xml:id="pg_735" n="735" facs="0765"/>and testing of
                        logistic requirements based thereon; and the determination of allied wartime
                        requirements, so that the magnitude and composition of the probable demand
                        on U.S. resources can be identified.</p>

                        by those papers. In some cases the various documents say roughly the same
                        thing in different words, and choices have been made between such versions;
                        in no case does there appear to be an omission of important statements of
                        policy or a distortion through choice of one text over another.</p>
                    <p>2. Paragraph 45 of 162/2 has been included as a “basic problem” at the
                        beginning of the paper along with the two classic basic problems enshrined
                        in 162/2. We saw no objection to this; in fact it struck us as a good
                        idea.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> was not satisfied
                        with paragraph 7, which is a staff redraft of paragraph 13 of 162/2. He
                        apparently wished to see a clear policy statement as to what the U.S. should
                        do in case of attack on various specified countries. He also wished the
                        paragraph brought up-to-date in view of the extension of our commitments
                        through the Manila Treaty. I think we should resist any proposal to put down
                        on paper specifically where we would fight and where we would not in case of
                        attack. I have some recollection that it was in order to avoid doing this
                        that the paragraph in 162/2 was given the form it has and was included among
                        the general considerations, as stating a situation, rather than among the
                        policy conclusions. Moreover very great difficulties are involved in
                        attempting to make definitive lists of countries, indicating those instances
                        where we would ultimately engage in general war, probably would do so, would
                        only engage in limited war, etc., nor would it be possible to make sharp
                        distinctions between our obligations to fight under the various formulas
                        contained in our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Manila and other
                        treaty obligations. Would it not be best, on all counts, to retain the
                        paragraph more or less as it was in 162/2; with certain minor changes for
                        clarification which appear in the attached redraft?</p>
                    <p>4. In paragraph 10 the first sentence is taken from paragraph 39 (b) of
                        162/2. It was agreed that some addition will have to be made in order to
                        take account of the subsequent decision of the President. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LAYJSJ1">Lay</persName>’s suggested wording that the
                        President shall determine how nuclear weapons shall be used does not seem
                        adequate. The following is suggested: “The actual decision for such use will
                        be made at the time by the President (Presidential memorandum of January 4,
                        1954)”.</p>
                    <p>5. The last sentence of paragraph 39, taken from 5422/2,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d125fn3">Dated Aug. 7, <ref target="#pg_715">p.

                        assistance. This paragraph of the guidelines, so far as I know, was not
                        intended to supplant paragraph 36 (e) of 162/2, which states merely that
                        economic <pb xml:id="pg_738" n="738" facs="0768"/>aid should be based on the
                        best interests of the U.S. It would be a good idea to include this thought
                        in the composite paper.</p>
                    <p>6. You may wish to take up privately with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> the idea that a general Council
                        discussion of basic policy before the various agencies have submitted their
                        specific proposals would not be useful and that it would be better for the
                        Council merely to take note of the agreed statement of existing policy and
                        request the agencies to submit proposals for its revision.</p>

                    <p>4. The United States, prior to the achievement of mutual atomic plenty,
                        should create conditions under which the United States and the free world
                        coalition would be prepared to meet the Soviet-Communist threat with
                        resolution and to negotiate for its alleviation under proper safeguards,

                    <p>5. In the face of Soviet threats to U.S. security, the United States must
                        develop and maintain, at the lowest feasible cost, requisite military and
                        non-military strength to deter and, if necessary, to counter Soviet military
                        aggression against the United States or other areas vital to its security,
                        (para. 34, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The United States should minimize the risk of Soviet aggression by
                            maintaining a strong security posture, with emphasis on adequate
                            offensive retaliatory strength and defensive strength. This must be
                            based on massive atomic capability, including necessary bases; an
                            integrated and effective continental defense system; ready forces of the
                            United States and its allies suitably deployed and adequate to deter or
                            initially to counter aggression, and to discharge required initial tasks
                            in the event of a general war; and a mobilization base adequate to
                            insure victory in the event of general war; all supported by the
                            determined spirit of the U.S. people, (para. 34–a and 9, <gloss

                    <p>9. In specific situations where a warning appears desirable and feasible as
                        an added deterrent, the United States should make clear to the USSR and
                        Communist China, in general terms or with reference to specific areas as the
                        situation requires, its intention to react with military force against any
                        aggression by Soviet bloc armed forces, (para. 39–a, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>10. In the event of hostilities, the United States will consider nuclear
                        weapons to be as available for use as other munitions, (para. 39–b (1),
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2) This policy is subject to the
                        interpretation stated in a memorandum dated January 4, 1954. Planning should
                        be on the assumption that, if general war should occur, the United States
                        will wage it with all available weapons, (para. 9, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5422/2)</p>
                    <p>11. The United States should seek, as and when feasible, the understanding
                        and approval of this policy by free nations, (para. 39–b (1), <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2) Where the consent of an ally is
                        required for the use of these weapons from U.S. bases on the territory of
                        such ally, the United States should promptly obtain the advance consent of
                        such ally for such use. (para. 39–b (1), <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162/2)</p>
                    <p>12. The U.S. should, while exerting continued efforts to strengthen
                        collective defense arrangements, including the ability to use such bases for
                        nuclear attack in the collective defense of the free world, also increase
                        emphasis on developing self-sufficiency for the conduct of offensive
                        operations exploiting the use of nuclear weapons, consistent with sound
                        military concepts, (para. 10, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5422/2)</p>
                    <p>13. To permit appropriate flexibility in the capability of deterring or
                        defeating local aggressions, the U.S. should be prepared to defeat such
                        aggressions without necessarily initiating general war. For this purpose the
                        U.S. should be prepared to assist, with U.S. logistical support and if
                        necessary with mobile U.S. forces, indigenous forces supplemented by
                        available support from other nations acting under UN or regional
                        commitments. However, the U.S. must be determined to take, unilaterally if
                        necessary, whatever additional action its security requires, even to the
                        extent of general war, and the Communists must be convinced of this
                        determination, (para. 12, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/2)</p>
                    <p>14. The threat of piecemeal Communist conquest through subversion, indirect
                        aggression, and the instigation or exploitation of civil wars in free world
                        countries, which is an immediate and most serious threat to the free world,
                        should be met, not primarily by military means, but by a flexible
                        combination of political, psychological, economic and military actions. In
                        view of the loss of Northern Vietnam, the U.S. cannot passively accept
                        further significant extension of Communist control. It must act, both in
                        relation to the Communist powers and to the peoples of threatened areas, so
                        as to <pb xml:id="pg_745" n="745" facs="0775"/>prevent such extension of
                        control. In particular, the U.S. should: (para. 13, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        <item>a. Seek more than military solutions to the varied aspects of the
                            Soviet-Communist threat, and create an understanding in the free world
                            that such is the U.S. objective, (para. 13–a, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            the political and economic strength of underdeveloped areas, along lines
                            indicated in Section IV–C below, (para. 13–b, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        continue to be guided by paragraphs 34 and 40 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 162/2 in the light of paragraphs 9 and 10 of the “General
                        Considerations” thereof; recognizing that increased efforts in certain
                        programs, involving increased expenditures, should be made as required to
                        support national security policies and to meet anticipated increases in
                        Soviet-Communist capabilities, (para. 14, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5422/2)</p>

                        Institutions</p>
                    <p>6. a. In the interest of both the United States and its allies, the United
                        States should insure that the support of defense expenditures does not
                        seriously impair the basic soundness of the U.S. economy by undermining
                        incentives or by inflation, (para. 40, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        162/2)</p>
                    <p>b. The United States must, however, meet the necessary costs of the policies
                        essential for its security. The actual level of such costs should be kept to
                        the minimum consistent with the carrying out of these policies, (para. 40,
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>c. Barring basic change in the world situation, the Federal Government should
                        continue to make a determined effort to bring its total annual expenditures
                        into balance, or into substantial balance with its total annual revenues and
                        should maintain over-all credit <pb xml:id="pg_746" n="746" facs="0776"/>and
                        fiscal policies designed to assist in stabilizing the economy, (para. 40,
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>d. Every effort should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and
                        unnecessary overhead in the Federal Government, and to minimize Federal
                        expenditures for programs that are not essential to the national security,
                        (para. 40, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>e. The United States should seek to maintain a higher and expanding rate of
                        economic activity at relatively stable price levels, (para. 40, <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>f. The economic potential of private enterprise should be maximized by
                        minimizing governmental controls and regulations, and by encouraging private
                        enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g. nuclear
                        power), (para. 40, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>17. The American people must be informed of the nature of the
                        Soviet-Communist threat, in particular the danger inherent in the increasing
                        Soviet atomic capability; of the basic community of interest among the
                        nations of the free world; and of the need for mobilizing the spiritual and
                        material resources necessary to meet the Soviet threat, (para. 30, <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p>18. To support the necessarily heavy burdens for national security, the
                        morale of the citizens of the United States must be based both on
                        responsibility and freedom for the individual. The dangers from Soviet
                        subversion and espionage require strong and effective security measures.
                        Eternal vigilance, however, is needed in their exercise to prevent the
                        intimidation of free criticism. It is essential that necessary measures of
                        protection should not be so used as to destroy the national unity based on
                        freedom, not on fear. (para. 41, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Action to Reduce Soviet Power</p>
                    <p>19. The policy of the United States is to prevent Soviet aggression and
                        continuing domination of other nations, and to establish an effective
                        control of armaments under proper safeguards; but is not to dictate the

                    <p>20. Although the time for a significant rollback of Soviet power may appear
                        to be in the future, the U.S. should be prepared, by feasible current
                        actions or future planning, to take advantage of any earlier opportunity to
                        contract Communist-controlled areas and power, (para. 20, <gloss

                        influence in the free world, the United States should, in addition to the
                        measures mentioned in paragraph 14 above:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. Take overt and covert measures to discredit Soviet prestige and
                            ideology as effective instruments of Soviet power, and to reduce the
                            strength of communist parties and other pro-Soviet elements.</item>
                        <item>b. Undertake selective, positive actions to eliminate Soviet-Communist
                            control over any areas of the free world, (para. 43–a and c, <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>22. a. Measures to impose pressures on the Soviet bloc should take into
                        account the desirability of creating conditions which will induce the Soviet
                        leadership to be more receptive to acceptable negotiated settlements.</p>
                    <p>b. Accordingly, the United States should take feasible political, economic,
                        propaganda and covert measures designed to create and exploit troublesome
                        problems for the USSR, impair Soviet relations with Communist China,
                        complicate control in the satellites, and retard the growth of the military
                        and economic potential of the Soviet bloc. (para. 44, <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Negotiations</p>
                    <p>23. The United States must keep open the possibility of negotiating with the
                        USSR and Communist China acceptable and enforceable agreements, compatible
                        with basic U.S. security interests, whether limited to individual issues now
                        outstanding or involving a general settlement of major issues, including
                        control of armaments. Moreover, to maintain the continued support of its
                        allies, the United States must seek to convince them of its desire to reach
                        such settlements. But, in doing so, we must not allow the possibility of
                        such settlements to delay or reduce efforts to develop and maintain adequate
                        free world strength, and thus enable the Soviets to increase their relative
                        strength, (paras. 42–b and 14–a, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/
                        2)</p>
                    <p>24. Despite serious question whether any safe and enforceable system can be
                        achieved in the foreseeable future, the U.S. should nevertheless continue to
                        explore fully the possibility of reaching a practicable arrangement for the
                        limitation of armaments with the USSR. The U.S. should therefore continue to
                        reexamine its position on disarmament, especially (a) whether a promising
                        climate for effective disarmament negotiations can be developed, (b) whether
                        a system of safeguards can be devised entailing less risk for U.S. security
                        than no limitation of armaments, and (c) whether, if a safe and enforceable
                        system for assuring effective nuclear disarmament, which might be acceptable
                        to the USSR, can be devised, the U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_748" n="748"

                        conventional disarmament. Meanwhile, the United States should continue to
                        refuse to accept nuclear disarmament except as part of general disarmament,
                        (para. 8, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/2)</p>

                    <p>25. Major allies will continue to be essential to the U.S. to prevent the
                        loss of major free areas to Communist control and the gradual isolation of
                        the U.S. However, increasing elements of division and weakness in free world
                        alliances may make it difficult to take decisive collective action to halt
                        further Soviet expansion, particularly in Asia. (para. 15, <gloss

                    <p>26. In these circumstances, the U.S. should take action as practicable:</p>

                        <item>a. (1) To overcome the following divisive factors: increasing fear of
                            the effects of nuclear weapons, differing estimates of the nature and
                            imminence of the Communist threat, distrust of U.S. national purposes
                            and leadership, political instability and economic weakness of some of
                            our allies, conflicts regarding trade policy and economic integration,
                            historic hostility between certain of the allies, and differing

                            allies will be able to meet the threat of aggression even in case of
                            nuclear balance; and (2) that U.S. strategy, including the use of atomic
                            weapons, is conceived and will be implemented for the purpose of mutual
                            security and defense against the Soviet threat, (para. 16–b, <gloss

                    <p>27. Our diplomacy must concentrate upon clarifying to our allies in parts of
                        the world not gripped by war conditions that the best defense of the free
                        world rests upon a deployment of U.S. forces which permits initiative,
                        flexibility and support; upon our political <pb xml:id="pg_749" n="749"

                        aggressor who attacks such allies; and upon such allies, own indigenous
                        security efforts, (para. 38–c, 162/2) Under present policies, however, no
                        major withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe is contemplated, (para. 38–b,
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 and para. 8 of <gloss

                    <p>28. The U.S. should attempt to gain maximum support from the free world, both
                        allies and uncommitted countries, for the collective measures necessary to
                        prevent Communist expansion. As a broad rule of conduct, the U.S. should
                        pursue its objectives in such ways and by such means, including appropriate
                        pressures, persuasion, and compromise, as will maintain the cohesion of the
                        alliances. The U.S. should, however, act independently of its major allies
                        when the advantage of achieving U.S. objectives by such action clearly
                        outweighs the danger of lasting damage to its alliances. In this connection,
                        consideration should be given to the likelihood that the initiation of
                        action by the U.S. prior to allied acceptance may bring about subsequent
                        allied support. Allied reluctance to act should not inhibit the U.S. from
                        taking action, including the use of nuclear weapons, to prevent Communist
                        territorial gains when such action is clearly necessary to U.S. security,

                            aggression, and to counter the influences exercised by the Communist

                    </p>
                    <p>a. Present and future Soviet bloc capabilities for expansion by action short
                        of general war appear, in the light of developments in Indochina and at
                        Geneva, greater than a year ago. Throughout most of the free world,
                        especially in Asia, the Communists have the capability through hardcore
                        activists to engage in a wide variety of forms of penetration and
                        subversion, ranging from organized civil war (as in Indochina) through
                        persistent guerrilla activities (as in Malaya) to inflammatory
                        demonstrations, propaganda, “popular fronts”, and parliamentary harassment.
                        The Communists will therefore increase their emphasis on a “creeping
                        expansion” in preference to overt aggression, and they will continue to take
                        over spontaneous movements bred of nationalistic fervor or economic
                        discontent and to exploit free world disunity.</p>
                    <p>b. In the period through 1959, the Soviet rulers will almost certainly
                        believe that, as Soviet nuclear capabilities increase, the aversion of the
                        U.S. and, more especially, of its allies to general war will correspondingly
                        increase, and that the Kremlin will therefore have greater freedom to take
                        certain actions, including local military actions, without running
                        substantial risk of general war [in situations where the allies would be
                        likely to act as a brake on the United States.] <note n="‡‡"
                            xml:id="d126fn-sym8">Proposed by State. [Footnote and brackets in the
                            source text.]</note> The Kremlin may employ the threat of nuclear
                        devastation as an instrument of political warfare. The Kremlin will,
                        however, continue to be extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in
                        which the USSR would be subjected to nuclear attack. At the same time, the
                        Kremlin would probably not be deterred by the risk of general war from
                        taking counteraction against an action by the U.S. or its allies which the
                        Kremlin considered an imminent threat to Soviet security. The extent to
                        which the Kremlin uses the increased freedom of action which its increased
                        nuclear capabilities appear to give it, and the success which it achieves,
                        will depend primarily on the cohesion of the non-Communist world, and the
                        determination and strength of the major free world powers.</p>

                    <p>a. The U.S. will achieve atomic plenty during the early part of this period
                        and prior to like achievement by the Soviets. The U.S. is expected to
                        maintain relative numerical and qualitative superiority in nuclear weapons
                        and the means for their delivery. As the <pb xml:id="pg_758" n="758"
                            facs="0788"/>Soviets approach the absolute atomic capability of
                        inflicting critical damage upon U.S. and other allied targets, however,
                        there could result a condition of mutual deterrence to general war.</p>
                    <p>b. Free world forces will be confronted with quantitative superiority in
                        ground and tactical air forces in the geographical areas contiguous to the
                        Soviet Bloc. However, the superior tactical atomic support which can be
                        provided our allies during this period will, if accepted by them, partially
                        offset allied deficiencies in conventional forces. Taken as a whole,
                        effectiveness of European forces is considered fair to good. There has been
                        no progress in forming West German forces and limited progress in forming
                        Japanese forces. Events in the Far East resulted in a suspension of planned
                        redeployments from that area. D-day <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        commitments of U.S. forces in Europe remain unchanged. No progress has been
                        made in forming a strategic reserve based generally on U.S. territory, with
                        a high degree of combat readiness and a capability of being moved to any
                        threatened area.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Alliances</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. There have been serious instances of an unwillingness of important free
                        world nations to take concerted action which the U.S. considers necessary to
                        oppose communist expansion, particularly as regards Indochina, East-West
                        trade, and <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. West Germany is becoming
                        restive because of protracted delay in recovering its sovereignty. The
                        long-term alignment of Japan with the free world has become less certain.
                        The situation with respect to Indochina has deteriorated with unexpected
                        rapidity, confronting the free world with the possible loss of Southeast

                    <p>The underdeveloped areas of the free world will be especially vulnerable to
                        Communist penetration and subversion by reason of nationalism and
                        anti-colonialism, deep-seated distrust of the West, retarded economic
                        growth, military weakness, political ferment. Strong pressures will result
                        from impatience to achieve political and economic aspirations. Failure of
                        the local governments to provide some satisfaction of these aspirations will
                        create additional trouble and disunity in the free world while benefiting
                        the Soviet bloc and will increase the dangers of Communist take-over of
                        independent countries without armed aggression from outside. This danger
                        will be most acute in Asia, in dependent areas such as French North Africa
                        which are still under European rule, and in parts of Latin America.</p>

                            and therefore they cannot be viewed separately. The funds necessary to
                            implement the mobilization program should not be in lieu of but in
                            addition to those funds necessary to support and maintain the forces in

                            is stronger now than ever before in peacetime. Facilities actively

                            number through Fiscal Year 1957. Although, through Fiscal Year 1957
                            there will be further accretions to our reserve of completed military
                            end items, budgetary limitations and the criteria for accumulating
                            mobilization reserve stocks necessarily result in imbalance and deficits

                            obsolescence of reserve stocks is an element for consideration. Since
                            the other factor, reserve production facilities essential for
                            mobilization preparedness for general war, also will be inadequate, the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council
                        thoroughly on the long and involved background of the present paper, and
                        noted that he had received the views of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        only last evening. He read Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>’s memorandum, which pointed out the difficulty of the
                        problem and called for further study. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had
                        undertaken to rewrite the Planning Board’s draft, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said he was obliged to admit
                        that, with respect to format and presentation, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> draft was an improvement on that of the Planning Board.
                        With this view Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        expressed concurrence. In any case, continued Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, the views of the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff must have caused some pain to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, in view of the fact that in at
                        least three significant instances their views were closer to those of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> than they were to those of the
                        Secretary of Defense.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s

                        attention was invited to subparagraph 34–a of the Planning Board draft,<note

                                732</ref>.</note> which called for acceleration of measures for
                        dispersal to safer areas of important production capacity or, where that was
                        infeasible, for provision of alternative production sources in safer areas.
                        The President inquired as to the meaning of this statement. Did it imply
                        physically moving defense plants from dangerous areas to safer areas, or did
                        it simply mean increased tax amortization to business men who will undertake
                        in the future to build defense plants in safe areas? Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> replied that the latter was
                        the primary purport of this subparagraph.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_764" n="764" facs="0794"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that we had
                        “got the cart before the horse” on the entire problem of mobilization
                        guidelines. A great deal more work needed to be done, especially within the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff organization, before a reasonable policy could emerge.
                        Moreover, in truth, there was disagreement among the Chiefs of Staff
                        themselves. Finally, the present paper was based on incorrect military
                        assumptions.</p>
                    <p>The President reacted with some surprise to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s criticism of the report, and
                        observed that after all of our bitter experience in two world wars, he had
                        supposed that we could have reached agreement on the basic structure of our
                        mobilization policy. But here was Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> proposing that we go back and restudy all of these
                        fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said he wished to
                        go back to the President’s initial question, and observed that up to the
                        present time the Government had made use of tax amortization as an
                        inducement to new builders who would erect their plants in conformity with
                        the Government’s dispersal standards. From now on out, however, we wish to
                        extend this inducement to manufacturers whose plants are now producing in
                        danger areas and who wish to move to safer areas. Can we provide rapid tax
                        amortization privileges to such individuals?</p>
                    <p>The President said this seemed sound to him, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> interposed that he didn’t
                        believe it was as simple as that. Much depended on what the United States
                        could afford to do, since we must strike a balance between what we would
                        like to do and the money we had available.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested to the
                        President and the Council that they direct their attention to the
                        substantive changes proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="5"

                        part of subparagraph 34–a and the total deletion of subparagraph 34–b. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> stated that he
                        would gladly agree with the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on both these
                        subparagraphs, since the course of action called for therein anticipated the
                        completion of the studies called for in subparagraph 34–e. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> added that all the major
                        issues involved in our mobilization policy could be squarely met if the
                        Council concentrated on the guidance suggested in paragraph 34 as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                        his very great anxiety over the loss of revenue to the Treasury from
                        extensive tax amortizations. Was Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> proposing, for example, to abandon all the existing
                        defense plants in Detroit and rebuild them somewhere in <pb xml:id="pg_765"
                            n="765" facs="0795"/>West Virginia, with half the costs of such
                        rebuilding to be borne by the Government? Could we actually afford to do
                        anything on this scale?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> replied that he
                        welcomed having the issue stated so clearly by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. He said that he was not
                        campaigning to get people out of Detroit, but if the National Security
                        Council really meant business about dispersing critical defense plants, and
                        if the Government took seriously the threat posed to our production base by
                        estimated Soviet capabilities, then the Government certainly ought to be
                        willing to provide an incentive which would induce Detroit manufacturers to
                        move to safer areas.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that if
                        you went down the list and selected industrial plants which were producing
                        military items which were truly in short supply, and then if you could get
                        somebody to build a new plant in a dispersed area, he believed it was then
                        OK for the Government to pay half the cost for the erection of a new plant.
                        On the other hand, it was the height of folly to tell every manufacturer of
                        defense materials who wants to move his plant that the Government would pay
                        half the costs. We simply couldn’t afford anything like this, and that was
                        what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> was
                        proposing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> replied that it
                        seemed at least better to him for private investment to build these new
                        defense plants rather than to resort to the only other alternative, which
                        was to have the Government build the plants. He repeated that the whole
                        issue boiled down to the question of how seriously the Government was taking
                        its dispersal program for critical defense production facilities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        the truth of the matter was that a whole lot of business men were trying to
                        get their plants built with the Government paying half the cost.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> again insisted
                        that the Council should start all over again on its study of mobilization
                        policy, in view of such factors as lack of agreement on requirements,
                        timing, and what might actually happen in a third world war. Not least of
                        all the shortcomings of the present report was the fact that it had nothing
                        to say about civilian requirements, although this was a limitation on
                        production that must certainly be taken into account in formulating an
                        adequate mobilization policy. Also, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, it was a serious mistake to
                        talk about this mobilization problem only in terms and in measurements of
                        money. This was wrong, for one thing, because the cost of many military end
                        items, such as tanks, is steadily coming down. Timing also was a great
                        factor. During the Korean war we had produced large numbers of tanks and
                        planes that simply weren’t any good. Now, however, production of these items
                        was in pretty good shape, and you could actually duplicate <pb
                            xml:id="pg_766" n="766" facs="0796"/>your production of them if you
                        really knew what your requirements were and what you needed to make to be
                        ready for a future war.</p>
                    <p>The President again expressed surprise at Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s argument. He pointed out that
                        recently, at his request, the Department of Defense had furnished him, for
                        use in a speech, our exact requirements for 1100 major military end items.
                        If we keep recomputing these requirements year after year, the President
                        said, how will we ever get anywhere near our mobilization goals?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said he agreed
                        heartily with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s
                        contention that we needed to bring our mobilization requirements up to date
                        on a continuing basis. Defense and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> have
                        already agreed on a procedure for doing just this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that we
                        were really very confused on whether or not we ought to keep production
                        lines in being when there was no call for their products. As he saw it, he
                        said, we were spending our money in this field for six main categories: (1)
                        for maintenance of the existing level of forces; (2) modernization plans;
                        (3) research and development; (4) stockpiling end items; (5) increase of
                        capacity, including dispersion; and (6) improvement of bases and housing.
                        More and more of us, he said, are coming to think that the first six months
                        of a third world war would be the crucial phase. All this has a great
                        bearing on the issue now before the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> whether it was not true that all six of the points
                        that he had raised had long since been decided on. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> replied that the decisions on
                        them had been reached in 1951, and that the President would not be very
                        happy now with the decisions which had been made at that time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that the point of
                        the matter, and what really worried him most, were the facts and statistics
                        set forth in the Planning Board’s paragraph 30.<note n="6" xml:id="d128fn6"

                        billion. The difference, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>, was quite alarming.</p>

                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> commented that
                        in his opinion the National Security Council was talking about the present

                        problems bearing on mobilization policy will have been solved, and the
                        Council will also have the advantage of having received the report on the
                        net capabilities of the Soviet Union to damage the United States.<note n="7"

                                >NIE</gloss>–11–4–54, “Soviet Capabilities and Probable Courses of
                            Action Through Mid-1959”, dated Sept. 14, 1954, scheduled for
                            publication in <ref target="frus1952-54v08">volume VIII</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether it would not be possible to get this whole
                        problem portrayed on a chart or charts which would show the situation
                        mobilization-wise that we would be in on M-day and thereafter—what we will
                        look like. The chart should also include the strategic concept on the basis
                        of which “we are going to fight.”</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> confessed that
                        there was disagreement within the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the strategic
                        aspects of war planning. He also expressed agreement with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> that money figures
                        were often misleading in calculating mobilization requirements. For example,
                        even if you had a great deal more money you couldn’t procure a great many
                        more aircraft, for the simple reason that aircraft could not be stockpiled
                        in any great number. By and large, said Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, our armed forces were
                        better off than ever before in peacetime history, and we had a better
                        mobilization and better production base than we had ever had in
                        peacetime.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                        >Radford</persName>’s suggestion that the Council was premature in its
                        consideration of the mobilization guidelines report, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council that it had
                        embarked on this present exercise in March 1954 in order to have reached
                        decisions which would be helpful in providing guidance for the formulation
                        of the budget for the next Fiscal Year. Now here we are, on October 25; our
                        task is still unfinished after six months, and there is not even a meeting
                        of minds on how to complete it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> reiterated his
                        conviction that appropriate budget guidance was actually provided by
                        paragraph 34 of the Planning Board’s draft. Turning to subparagraph 34–a, he
                        said he would like to underline the word “important” in the phrase
                        “accelerate measures for dispersal to safer areas of important production
                        capacity . . .”. He said if this directive were applied to a small number of
                        critical end items, this would form the basis of a very practical program of
                        dispersal. The President, however, remained skeptical, and asked Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> how his proposal
                        met the previously expressed objections of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. How, in other words, <pb
                            xml:id="pg_768" n="768" facs="0798"/>asked the President, can we meet
                        this and avoid being blackjacked by some company which wished the Government
                        to pay half the expenses of its new construction? Was one solution,
                        continued the President, the possibility of offering tax amortization on a
                        competitive basis? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> replied that this would certainly be complicated. The
                        President replied that of course it would be complicated, but that it might
                        be an answer to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>’s legitimate fears.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then raised the
                        question as to who should have jurisdiction over this problem, particularly
                        as between himself and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> replied that obviously this was a joint
                        responsibility of Defense and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> went on to say that
                        what really worried him most in the mobilization picture was the aircraft
                        industry. It was a very easy target for enemy action and it was an industry
                        which was difficult to move. If we could find a practical answer as to what
                        to do with this industry we would really have accomplished something useful.
                        Similarly, the “missile business” is also a looming problem. For this reason
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said he
                        believed it was better to try to approach this whole problem by pieces, item
                        by item, rather than first trying to look at it as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he was
                        quite agreeable to approaching the problem piece by piece. He said he also
                        agreed with the President’s approach to subparagraph 34–a in terms of a
                        competitive tax amortization offer. He concluded that he was willing to
                        accept the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version of subparagraph 34–a
                        and to agree with the Joint Chiefs to drop subparagraph 34–b entirely.</p>
                    <p>The President reverted to his earlier idea that the best way to get all of
                        this more clearly before the minds of the Council members was to present it
                        visually instead of wholly in a written report. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed, and called also for
                        confining the illustrations to a small number of specific items, such as
                        aircraft. The President went on to say that what he wanted was a picture of
                        the problem that we were trying to solve, and he felt that such a picture
                        could readily be presented by an effective and imaginative staff
                        officer.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> went through the
                        remainder of paragraph 34 and pointed out that the Net Capabilities
                        Evaluation Subcommittee’s report would be very helpful in carrying out
                        subparagraph c. With respect to subparagraph d, he felt this to be a
                        statement of principle which is altogether valid, even if certain safeguards
                        were needed. As to subparagraph e, he said he did not see how he could
                        possibly avoid making the kind of studies called for in this
                        subparagraph.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_769" n="769" facs="0799"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> took issue
                        with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> on
                        subparagraph 34–d, and said he strongly preferred a program of converting
                        existing plants making peacetime materials to quite different production of
                        war materials, as opposed to the creation of large numbers of stand-by
                        plants. Nothing, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, grows obsolete so rapidly as stand-by plants.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then summarized the
                        discussion and suggested an action for adoption by the Council which was in
                        effect to adopt the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version tentatively
                        and subject to reexamination at a meeting of the Council on December 3.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> and the
                        President agreed with this proposed action. Mr. <persName>Hughes</persName>,
                        however, pointed out that one sentence in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> paragraph 28 disturbed him. This read: “The funds necessary
                        to implement the mobilization program should not be in lieu of but in
                        addition to those funds necessary to support and maintain the forces in
                        being.” Written as it was, without any qualification, it seemed a dangerous
                        invitation to spend money. The President said that of course we did not want
                        to throw money around and permanently damage our economy. On the other hand,
                        we had to be willing to spend enough to save our lives, and he still stood
                        strongly by the concept of doing what we needed to do “over the long haul”.
                        It was therefore agreeable to him to amend this sentence by the addition of
                        the phrase “Subject to decisions on the budget,” at the beginning of the
                        last sentence of paragraph 28.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. The broad concepts upon which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 is
                        based remain valid.</p>
                    <p>2. Changes in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 are required because
                        of the following significant developments which have occurred during the
                        past year.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The USSR has greatly modified its tactics and techniques for
                            achieving its objectives in the political, psychological and economic
                            fields. In addition, revised intelligence estimates give the USSR and
                            the Soviet bloc significantly increased capabilities in the nuclear and
                            military fields.</item>
                        <item>b. Significant breakthroughs in U.S. national policy have been made in
                            the Middle East and possibly in Germany. In the Far East there have been
                            fewer successes in the achievement of U.S. objectives and in Southeast
                            Asia there has been an important Chinese-Soviet bloc expansion of
                            power.</item>
                        <item>c. Developments by the U.S. in the thermo-nuclear field have been
                            extremely significant.</item>
                        <item>d. Basic national differences between the U.S. and our allies in both
                            the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, which have been submerged in the
                            face of the serious Soviet threat, are becoming more evident.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>3. The general objectives of the new document should include achievement of a
                        just peace within which the vital security interests of the U.S. are
                        preserved.</p>
                    <p>4. A continuing strong military posture and a determination not only to
                        assume our share of world leadership, but to use force if <pb
                            xml:id="pg_771" n="771" facs="0801"/>necessary to safeguard vital U.S.
                        interests, remain basic. The U.S. is in the process of regrouping its
                        military forces to carry out the concepts set forth in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2. The U.S. has found that maintenance
                        of modern armed forces by underdeveloped countries requires very substantial
                        economic support. To counter the type of threat encountered in Vietnam, an
                        elite constabulary and small, mobile, well trained military forces are the
                        minimum essential requirement. World-wide U.S. commitments must be reviewed
                        and revised to meet the current and projected situation.</p>
                    <p>5. There is a need for a clearly stated concept outlining the relationship
                        between U.S. and Allied military forces, particularly in the underdeveloped
                        areas and a policy statement as to the desirable degree of integration of
                        these forces in the event of both local operations and in the event of a
                        general war. This would lead to a later review of force goals of U.S.
                        allies, particularly in the underdeveloped areas, and the establishment of
                        U.S. force levels which will give minimum security to peripheral areas
                        during the possible local wars, without jeopardizing U.S. war plans dealing
                        with general war.</p>
                    <p>6. Overall U.S. policy towards Europe needs to be reviewed. An assessment as
                        to the situation after Germany begins to make her full contribution to
                        Western defense is essential with evaluation of the role of modern weapons
                        in allied hands.</p>
                    <p>7. Our China policy, including East-West Controls of China trade, should be
                        reviewed and revised. New efforts must be made to regain the initiative in
                        Asia and the Near East.</p>
                    <p>8. Our success in the Near East should be exploited by following through to
                        establish greater cohesion and increased strength of the area.</p>
                    <p>9. General policies on Africa should at least receive mention in the new
                        document.</p>
                    <p>10. Generally, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should reexamine the
                        relative emphasis which should be assigned to military and economic programs
                        in the underdeveloped countries of the Free World. In these areas, technical
                        assistance, economic and educational programs and training and internal
                        police forces should be strengthened to bring* about better and more stable
                        governments, sounder economic principles and practices and generally
                        strengthen free world ties among these people as insurance against tactics
                        of “creeping expansion—internal subversion” employed successfully by the
                        enemy in many such areas. As a general objective the U.S. should act
                        sympathetically and in a humanitarian manner towards the people and emerging
                        nations of the underdeveloped areas in their struggle for independence and
                        higher standards of living.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_772" n="772" facs="0802"/>
                    <p>11. The U.S. should take stock of its ability to meet the more flexible and
                        less predictable Soviet tactics, particularly in the political, internal
                        police, economic and psychological fields, and make the necessary changes in
                        organization and short-range policy to meet the new situation.</p>
                    <p>12. There must be made available adequate resources to execute national
                        security policies and to maintain the U.S. military posture.</p>

                    <p>Reappraisal of national security policy must take account of recent changes
                        and probable trends, both in the policies and tactics of the Communist
                        powers and in the free world situation.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Communist Policies</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Soviet shift to a “soft” line since the death of <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> is a major new factor. It tends
                        to allay the fears of free-world countries, to relax their efforts to build
                        effective defenses, to foster neutralism, and to divide the free peoples.
                        The ending of hostilities in Korea and Indochina reinforces these
                        trends.</p>
                    <p>The evidence so far does not prove that the USSR has modified its basic
                        hostility toward the U.S. and the free world. As of now, however, the USSR
                        appears anxious to avoid general war with the U.S. and probably will refrain
                        from actions likely to bring on such a war, and may be seeking an extended
                        period of lower tensions.</p>
                    <p>Communist China remains bitterly hostile to the U.S. and ostensibly committed
                        to the conquest of Formosa. Despite its bellicose talk, however, Communist
                        China may well be more interested in strengthening its economy and its
                        international position than in early major military ventures that would
                        involve war with the U.S. Its main effort in expanding its power probably
                        will take the form of penetration and subversion in neighboring
                        countries.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_773" n="773" facs="0803"/>
                    <p>The Sino-Soviet tie probably will remain intact for the next few years
                        because it furthers the purposes of both parties. The USSR, however, may
                        exercise a restraining influence on Communist China.</p>

                        through a general war, even if a military victory were won. A situation of
                        mutual deterrence to general war could result. However, the possibility of

                    <p>Existing basic national security policy remains generally valid.
                        Clarification and changes in emphasis, however, seem required in the

                    <p>A prolonged period of cold war, with a reduced fear of overt aggression, will

                    </p>
                    <p>a. The primary aim must be to deter any Communist armed aggression and to
                        avoid the danger that such aggression would develop into general nuclear
                        war. For this purpose the U.S., with its allies, should maintain sufficient
                        flexible military capabilities, and firmness of policy, to convince the
                        Communist rulers that the U.S. and its allies have the means to ensure that
                        aggression will not pay and the will to use military force if the situation
                        requires.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_775" n="775" facs="0805"/>
                    <p>b. The U.S., however, should (1) forego actions which would generally be
                        regarded as provocative, and (2) be prepared, if hostilities occur, to meet
                        them, where feasible, in a manner and on a scale which will not inevitably
                        broaden them into total nuclear war. In the conditions facing us, such
                        policies are necessary to assure the support of our allies against
                        aggression and to avoid risks which do not promise commensurate strategic or
                        political gains. These conclusions have an obvious bearing on basic military
                        strategy and on our policy toward Communist China.</p>
                    <p>c. In organizing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense around nuclear

                    <list>
                        <item>(1) The U.S. should recognize that it will be morally committed to
                            maintain in Europe forces for using these weapons or to supply such

                            countries.</item>
                        <item>(2) The U.S. and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should explore

                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces to avoid exclusive dependence
                            on atomic weapons, without losing their deterrent effect, so as to give
                            the Europeans some sense of choice as to the actual character of
                            warfare. Otherwise the strategy will strain the will to fight and spur
                            neutralism.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>d. Guided missiles seem certain to become available within several years and
                        to effect even more radically the problem of defense. It is not too soon to
                        begin studies of their effects on our military strategy and alliances. At
                        least in the early stages, when ranges are limited, they are likely to
                        enhance greatly the importance of our overseas bases and our alliances.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Without relaxing its defense posture, the U.S. should be

                        Vis–à–Vis the Soviet Bloc</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relative Soviet Military Power</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Bloc’s power to launch military action against the US will be
                        substantially greater five years hence when it will probably have completed
                        the re-equipment of its long-range air force with high-performance jet
                        aircraft and have accumulated a substantial arsenal of assorted tactical and
                        strategic nuclear weapons (including multi-megaton bombs). At the same time
                        its air defenses will be substantially improved, and its conventional
                        armaments, particularly submarines and the ground forces of itself and
                        China, will be thoroughly modernized.</p>
                    <p>2. Against these developments we must balance the continued improvement of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces plus the probable
                        introduction of important German units, the possibility of some rearmament
                        in Japan, and the progressive development of new defensive weapons and
                        measures. On balance, it is believed that the USSR will have a net
                        capability to inflict increasingly serious injury on the US from 1957 on.
                        And if, as we estimate, the Soviets can develop an intercontinental
                        ballistic missile by early in the 1960’s, it will confront the US with a
                        further physical insecurity, for which there may be no practical
                        countermeasure.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_777" n="777" facs="0807"/>
                    <p>3. The USSR already possesses the net capability to inflict crippling damage
                        on this country’s principal industrial allies, specifically the major
                        nations of Western Europe and Japan. No improvement in defensive measures
                        presently contemplated will be sufficient to prevent this net capability
                        from becoming greater with the passage of time, especially as Soviet
                        capabilities in medium-range missiles improve. This growing vulnerability of
                        our Allies has already visibly reduced their willingness to incur any
                        appreciable risk of war in order to prevent Soviet successes in third areas,
                        notably in Asia. We must expect that our Allies will show increasing
                        reluctance to engage in diplomatic or military action which seems to involve
                        a risk of war. With certain exceptions where their own vital interests are
                        directly concerned, their willingness to stand firm will decline in the face
                        of new acts of subversion, minor communist advances, and acts of Soviet
                        intimidation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political and Economic Situation of the Bloc</p>
                    <p>4. Based on present trends, political and economic developments within the
                        Bloc may be expected to continue favorable from the Soviet standpoint.
                        Despite discontent in the European Satellites, there is little chance of
                        Soviet control being shaken by internal revolt in the next few years, though
                        there is the possibility that unrest and economic difficulties might tend
                        increasingly to reduce their net contribution to the strength of the Bloc.
                        Within the USSR itself the succession crisis has to date been surmounted
                        with surprising ease, and there is evidence that the Soviet people are less
                        dissatisfied with the regime than in years past.</p>
                    <p>5. For the next few years, the economic growth of the USSR can be expected to
                        continue at a rate (expressed in percentage terms) almost double that of the
                        US. The total output of the US economy will, of course, continue to greatly
                        exceed that of the USSR, and the growth of output in absolute terms should
                        be greater in the US in most years. These comparisons in terms of total
                        output are, however, misleading from the military viewpoint, because Soviet
                        efforts have been concentrated on heavy industry and on the production of
                        capital goods and military end items, with the consequence that a far larger
                        proportion of the USSR’s smaller total output is of a sort that contributes
                        to the nation’s war potential. There is currently some increased emphasis on
                        consumer goods and on agriculture, which is still a weak point. Nonetheless,
                        the Soviet margin of advantage in growth rates will be greater in the
                        industrial sector than in the economy as a whole, and the Soviets will
                        certainly devote to capital investment a far higher proportion of their
                        output than the US.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_778" n="778" facs="0808"/>
                    <p>6. Except for specialized items of direct military importance, Free World
                        restrictions in trade with the USSR are likely to produce only minor
                        nuisance effect and to be less and less effective in view of increasing Bloc
                        self-sufficiency. There will be growing opposition to the maintenance of
                        controls on trade with the Bloc in both Free Europe and Asia (especially
                        Japan).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist China</p>
                    <p>7. Red China has emerged as a powerful junior partner in the Bloc—a nation
                        more vigorous and cohesive than at any time since the 17th century. At the
                        present time the Red China regime is definitely oriented toward the USSR not
                        only for ideological reasons but because it has nowhere else to turn for
                        help in attaining its industrial and strategic goals. It seems unlikely that
                        the US will continue to find a majority with it for opposing the entrance of
                        Communist China into the United Nations. Moreover, most other Asians
                        (including the Japanese) and most Europeans will continue to be highly
                        sensitive to actions by the US which seem to be designed to render peacful
                        coexistence with Red China impossible. We may therefore face a further
                        degree of isolation on the UN and other issues related to Communist China,
                        as time goes on, which would adversely affect our relations with other
                        friendly countries and neutrals, and hence the carrying out of our policy in
                        the Far East.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Lines of Soviet Policy</p>
                    <p>8. While we continue to estimate that the Soviet leaders ultimately envisage
                        “(a) the elimination of every world power center capable of competing with
                        the USSR, (b) the spread of Communism to all parts of the world, and (c)
                        Soviet domination of the other Communist regimes,” we have increasing
                        evidence that the top Soviet leadership realize that this is a long-term
                        objective and may be genuinely desirous of a considerable period of
                        “coexistence”, that is, a period of some years in which tensions and risks
                        of war are reduced. Recent statements by <persName corresp="#p_MALENKOVGM1"
                            >Malenkov</persName> added to concrete steps with respect to Yugoslavia
                        and other neighbors, and unrest in certain of the satellites, suggest that
                        the USSR would like to “make a deal” (or series of deals) that would secure
                        Western acquiescence to the approximate present area of their domination, in
                        exchange for their undertaking not to expand the Communist orbit by force.
                        Such a Soviet desire would be motivated in part by fear of war, in part by
                        the already clear belief that a return to the <persName corresp="#p_STALIN1"
                            >Stalin</persName>ist level of tensions would be counterproductive and
                        that the Western alliance can be better split by soft than by hard tactics,
                        and in part by domestic preoccupations in both the USSR and Communist China.
                        Whether the Soviets might again turn to a tough policy, <pb xml:id="pg_779"
                            n="779" facs="0809"/>and the lengths to which they would then go, would
                        depend largely on the firmness and stability of the Free World in a
                        developing situation of effective atomic plenty.</p>
                    <p>9. Though we assume that the Western coalition is resolved to proceed with
                        the ratification of the Paris agreements<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">For
                            documentation on the “Paris agreements”, see <ref
                                target="frus1952-54v05p2">vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1294 ff.</note>
                        despite any Soviet diplomatic maneuvers, there is throughout Europe an
                        impatience to explore the possibilities of “coexistence” that will be
                        increasingly difficult to resist once the agreements are accomplished. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, French, and German governments will
                        press strongly for efforts to reach a general settlement with the Soviets.
                        The US may be able to restrain this urge for a while. However, if the Soviet
                        “peace offensive” continues, sometime in 1955 the US will probably have to
                        choose between increasing isolation from its major Allies and participation
                        in such a move, with a review [view] to debunking the Soviet “peace
                        offensive” to the degree it turns out to be phony.</p>
                    <p>10. On the other hand there are some indications that the Soviet “peace
                        offensive” might taper off, as at least some of the leaders of the USSR
                        apparently advocate a decidedly tough reaction to the ratification of the
                        German rearmament agreements. Thus during the months ahead the US might well
                        prepare alternative policies depending on whether or not the Soviet “peace
                        offensive” continues after the Paris pacts are ratified.</p>
                    <p>11. We estimate that the USSR will not deliberately initiate, and will try to
                        restrain its Far Eastern allies and satellites from deliberately initiating,
                        a hot war or overt military aggression within the next five years provided
                        the US and the Free World maintain an adequate military posture. On the
                        other hand, even if Soviet leaders genuinely desire the period of relaxation
                        mentioned above, such a period would take some time to develop.
                        Notwithstanding the pendency, or even the actual existence, of a “deal” or
                        “deals” covering overt aggressive action, the Soviet leaders will not expect
                        subversive movements to diminish, nor will they plan in fact to abandon
                        their initiation, direction and covert support of such movements. Thus, the
                        Soviet Bloc will not hesitate to seize opportunities to exploit weaknesses
                        and division in the rest of the world, with all of the techniques of
                        political, psychological, economic and subversive warfare at which they are
                        adept, and will devote major financial and other resources to this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>12. As the lines between the Soviet Bloc and Western coalition have come to
                        be more and more clearly drawn over the last seven years, a situation has
                        come into being in which any further Soviet Bloc gains of territory (whether
                        through aggression from without <pb xml:id="pg_780" n="780" facs="0810"/>or
                        subversion from within) would have an impact which might be out of all
                        proportion to the strategic, economic, or political significance of the
                        territory lost. The US is challenged by an aggressive enemy with the
                        capability of organizing opposition in virtually all parts of the world, and
                        this enemy’s strategy of reliance upon excessive promises and of exploiting
                        every disruptive local issue places it in a position to exploit as a victory
                        almost every breakdown that occurs in the machinery of society outside of
                        the Soviet Bloc. Unlike Britain in the 19th century, therefore, the US today
                        must take seriously, as a potential threat to the cohesion and determination
                        of the Free World, every situation of weakness that develops anywhere in the
                        non-communist world from Chile to Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Recommendation</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Need for Additional Counter-Subversive Activity</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviets enjoy a substantial advantage in the field of integrated
                        subversive warfare. They have effective assets in most free countries in the
                        form of communist political parties, front organizations and underground
                        nets, as well as the tightly coordinated mechanisms of a dictatorial
                        government to control and direct the use of these assets. We should face the
                        fact that some of these advantages will persist. These are largely inherent
                        in the nature of the Soviet system, which has no scrutiny from a free press
                        and is not subject to the pressures generated by democratic political and
                        legal processes. The communists enjoy, too, the immense advantage of being
                        bent upon destruction and disruption everywhere outside their own border
                        with no responsibility for the infinitely more difficult task of
                        construction and conservation.</p>
                    <p>2. Despite the difficulties that confront the US Government by reason of its
                        devotion to freedom and democracy at home and to constructive purposes
                        abroad, there are shortcomings in our counter-subversive effort which could
                        be overcome. It goes without saying that the US will need to employ in a
                        closely coordinated fashion all the cold war weapons at its disposal,
                        including specifically economic measures, military programs designed to
                        achieve cold war objectives (rather than to contribute significantly to
                        allied strength in the event of a hot war), and covert operations. Yet this
                        Government has not developed the coordination, flexibility, and decisiveness
                        in resolving internal differences that would make possible the utilization
                        with maximum effect of all the assets which the US does possess. Furthermore
                        the US gets precious little help from its Allies in this field.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_781" n="781" facs="0811"/>
                    <p>3. These shortcomings will not be overcome merely by the creation of
                        additional administrative machinery. What is required for the more effective
                        carrying out of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives in the field
                        of countersubversion is the decisive coordination of political, military,
                        economic and covert actions, greater flexibility in integrating into
                        specific covert operations assets already available in our military,
                        diplomatic and economic organizations, and possibly more effective
                        utilization of assets outside of government in the business and academic
                        fields. Consideration should also be given in appropriate instances to
                        seeking the cooperation of our Allies so that their assets would also be
                        available in specific covert counter-subversive programs.</p>

                    <p>1. There appears to be general agreement that since the adoption of <gloss

                            Oct. 30, 1953, <ref target="#pg_577">p. 577</ref>.</note> the time when
                        Soviet Russia will approximate the strength of the United States in nuclear
                        weapons has been shortened considerably.</p>
                    <p>2. Available evidence points to the fact that during the period between now
                        and the time when Soviet Russia approximates the strength of the United
                        States in nuclear weapons, both Soviet Russia and Communist China will
                        continue their efforts to widen their sphere of influence particularly in
                        Asia and Southeast Asia by such methods as subversion and the initiation of
                        civil wars.</p>
                    <p>3. In developing a coordinated action program for the few years remaining
                        before Soviet Russia does approximate the strength of the United States in
                        nuclear weapons, consideration must be given to the type of program it will
                        be necessary to follow after the position of equality is reached.</p>
                    <gap/>
                    <p>5. At the same time, the United States should be prepared to react with force
                        if necessary and advantageous to expansion and subversion supported and
                        supplied by Communist China which, if carried to a successful conclusion,
                        would weaken our position in relation to Soviet Russia. This is an area
                        where no generalized statement of policy can provide ahead of time the
                        answers to the specific situations that may arise.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that we must be prepared to react with armed force against any
                        belligerent move by Communist China.</p>
                    <p>6. Between now and the time when Soviet Russia approximates the strength of
                        the United States in nuclear weapons, the United States should use its
                        present position of superiority as a backdrop for political, psychological
                        and economic measures designed to strengthen the non-Communist nations of
                        Asia and Southeast Asia. This program should be pressed as relentlessly and
                        with as complete abandon as far as sacrifices are concerned as if we were
                        engaged in actual hostilities.</p>
                    <p>Military situations should be dealt with as they arise in such a manner as to
                        make it clear that we will not stand idly by and permit Governments which
                        have moved in the direction of an <pb xml:id="pg_783" n="783" facs="0813"
                        />alignment with the Free World to be undermined by Soviet Russia or
                        Communist China by subversion or by the initiation of civil war.</p>
                    <p>7. Coincident with the carrying forward of this type of program between now
                        and the time when Soviet Russia approximates the strength of the United
                        States in nuclear weapons, a comprehensive program should be put into effect
                        which makes it very apparent to both the enemy and the Free World that we
                        are taking realistic and revolutionary steps which involve genuine
                        sacrifices in order to put the Free World in a position where it will not
                        have to adopt a defeatist or fatalistic attitude when Soviet Russia does
                        approximate the strength of the United States in nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>One aspect of this total program should involve our mobilization base in the
                        following manner:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. As we taper off or bring to an end current defense production of
                            military end-items that may or may not become obsolete, we should take
                            steps to provide adequate capacity for production of new weapons at the
                            rate that would be required immediately following M Day.</item>
                        <item>b. We should identify those comparatively small numbers of end-items
                            that we would need to have in production and keep in production on M
                            Day, if our retaliatory efforts are to be successful, and make sure that
                            we have facilities for the production of such items at locations that
                            are regarded as being the least vulnerable to attack, and that are
                            subjected to security measures which would virtually eliminate the
                            possibility of internal sabotage. Criteria which are utilized in the
                            establishment and operation of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                            installations should be applied to installations that must be available
                            in the interest of effective retaliation. The carrying out of such a
                            policy will involve either the relocation of some facilities or the
                            construction of shadow facilities and the development of detailed plans
                            for putting such facilities into operation.</item>

                    <p>Because economic crisis or collapse can be used effectively by the
                        Communists, there is a widespread opinion that economic improvement and
                        development will make it more difficult for communism to penetrate and will
                        promote free world cohesion. This, in our opinion, is not necessarily so. In
                        fact, it can be demonstrated that in many cases Communist penetration is

                        desirable changes in United States basic security policy. These comments are
                        as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“1. At this time, when ‘Existing Basic National Security Policy’ is
                            under review, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel it their duty specifically
                            to draw attention to the evolution of a situation which, militarily,
                            could involve progressively more serious risks to national security than
                            those we now face. The struggle between the Communist and non-Communist
                            world is now in a critical era and within a period of relatively few
                            years will probably reach a decisive state.</item>
                        <item>“2. There is no acceptable evidence of abandonment or major
                            modification of the Communist objective of achieving ultimate world
                            domination, using armed force, if necessary. There is no abatement of
                            Communist efforts to infiltrate, subvert and control non-Communist
                            Governments. Communist machinery for exerting this effort continues to
                            be augmented and strengthened. Communist armed strength and war-making
                            potential, including capability for thermonuclear attack, continue to
                            increase.</item>
                        <item>“3. This combination of objective and capabilities together comprise a
                            threat to the non-Communist world in general and to our national
                            security in particular. The growth of this threat, with the enormously
                            increased potentiality for destruction, deriving from capability in the
                            thermonuclear field, and growing fear, in certain non-Communist nations
                            of involvement in atomic war, with a definite trend toward neutralism,
                            are some of the major forces in the situation now evolving.</item>
                        <item>“4. The non-Communist world, if it takes positive and timely <hi
                                rend="italic">dynamic</hi> countermeasures, presently has ample
                            resources to meet this situation, and with high chance of maintaining
                            world peace without sacrifice of either vital security interests or
                            fundamental moral principles, or in the event of war being forced upon
                            it, of winning that war beyond any reasonable doubt. On the other hand,
                            failure on the part of the free world and particularly of the United
                            States to take such timely and dynamic action could, within a relatively
                            short span of years, result in the United States finding itself isolated
                            from the rest of the free world and thus placed in such jeopardy as to
                            reduce its freedom of action to two alternatives—that of accommodation
                                <pb xml:id="pg_786" n="786" facs="0816"/>to Soviet designs or
                            contesting such designs under conditions not favorable to our
                            success.</item>
                        <item>“5. Paragraph 45 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 states
                            ’. . . the broad aim of U.S. security policies must be to create, prior
                            to the achievement of mutual atomic plenty, conditions under which the
                            United States and the free world coalition are prepared to meet the
                            Soviet-Communist threat with resolution and to negotiate for its
                            alleviation under proper safeguards.’ When adopted, it was considered
                            that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 provided a basic policy
                            which held promise of achieving this broad aim, despite the lack of
                            concrete definition of the ‘conditions’ to be created. However, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that, in the interim since the adoption of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2, the Soviet-Communist
                            threat has not been reduced, while the time available for the
                            establishment of more secure conditions has appreciably diminished. It
                            is deemed pertinent to the review of current policy to determine whether
                            this lack of progress should be attributed to the policy itself or to
                            the efficacy of steps taken in implementation thereof.</item>
                        <item>“6. The United States rejects the concept of preventive war or acts
                            intended to provoke war. Thus, a definite limit is established beyond
                            which our policy and courses of action to implement that policy should
                            not go. However, there remains a wide latitude between a category of
                            somewhat passive measures which are reactive or counteractive to Soviet
                            acts or threats of aggression and a category of more positive measures
                            to be undertaken ‘even at the risk of but without deliberately provoking
                            war.’ A study of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 discloses
                            that it provides verbal accommodations for either of these categories of
                            security measures. Meaningful evaluation of basic security policy,
                            however, includes recognition of the interpretations given to such
                            policy statements in their actual application. In this sense it is clear
                            that steps taken under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 have
                            not resulted in a reduction of the Soviet-Communist threat. On the
                            contrary, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 as basic security
                            policy has been attended by continued emphasis on reactive-type security
                            measures and continued growth of the threat to the free world.
                            Accordingly, it is believed necessary to remove from <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 its present preponderant
                            commitment to a policy of reaction, with the purpose of providing a
                            basic U.S. security policy of unmistakably positive quality.</item>
                        <item>“7. While <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 has sufficient
                            flexibility to have served as adequate guidance to meet Soviet
                            aggressions occurring during its existence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            feel that in the formulation of subsidiary policies pertaining to
                            particular countries or regions, there have been deviations from the
                            guidelines provided in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 and
                            that, in the application of these policies, the United States has not
                            focused upon the achievement of the broad objective of our basic
                            security policy. It is considered that the timely achievement of the
                            broad objective of U.S. security policy cannot be brought about if the
                            United States is required to defer to the counsel of the most cautious
                            among our Allies or if it is unwilling to undertake certain risks
                            inherent in the adoption of dynamic and positive security measures. In
                            summary, it is the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the objective
                            stated in paragraph 45 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2
                            remains valid but it is imperative that our basic security <pb
                                xml:id="pg_787" n="787" facs="0817"/>policy, when revised, reflect
                            throughout the greater urgency of the present situation, define
                            concretely the conditions which it is the aim of our security policy to
                            create, and direct the formulation of courses of action designed to
                            achieve the basic objective. In the final analysis, the criterion as to
                            each course of action to be adopted should be determined by what best
                            serves the interests of the United States.</item>

                        discussion of the reference problem in terms of a series of topics. With
                        respect to the first of these, “A Statement of the Nature and Scope of the
                        Soviet Threat and Probable Soviet Intentions During the Next Few Years”, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested a
                        postponement of the discussion, with which suggestion the Council concurred.
                        On the second topic, “The Emphasis and Manner of Carrying Out the Existing
                        Policy”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> stated that
                        this, in his opinion, constituted the principal issue before the Council.
                        The Departments of State and Defense, he indicated, differed perceptibly in
                        their views on this topic. He then called on the Secretary of State for an
                        expression of his views on this topic.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> spoke first on
                        the negative side, saying that he thought that the area of policy where we
                        had been most lacking in achievement was primarily in the economic field. We
                        were currently <pb xml:id="pg_789" n="789" facs="0819"/>in pretty good shape
                        from the point of view of our political and military situation. We did
                        obviously lack a dynamic policy in the economic field, and our foreign
                        economic policy was so uncertain that many of our friends in the free world
                        are in doubt whether they ought to tie their economies in with us or, as an
                        alternative, make an accommodation with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>A second serious lack, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, was represented by our failure to create an
                        organization for the effective conduct of subversive and counter-subversive
                        operations against the enemy. When we shift to the non-military struggle
                        with our Communist enemies it is clear that the Communists, who have long
                        been practiced in revolutionary techniques, have achieved successes in both
                        subversion and counter-subversion far exceeding our own. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said he noticed that <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was equally concerned with this problem,
                        and advocated support of the position taken by the Director of Central
                        Intelligence on a more effective organization for this area of activity.</p>
                    <p>In other respects than these, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that our basic policy on the
                        whole was pretty good, even (speaking sarcastically) if it hasn’t got us
                        into war, and he was not sure (again sarcastically) that not getting into
                        war was a bad thing. Certainly our policy could not be described as
                        “craven”. We could have got into a war in Indochina, but we had not done so
                        for reasons which were well known. In the case of the British plane shot
                        down by the Chinese Communists in the area of Hainan Island, we again
                        indicated that we were not fearful, and we shot down Chinese Communist
                        aircraft. Certainly we were not timid with respect to over-flights of Soviet
                        territory by U.S. planes. We were about to conclude a defensive treaty with
                        Formosa which would be a “major challenge” to Communist China. In fact, at a
                        recent meeting in Peiping the Chinese Communists said that they would
                        consider such a treaty virtually an act of war. In Europe the United States
                        had been largely instrumental in achieving the decision by our allies to
                        proceed with the rearmament of Germany despite the Soviet Union. Despite all
                        this, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, it
                        would be difficult to argue that our policies are not strong, firm, and
                        indicative of a willingness to take risks. But our policy was none the less
                        one which fell short of actually provoking war.</p>
                    <p>In one respect only was the United States now facing a general deterioration
                        of its position in the world—namely, the forthcoming achievement of atomic
                        plenty and a nuclear balance of power between the U.S. and the USSR. But
                        how, asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                        were we to prevent the Soviet Union from achieving such a nuclear balance of
                        power without going to war with the USSR? Certainly no actions on the
                        periphery of the Soviet Union would stop the <pb xml:id="pg_790" n="790"
                            facs="0820"/>growth of the atomic capabilities of the Soviet Union. If
                        achievement of this capability were to be stopped, it must be stopped in
                        Russia itself, and this meant action against Russia. This did not mean, of
                        course, that we could not do a great deal along the periphery of the
                        Communist empire to prevent the subversion of free nations.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>, who said that he looked at the situation very much
                        as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> did. The
                        problem as he saw it, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName>, was to maintain our strength and our world
                        leadership. Accordingly, we should never lose sight of the fact that our
                        free society is a very powerful factor in the world situation. We must be
                        willing to fight for the values of our free society. He said that he was
                        accustomed and liked to analyze problems, both inductively and deductively,
                        and he could demonstrate this position by reference to perhaps ten specific
                        cases. Most of the problems which we now confront in the world derive from
                        three things: First, the aftermath of World War II; second, from the
                        collapse of colonialism which, after all, the United States had itself in a
                        way begun; and third, while naturally we don’t believe in Communism
                        ourselves, it is not so much Communism that we are fighting as it is Soviet
                        imperialist Communism. As proof of this Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> cited our attitude toward
                        Yugoslavia, and further indicated that we would not worry so much about
                        Communist China were it not for that country’s alliance with the USSR. It
                        was, in short, the international crusade of Communism that so concerned us.
                        For these reasons Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> thought it would be a good thing to base our overall
                        national security policy on the case-by-case study to which he had referred
                        at the outset of his remarks.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        pointed out that another serious problem was posed by the changing
                        techniques of modern warfare, together with the weapons available to us.
                        Some people were anxious to shift to these new weapons too radically. Others
                        appeared to wish to fight the next world war as we had fought World War II.
                        It was necessary to make a wise choice between these two extremes. And,
                        furthermore, we must have patience in our effort to defer another world war
                        for long enough to permit the seeds of decay which were inherent in
                        Communism to have their effect.</p>
                    <p>Called on by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he
                        would not differ from the position taken by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, but that he would change the
                        emphasis by putting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ last position, with regard to the achievement of
                        nuclear balance of power, in the first place. He said he would also agree
                        with the Defense position as to the desirability of reaching a basic policy
                        position by reference to a case-by-case study. The test should be in each
                        case <pb xml:id="pg_791" n="791" facs="0821"/>whether or not a proposed
                        course of action resulted in the weakening of the power of the Soviet Union.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> commented that he had
                        rarely seen a stronger position than that taken by Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> in his written report. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName>, however,
                        explained and qualified this position.</p>
                    <p>The President, speaking with conviction, said that it was absolutely
                        essential, if possible, to clarify the basis of the Council’s present
                        discussion. It was certainly not necessary to restate the history of United
                        States policy. He also expressed a strong agreement with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>’s proposal for proceeding on a
                        case-by-case basis. But in many respects, despite the plea for a more
                        dynamic U.S. policy, our policies were not dynamic, but negative. An example
                        was our policy with respect to trade between the free world and Communist
                        China. In any event, the critics of our current policy certainly ought to
                        refer to specific forthcoming problems and decide what they will do when the
                        problem actually must be faced. He agreed, he said, with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> as to the desirability of a
                        dynamic U.S. policy, but he wished this policy to be responsive to specific
                        cases and situations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that perhaps
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> would be able
                        to suggest such specific actions and cases. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that he would try to
                        do so, but at first wished to go back to the problem of specifics. He then
                        referred to the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which had been expressed
                        more than once in the recent past, on the general subject of the U.S.
                        position upon the attainment of nuclear balance by the USSR. When this
                        occurred, warned Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, the Chiefs of Staff had pointed out that the
                        relative power position of the U.S. would have so changed that the U.S.
                        could no longer count on the Russians being afraid of starting general war.
                        Moreover, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had pointed out that they could no
                        longer guarantee a successful outcome for the U.S. in such a war, and had
                        felt that they must bring these facts to the attention of the President and
                        the National Security Council. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName> went on to say that assuming that the objectives of
                        Soviet Communism were unchanged, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that
                        some time or other the Soviet Union will elect to force the issue.
                        Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs had concluded that the United States has only
                        a limited period of time with which to reach an accommodation with the
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the subject of specific courses of action, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that the Chiefs
                        had felt that they could not suggest specific courses of action because such
                        courses of action could not, in the nature of things, be exclusively
                        military. They would also include diplomatic, political, economic, and
                        propaganda actions. All the Chiefs could do was to guarantee that if such
                        courses of action <pb xml:id="pg_792" n="792" facs="0822"/>did result either
                        in a limited or a full-scale war, the outcome for the United States, <hi
                            rend="italic">prior to Soviet achievement of atomic plenty,</hi> would
                        be successful. All agree, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, that Soviet policy since 1945 has operated at the
                        risk of but not deliberately provoking general war, with the objective of
                        dividing and subverting the free world. On the whole this Soviet policy had
                        been very successful, as Indochina had already illustrated. We are now
                        indeed witnessing the result of what might be described as lack of courage
                        of our allies. What we can hope to retrieve in Indochina, if anything, is
                        very debatable. Moreover, we are going to face—and perhaps within the next
                        six months—still another situation where the Communists are certain to
                        generate further difficulties between us and our French allies. For the
                        situation in North Africa, confronting us with a very grave dilemma, will
                        involve the possibility of either losing our whole position in the Middle
                        East by offending the Arabs, or else risking the rupture of our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> position by offending the French.</p>
                    <p>In sum, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>,
                        the Joint Chiefs feel that if we continue to pursue a policy of simply
                        reacting to Communist initiatives, instead of a policy of forestalling
                        Communist action, we cannot hope for anything but a showdown with Soviet
                        Communists by 1959 or 1960.</p>
                    <p>The President, again speaking with considerable forcefulness, said that he
                        was completely unable as yet to perceive a fundamental difference in the
                        approach to basic national security policy among the departments, despite
                        whatever the words spelled out. On the other hand, if our present security
                        policy was as completely futile as Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> was saying, there would
                        obviously be no need for the Soviet Union to go to war with us; they would
                        achieve their objectives readily enough without resort to war. Where,
                        however, asked the President, were the real differences between the
                        departments and agencies?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that perhaps
                        the real difference lay in what the Secretary of State had said in his
                        report—namely, that the United States should not take actions against the
                        Communists which were provocative of war. If we did get into war, we should
                        try to limit such a war. Contrary to this position, Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> seemed to be calling on the
                        United States to take greater risks of getting into war without, however,
                        actually trying to provoke such a war.</p>
                    <p>Speaking with impatience, the President said yes, but asked where and how we
                        got more dynamic. He still insisted that everyone really seemed to be in
                        fundamental agreement on our basic policy.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_793" n="793" facs="0823"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said it was
                        clear to him that while the United States was certainly very strong
                        militarily, such military strength alone did not provide the answer to our
                        problems. Even if our military power had been twice as great as it actually
                        had been over the last two years, things would not have happened any
                        differently in this period. For the future, the great issue was how to spend
                        our money in the right places in defense of our national security. If we
                        spend too little money we will invite aggression; if we spend too much money
                        we will get into a war. This always happened when a military establishment
                        got too big. There was a point of optimum security, insisted Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, which was neither
                        too little nor too great, and it was this level which we must find. How we
                        work out the varying difficult situations which we have inherited from the
                        past and for which we were not responsible, was something which required
                        careful study. The business of the Defense Department, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, was of course
                        primarily military, and for that reason their suggestions might have the
                        appearance of differing strongly from the suggestions of other departments.
                        But they felt that a high-level interdepartmental group should take this
                        problem in hand and work out the right courses of action, as the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had recommended. We should list our problems and have such a
                        group go over them one at a time and suggest the solution.</p>
                    <p>At the end of his statement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> urged the Service Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff to speak their minds if they were moved to say anything on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DULLESAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that there
                        seemed to be general agreement on the intelligence background of this
                        problem, and that he agreed specifically with Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>’s predictions as to the
                        Soviets being relatively stronger in five years. In the interim they would
                        continue to carry on the cold war, and what do we do in response? He added
                        that he had forwarded suggestions to Director <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUGHESRR1">Hughes</persName> regarding improved means of
                        mobilizing our assets in the cold-war struggle. We have all the elements we
                        require, but there is need for a more effective organization to capitalize
                        on them.</p>
                    <p>The President interrupted Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> to express his
                        hearty agreement, and the latter went on to point out that we were receiving
                        no help from our allies in this field. . . .</p>
                    <p>The President again expressed agreement with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>,
                        but insisted that what he proposed was already covered by existing and
                        agreed U.S. policy, and no policy change was required. Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> said that all that was needed was a “more
                        aggressive tone”.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the
                        view that the Council was now moving in the direction of establishing
                        priorities in our national security policies. First priority had formerly
                        been accorded to the defense <pb xml:id="pg_794" n="794" facs="0824"/>of
                        Western Europe. This had largely been achieved, and first priority now must
                        be accorded the preventing of the destruction of the United States itself
                        through nuclear attack. Other pressing needs were for acceleration of the
                        build-up of capital resources in underdeveloped areas of the free world, and
                        development of an effective organization to counter Communist subversion of
                        free countries. All the above, said Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, were covered in existing
                        policy papers, but not in terms of clear priorities. Moreover, organization
                        for carrying out these policies needed to be revised. Finally, it was
                        essential that we “sell” the European states on the proposition that the
                        impregnability of the United States was essential for their own
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that there
                        was nothing basically the matter with our national security policies, and he
                        personally was not “too discouraged” as to actual results. The losses we had
                        sustained were not as great as you might think at first. The U.S. did not
                        need more aggressive security policies, but rather more intelligent
                        execution of those already on the books—better courses of action.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the latter task was precisely what this body (the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) was here to accomplish. He once
                        again repeated his inability to detect basic policy differences among the
                        Council members, and added that what “we’ve really been talking was not
                        policy but operations.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> had taken the
                        position earlier that unless the U.S. undertook more positive measures
                        against the Communist enemy, it would be isolated in the world by 1960 and
                        wide open to Soviet attack. That much was clear. The Secretary of State’s
                        views did not reflect so pessimistic an outlook. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> asked Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> if this wasn’t the essential
                        policy difference between himself and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President again said that if we were in so precarious a position in I960
                        as Defense believed, it wouldn’t be necessary for the Russians to resort to
                        nuclear attack in order to take over the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> denied that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> had accurately stated
                        the difference of view between himself and Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>. The only way in which the
                        views of the Joint Chiefs involved a difference with his own was that the
                        Chiefs’ paper favored the U.S. taking greater risks for bigger goals. His
                        guess was, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, that what the military was really advocating was
                        that we should tell the Soviets that they must restore freedom to
                        Czechoslovakia by a certain date “or else”. Was this correct? In any event,
                        the U.S. had already taken many risks and, except for the set-back in
                        Indochina, with pretty good results. As Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_795"
                            n="795" facs="0825"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> had earlier pointed out,
                        the failure in Indochina stemmed from decisions and policies taken long ago
                        by the French and over which we had no control and which we could not
                        change. Thus we come back to the question of what we can do now to prevent
                        the Soviets from achieving nuclear balance with the United States. We can’t
                        stop this by action in Indochina, nor indeed in China itself. The Joint
                        Chiefs’ views don’t suggest any way of stopping it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that he could not
                        answer the Secretary of State, but that perhaps Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> could.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that he
                        could do so only in a negative way. He explained that General Guillaume had
                        been talking with him during his recent visit. Regarding Indochina,
                        Guillaume had argued that it was essential for France to withdraw her troops
                        from the area as fast as possible in order to send them to French North
                        Africa where the situation was becoming critical. French forces in Indochina
                        would be reduced to 125, 000 by the end of January 1955. Guillaume explained
                        that many of his country men had virtually abandoned hope of a successful
                        outcome in South Vietnam. The Vietminh had turned out to be <hi
                            rend="italic">real</hi> Communists, and there was little chance of
                        effective counteraction.</p>
                    <p>From this point General Guillaume led into the next great conflict between
                        Communism and the free world, which would occur in North Africa. The French,
                        he said, were determined to hold this area, and the only way to do so was to
                        put in sufficient military force.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that
                        such a French policy in North Africa would be bound to cause tension between
                        France and the United States. Guillaume replied that he realized this, but
                        hoped that the French would be able to explain to us why such a repressive
                        policy was necessary. In short, the French reasoned that if French Africa
                        were lost to the Arabs, it would in short order thereafter be lost to the
                        Western world.</p>
                    <p>So, concluded Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>,
                        going back to the position of the Chiefs of Staff on the present paper,
                        Guillaume’s conversations seemed to him (<persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>) to show clearly that the Communists are engaging in
                        another divisive action against the free world allies, and it will present
                        the U.S. with a serious dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then inquired of
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> how the
                        military people would solve the problem of North Africa. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said they would advocate
                        outright support of the Arabs against the French. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked with asperity if
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> were not
                        making a political rather than a military decision. This was the
                        responsibility of the State Department, not the military.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_796" n="796" facs="0826"/>
                    <p>The President predicted that the French were about to repeat in North Africa
                        the serious mistakes they had made in Indochina. Military force alone would
                        not hold these colonies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> intervened to say that
                        this turn in the discussion led rather naturally into Topic III, “Validity
                        of Our Collective Security System to which Major Allies throughout the World
                        Make Equitable Contributions”. He called on Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, who said that he had nothing
                        to say on this topic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        then asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> to
                        enlarge on the point made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff with regard to the
                        danger in the U.S. deferring to the most cautious of its allies.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> cited the
                        events in Indochina last spring as a concrete illustration of the military’s
                        contention. We had in this instance in effect given Britain and France a
                        veto on U.S. actions. North Africa will probably be a case of the same sort.
                        This would play into the hands of the Commies, who desire either to destroy
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by splitting France from the U.S.,
                        or else to destroy our whole position in the Middle East by splitting the
                        Arabs from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> reminded Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> of the contents of
                        our North African policy, but the latter expressed strong doubt that the
                        French would solve their problem in North Africa by giving a larger degree
                        of freedom to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>With respect to North Africa, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> reiterated feelingly that it was basically a
                        political problem and therefore the business of the State Department.
                        Moreover, he questioned in any case whether Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>’s solution was correct. It
                        was a most serious problem which it was State’s business to think through.
                        To tell the French today that the U.S. would give full support to the Arab
                        position on North Africa would undoubtedly result in French refusal to
                        ratify the London and Paris accords. This in turn would end all hope of
                        German rearmament, on which he understood the Chiefs of Staff to place great
                        store. Once again, he insisted, this was the business of the State
                        Department, not the Defense Department.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> said in effect
                        that he was not intent on invading the prerogatives of the State Department,
                        and had only reluctantly picked out North Africa in response to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>’s “admonition” to cite
                        an illustration of the U.S. tendency to defer to the most timid of its
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion of the situation in North Africa, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> brought the
                        conversation back to Indochina. He said that while of course he was very
                        disappointed in the results, he did not feel quite as Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> did as to our “faint-hearted
                        allies”. The British and Canadians were not timid. They simply didn’t <pb
                            xml:id="pg_797" n="797" facs="0827"/>think it was “smart” to team up
                        with the French in an Indochina war because French policies in this area had
                        been wrong for many years back. The results of past errors made the
                        situation hopeless. The French <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have been able
                        to defeat the Vietminh in strict military terms, but there was no “cause” to
                        which the French could rally the native population.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that the
                        Council turn to Topic IV, “General Character of U.S. Economic and Military
                        Assistance”. After summarizing the written suggestions of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STREIBERTTC1">Streibert</persName> (U.S.I.A.) on the
                        subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> asked
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> if he wished
                        to add anything. The latter replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> had stated his position very well. The number of
                        divisions which the nations of the free world had on the ground was now less
                        important as a result of the introduction of the nuclear element. Empahsis
                        must therefore be shifted to capital development in these countries. Also we
                        must get our more prosperous allies to assist us to assist the
                        underdeveloped areas of the free world. In conclusion, Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said he also accepted the
                        point made by the U.S.I.A.: economic development alone would not do the job
                        of saving these areas from Communism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STREIBERTTC1">Streibert</persName> said that he had
                        nothing to add to his written suggestions.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff would like to defer for a time any positive
                        recommendations on the topic. But he very much doubted if we had yet reached
                        the point where we could run the serious risk of cutting down significantly
                        on the military buildup of the free world nations. Citing Turkey and
                        Portugal’s requests for additional military assistance, he indicated that he
                        thought the U.S. too far committed to most of its military aid programs to
                        be able to withdraw gracefully before completion of the programs.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> admitted that
                        there were exceptions, and that Turkey might well be one. But was the
                        20-division program for Korea wise? Should it not be scaled down. The same
                        solution might well result from General <persName corresp="#p_COLLINSGJL1"
                            >Collins</persName>’ recommendations on South Vietnam. The economic
                        implications of these large, modernized, military establishments were
                        tremendous, and it was necessary to establish a sound balance between
                        economic and military requirements.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that he
                        was well aware of the heavy cost to the U.S. of supporting these extensive
                        military assistance programs. It would perhaps be possible to reduce the
                        current level of the South Korean armed forces because if war again broke
                        out there, it would not be conducted as had the earlier one. However, the
                        South Koreans objected strongly to the redeployment of U.S. divisions. <pb
                            xml:id="pg_798" n="798" facs="0828"/>By and large, concluded Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName>, he could not see
                        how we could reduce the force goals of our allies around the world at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> stated that
                        balance is what must be achieved in these assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to Topic V,
                        “The Mobilization Base”, and asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1"
                            >Flemming</persName> if he had any further views. The latter replied
                        that on the second of his two written suggestions, he merely wanted to
                        reemphasize. The first suggestion was scheduled for discussion by the
                        Council next week and he would withhold comment at this time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HUGHESRR1">Hughes</persName> inquired with respect
                        to the first point (steps to provide adequate capacity for production of
                        new-type weapons at the rate that would be required immediately following
                        M–Day) whether substantial progress had not already been made. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> did not believe the
                        progress could be called really substantial.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> commented that
                        when he first came to Washington, it had been clear to him that no one had
                        thought through how you maintained a mobilization base after the orders for
                        materials ran out. This and other areas of the mobilization base needed
                        further study, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> was sure we could greatly improve our present
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to Topic
                        VI, “Fiscal Policy”, and described the suggestions of <persName

                        as “refreshing for their specificity”. The President interrupted to say that
                        here again we should take account of the meaning of the words and not the
                        words themselves. We are all already in agreement with
                            <persName>Arthur</persName>’s first point. Dr. <persName

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that Topic

                        the form of a basic policy formulation. The only comment was from the
                        President, who said that if his favorite authors were quoted in an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy statement, a credit line should be
                        included (laughter).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that Topic
                        IX (“East-West Trade”) would be considered at next week’s Council meeting.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName>, however,
                        asked to say a word now. He felt it was obvious that the <pb xml:id="pg_799"
                            n="799" facs="0829"/>U.S. could not “sit still” on this problem of
                        East-West trade, particularly as respected Communist China. We cannot long
                        maintain our demands for a virtual embargo. The longer we remain sitting,
                        the worse it will be for our interests. We will lose our friends and at the
                        same time fail to make any kind of deal with our enemies. The restrictions
                        on free world trade with Communist China would eventually have to come down
                        to the level of the restrictions against such trade with the European Soviet
                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                        considerable hesitation about relaxing restrictions on trade with Communist
                        China at this moment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then inquired whether
                        he could assume that the Council desired the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Planning Board to produce a revised basic national security
                        policy reflecting the views expressed at the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired
                        whether there was not room in our policy for greater emphasis on ways and
                        means of dividing the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President summarized his view that our national security policies were
                        now well-stated. What he wanted, in addition, was advance identification on
                        problems that were coming up. Perhaps a study by government people or by
                        foundations like that at 68th and <persName corresp="#p_ARMSTRONGWPJ1"
                            >Park</persName> (Council on Foreign Relations) could anticipate such
                        problems and list possible solutions to them. In any case, said the
                        President, he was tired of abstractions; they got him down.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said that the
                        Council should focus its undivided attention on three prime points:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. To see to it that the USSR never got in a position to knock out the
                            U.S.</item>
                        <item>2. To see to it that the Soviets could seize no further free world
                            territory without an act of <hi rend="italic">overt</hi>
                            aggression.</item>
                        <item>3. To study how to put strains on the Soviet bloc in order to cause
                            dissension and to divide the bloc.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> asked about the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation for a high-level
                        interdepartmental group to recommend courses of action to carry out the
                        objectives of our revised basic security policy. The President said he would
                        consider this recommendation and talk it over later with Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_RADFORDAAW1">Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he supposed that it
                        was the specific function of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Planning Board to recommend courses of action. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that this case was a
                        little different. The group recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> conceived the problem as more operational than
                        policy-forming, and of the group itself as an “action committee”.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> indicated, with respect
                        to the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> Progress Report, that the

                        date. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed with
                        this point, stating that he thought, as a result of recent conferences which

                            >Peterson</persName> and General Chidlaw, that the desired objective

                        left the Cabinet Room.</p>
                    <p>The President then commented that one of the points that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had dwelt on in his
                        statement was one with which he, the President, was living all the
                        time—namely, what do you do with the world after you have won victory in
                        such a catastrophic nuclear war? The President went on to say that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> appeared to
                        believe that if the United States didn’t resort to nuclear attack in general
                        war, the Russians in turn would not use such weapons, and the President said
                        he did not believe any such thing. Furthermore, said the President, he had a
                        strong feeling that General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> was sincere in his view of the need for balanced
                        U.S. military forces rather than reliance upon atomic retaliatory capacity.
                        In other words, thought the President, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> was not merely presenting a
                        “parochial”’ Army viewpoint. On the other hand, said the President, the
                        United States could not afford to prepare to fight all kinds of wars and
                        still preserve its free economy and its basic institutions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that we
                        must not quarrel over words. Ordinary fission weapons have a quite different
                        effect from thermonuclear weapons. Moreover, if we swept over Soviet Russia
                        and China with vast land armies we would have the same or similar problems
                        as those outlined by General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> as constituting the bitter aftermath of a nuclear
                        war. The President thought not quite the same problems. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> also underlined the importance
                        of the time factor in another war. He said he could not conceive of sending
                        millions of American troops to fight in Europe while the <pb xml:id="pg_805"
                            n="805" facs="0835"/>United States itself was under atomic attack. For
                        one thing, it would be impossible to get them across the ocean.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> also indicated
                        that this was a split in views among the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and that
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> was making a
                        justification for a much larger Army. It was quite proper for General
                            <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> to advocate larger
                        Army forces, but the Council should recognize what it was hearing. In fact,
                        said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>, he would
                        not want to have a Chief of Staff of the Army who did not fight for the
                        objectives and requirements of his Service.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired
                        whether it would be fruitful to have a special group undertake to make a
                        study of the difficult problem which General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had underlined and on which
                        the President had commented—namely, how to organize the victory after the
                        end of a nuclear war—how the U.S. could rebuild a shattered world without
                        destroying its own economy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> thought that
                        such a study would be worthwhile because, among other reasons, if you put
                        some of the measures which would result from the study in effect now you
                        might have a better chance of avoiding a third world war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, speaking
                        with great force, said there was a three-fold difference between the view
                        presented by General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>
                        and the views held by the rest of us. First, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> started with the one-sided
                        premise that the whole effort should be directed to maintaining the U.S.
                        military posture, with little or no regard for the maintenance of the U.S.
                        economy. The President thought that this did something less than justice to
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s views.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName> was also clearly wrong in his assumption that if the
                        United States did not resort to nuclear warfare the Russians would not. The
                        President said he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> on this point, although it was significant that in
                        World War II the Germans had not resorted to the use of poison gas. Even
                        Hitler was too horrified at the prospect of gas warfare when he hesitated to
                        use gas, and, of course, he also feared that the allies would retaliate with
                        something as bad or worse. There were some, said the President, who believe
                        that modern warfare imposes its own limitations.</p>
                    <p>His third point, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, was that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1">Ridgway</persName> was arguing in favor of all
                        kinds of forces designed to fight all kinds of war at all times. For the
                        United States to maintain such forces was absolutely impossible.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that our only chance of victory in a third world war
                        against the Soviet Union would be to paralyze the enemy at the outset of the
                        war. Since we cannot keep the United <pb xml:id="pg_806" n="806" facs="0836"
                        />States an armed camp or a garrison state, we must make plans to use the
                        atom bomb if we become involved in a war. We are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                        going to provoke the war, and that is why we have got to be patient. If war
                        comes, the other fellow must have started it. Otherwise we would not be in a
                        position to use the nuclear weapon, and we have got to be in a position to
                        use that weapon if we are to preserve our institutions in peace and win the
                        victory in war.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said he doubted
                        the entire validity of General <persName corresp="#p_RIDGWAYGMB1"
                            >Ridgway</persName>’s thesis that we would draw down upon ourselves the
                        hatred of most of mankind if we resorted to atomic warfare. History showed
                        that the great hatreds were engendered in the post-war period rather than
                        during the time of the actual conflict.</p>

                    <p>It is the President’s desire that this preliminary Council discussion of the
                        enclosed tentative draft take place before delivery to the Congress of the
                        State-of-the-Union Message. It is recognized that, particularly because of
                        the absence of certain Council members at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> meetings in Europe during the week preceding December 21,
                        there may not be sufficient opportunity before that Council meeting for
                        thorough departmental review of the enclosed tentative draft. Accordingly,
                        the President has approved that final Council action on the enclosed draft
                        may be deferred to the first Council meeting in January 1955. The President,
                        however, wishes the Council members and advisers, including the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff, to be prepared with their tentative views on the enclosed draft at
                        the December 21 meeting, reserving final expression of their views if
                        desired until the January meeting.</p>
                    <p>The enclosed draft statement of policy, in the form finally adopted and
                        approved, is intended to supersede <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2
                        and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/2, and to constitute the basic
                        guide in the implementation of all other National Security policies,
                        superseding any provisions in such other policies as may be in conflict with
                        this basic policy.</p>

                    <p>1. Soviet air-atomic capabilities are rapidly increasing. Already the USSR
                        has the capacity to inflict widespread devastation on major free world
                        countries allied to the U.S. and serious damage to the U.S. itself. Over
                        approximately the next five years the USSR will almost certainly develop the
                            <hi rend="italic">net</hi> capability to strike a crippling blow at the
                        United States.<note n="‡" xml:id="d138fn-sym7">The Director of the Bureau of

                    </p>
                    <p>2. At present the U.S. can inflict massive damage on the Communist bloc by
                        nuclear striking power. Even when the USSR arrives at the point where it can
                        strike a crippling blow at the U.S., the U.S. will still be able to inflict
                        equal or greater damage on the USSR, provided that it takes adequate
                        measures to protect its effective retaliatory power.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviet guided missile program, over the next few years will bring
                        increasingly longer-range missiles into production. Assuming an intensive
                        effort, the USSR may develop roughly by 1963 (I960 at the earliest)
                        operational intercontinental ballistic missiles. The U.S. program for
                        missiles of this type should approximate this timetable, provided that
                        intensive effort continues. There is no known defense against such missiles
                        at this time.</p>
                    <p>4. Thus a situation is approaching in which a total war involving use by both
                        sides of available weapons would bring about such extensive destruction as
                        to threaten the survival of both Western civilization <pb xml:id="pg_809"
                            n="809" facs="0839"/>and the Soviet system. This situation could create
                        a condition of mutual deterrence, in which each side would be strongly
                        inhibited from deliberately initiating general war or taking actions which
                        it regarded as materially increasing the risk of general war. In any case,
                        war would remain a possibility, if only because of the element of
                        miscalculation by either side or because of a technological break-through by
                        the Soviets leading them to believe they could destroy the U.S. without
                        effective retaliation.</p>
                    <p>5. The Communist bloc will maintain and further develop formidable
                        conventional forces, with improved combat effectiveness and a large increase
                        in submarines. The principal limitations will be logistic problems and
                        deficiencies in specialized experience, training and equipment.</p>
                    <p>6. The free world can make substantial progress in building military strength
                        through the continued improvement of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        forces, the introduction of West German units, some Japanese rearmament, and
                        the progressive development of new weapons systems and of production
                        facilities. Introduction of nuclear weapons into the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense system on the basis of agreed
                        policy will be of crucial importance. <hi rend="italic">Provided that</hi>
                        it has the will to do so, the free world coalition has the capacity to
                        maintain sufficient armed strength, along with U.S. strategic nuclear
                        striking power, to constitute a major deterrent to Communist military
                        aggression and to maximize the chances of dealing effectively with such
                        aggression if it should occur.</p>
                    <p>7. The stability of the USSR and its hold over the European satellites are
                        unlikely to be seriously shaken over the next few years, despite measures
                        which the U.S. may find it feasible to take to weaken Soviet control.
                        However, the control system of the USSR will continue to be faced with
                        important problems (such as discontent in the satellites, agricultural
                        difficulties, and pressures for satisfying consumer wants), some of which
                        may be susceptible to a limited degree of exploitation from outside.</p>
                    <p>8. Communist China is likely to continue vigorous and cohesive, but will face
                        internal problems much greater than those of the USSR. The Sino-Soviet tie
                        probably will remain strong for the next few years not only for ideological
                        reasons but also because it furthers the purposes of both parties.</p>
                    <p>9. In absolute terms, the growth of the U.S. economy should be greater than
                        that of the USSR, and U.S. productive capacity in 1959 will still be more
                        than twice that of the USSR. Nevertheless, the economic growth of the USSR
                        can be expected to continue at a rate considerably higher than that of the
                        U.S. or of other major free world countries. The difference in growth rates
                        will probably be even greater in the industrial sector, despite some
                        increased <pb xml:id="pg_810" n="810" facs="0840"/>Soviet emphasis on
                        agriculture and consumer goods. Moreover, the USSR will be devoting to
                        capital investment, and to uses contributing to war potential, a much
                        greater proportion of its resources.</p>
                    <p>10. Soviet economic progress will be for many peoples with lower living
                        standards an impressive example, and will probably constitute an important
                        element in spreading Soviet influence, especially in Asia. Communist China,
                        if its industrialization continues as expected at a rate relatively rapid as
                        compared with that of other Asian countries, will also exert considerable
                        attractive forces on Asian peoples, especially if economic improvement in
                        free Asia is slow or non-existent.</p>
                    <p>11. The existing structure of U.S. alliances can probably be maintained, and
                        may possibly be extended, particularly in the Middle East. However, there
                        will be serious strains on these alliances, especially the ties between the
                        U.S. and its major allies, resulting from growing fears of atomic war on the
                        part of the allies, differing attitudes on China, and greater receptivity by
                        the allies to Soviet overtures. Our allies will probably be more reluctant
                        than the U.S. to participate in actions which appear to them to involve
                        appreciable risks of war in order to prevent further Communist advances in
                        areas which do not directly involve their vital interests.</p>
                    <p>12. Underdeveloped countries will continue to be a major source of weakness
                        in the position of the free world, owing to such factors as political
                        instability, economic backwardness, extreme nationalism, and the colonial
                        issue. The dangers of subversion will be great, especially in countries
                        under the shadow of Communist power and subject to direct Communist
                        pressures and intervention. In Southeast Asia the present situation is
                        extremely precarious. Failure of the free world to deal more effectively
                        with the problems of underdeveloped areas will weaken the free world and
                        benefit international communism, even in countries where actual Communist
                        take-over is not imminent.</p>
                    <p>13. As the lines between the Communist bloc and the Western coalition have
                        come to be more clearly drawn over the last few years, a situation has
                        arisen in which any further Communist territorial gain would have an
                        unfavorable impact within the free world that might be out of all proportion
                        to the strategic or economic significance of the territory lost.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Probable Soviet and Chinese Communist Intentions and
                            Strategy</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>14. The USSR has not modified its basic hostility toward the non-Communist
                        world, and especially toward the U.S. as the power center of that world, or
                        its belief in the ultimate triumph of Communism. The Soviet leaders can be
                        expected to seek constantly, by every means they find advantageous, to
                        extend Communist power <pb xml:id="pg_811" n="811" facs="0841"/>and to
                        weaken those forces, especially U.S. power and influence, which they regard
                        as inexorable enemies of their system. However, they will almost certainly
                        avoid pursuing their long-term goals in ways which jeopardize the security
                        of the regime or their control of the Communist bloc. Soviet objectives can
                        be listed as follows, in descending order of importance:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. The security of the regime and of the USSR.</item>
                        <item>b. Maintaining the Soviet hold on the European satellites, and keeping
                            China within the Communist bloc.</item>
                        <item>c. Elimination of U.S. influence from Eurasia, and the isolation of
                            the U.S.</item>
                        <item>d. Expansion of Soviet Communist power throughout Eurasia.</item>
                        <item>e. Elimination of the U.S. as a competing power center.</item>
                        <item>f. The spread of Communism throughout the world.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>15. Communist China remains bitterly hostile to the U.S., and ostensibly
                        committed to the conquest of Formosa. It will attempt to expand its power on
                        the mainland of Asia and to expel U.S. power and influence therefrom. In
                        pursuit of this end, it probably will place primary emphasis on penetration
                        and support of subversion in neighboring countries.</p>
                    <p>16. Provided that the U.S. and free world have at all times an adequate
                        military posture and the necessary determination, it appears unlikely that,
                        within the next five years, the USSR or Communist China will deliberately
                        initiate war, or engage in overt military aggression if in its judgement
                        such aggression would involve appreciable risk of war with the U.S.<note
                            n="‡" xml:id="d138fn-sym71">An important possible exception to this
                            estimate is a Chinese Communist attack on Formosa and the Pescadores.
                            The Chinese Communists will almost certainly increase their probing
                            actions against the Nationalist-held off-shore islands and will probably
                            try to seize them, if they believe this can be done without bringing on
                            major hostilities with the U.S. A further possibility of Communist
                            aggression is a Viet Minh attack on South Vietnam in the event the 1956
                            elections are blocked by Western action. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> They will try to avoid courses of action which in their
                        judgment will clearly involve such risk. However, they probably would not be
                        deterred by the risk of general war from taking military counteraction
                        against Western actions considered to be an imminent threat to their
                        security. Moreover, general war might occur as the climax of a series of
                        actions and counteractions which neither side originally intended to lead to
                        that result.</p>
                    <p>17. The Soviet switch to a “soft” line, since the death of <persName
                            corresp="#p_STALIN1">Stalin</persName> and increasingly in recent
                        months, is a significant new factor in the situation. The Soviet leaders
                        almost certainly regard this “peace offensive” as their most effective
                        present tactic for dividing the free world and isolating the U.S. from its
                        allies. A principal aim is to prevent the rearmament of West Germany in
                        association <pb xml:id="pg_812" n="812" facs="0842"/>with the Western
                        powers. If this attempt fails, the Soviets may revert to a more
                        uncompromising and menacing posture. The current “soft” line may also be
                        motivated, however, by domestic preoccupations and fear of general war, and
                        the Soviets may therefore desire an extended period of reduced tensions.
                        Even should that be the case, Soviet policy will mainly seek tacit
                        understanding not to resort to force to change the present territorial
                        division between the Communist bloc and the free world. In any event,
                        whatever Soviet concessions are made will, for some time, almost certainly
                        be confined to relatively minor issues. Although it appears very unlikely,
                        the Soviet leaders might be led by the fear of nuclear destruction to accept
                        an effective system of armaments control, with whatever changes would
                        thereby be required in their present practices and concepts.</p>
                    <p>18. If the Soviet “soft” line is not reversed, our allies will be eager to
                        explore it seriously, and will probably wish, in seeking a basis of
                        “coexistence”, to go to further lengths than the U.S. will find prudent.
                        Even if the USSR offers no real concessions, these tendencies will probably
                        persist, supported by large segments of public opinion. It will be a major
                        task, therefore, to maintain the necessary unity and resolution in the free
                        world coalition if the Soviet “peace offensive” continues.</p>
                    <p>19. Despite the talk of “coexistence”, the Communist powers will continue
                        strenuous efforts to weaken and disrupt free-world strength and unity and to
                        expand the area of their control, principally by subversion (including the
                        support of insurrection), while avoiding involvement of the main sources of
                        Communist power. This strategy will probably present the free world with its
                        most serious challenge and greatest danger in the next few years.</p>
                    <p>20. Attainment by the USSR of the capacity to inflict crippling damage on the
                        U.S. almost certainly would not tempt the Soviets to initiate general war,
                        unless they believed that they could neutralize, or by initial surprise
                        could destroy, U.S. retaliatory power before it could be used. They will
                        continue to be extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in which the
                        USSR would be likely to be subjected even to limited nuclear attack. After
                        attaining atomic plenty, however, the Communist powers probably will
                        increase the pace of their attempts at progressive local expansion,
                        supported by force or threat of force, provided they estimate that such
                        action can succeed and will not provoke U.S. counteraction involving
                        appreciable risk of general war.<note n="§" xml:id="d138fn-sym3">State,

                    <p>24. The Soviet bloc–free world conflict can be resolved in accordance with
                        U.S. security interests only through either (a) overthrow of the Soviet
                        regime and its replacement by a government with no expansionist or other
                        objectives inconsistent with U.S. security; or (b) modification of the
                        Soviet system so that its leaders for practical purposes abandon
                        expansionist policies and accept either formal or <hi rend="italic">de

                    <p>25. The U.S. and its allies have no foreseeable prospect of stopping the
                        growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing Soviet armed
                        strength—the core of Communist power— [or of significantly reducing other
                        basic Communist military strength,] <note n="‡‡" xml:id="d138fn-sym8">State,

                        The initiation by the U.S. of such action for this purpose is not an
                        acceptable course either to the U.S. or its major allies.</p>
                    <p>26. Hence, U.S. policies must be designed to affect the conduct of the
                        Communist regimes, especially that of the USSR, in ways that further U.S.

                        expansionist policies. In pursuing this general strategy, our effort should
                        be directed to:</p>

                            exploiting differences between such regimes in ways consistent with this
                            strategy.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>27. To carry out effectively this general strategy will require a flexible
                        combination of military, political, economic, propaganda, and covert actions
                        which enables the full exercise of U.S. initiative. These actions must be so
                        coordinated as to reinforce one another.</p>
                    <p>28. Provided that it is resolutely pursued, this general strategy offers the
                        best hope of bringing about at least a prolonged period of armed truce, and
                        ultimately a peaceful resolution of the Soviet bloc-free world conflict and
                        a peaceful and orderly world environment. Failure resolutely to pursue this
                        general strategy could, within a relatively short span of years, place the
                        U.S. in great jeopardy. ’</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>29. A central aim of U.S. policy must be to deter the Communists from use of
                        their military power [while remaining prepared to fight general war should
                        one be forced upon the U.S.].<note n="‡‡" xml:id="d138fn-sym82">Proposed by

                            covered in par. 30 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi> [Footnote and brackets
                            in the source text.]</note> This stress on deterrence is dictated by the
                        disastrous character of total nuclear war, the possibility of local
                        conflicts developing into total war, and the serious effect of further
                        Communist aggression. Hence the Communist rulers must be convinced that
                        aggression will not serve their interests: that it will not pay.</p>
                    <p>30. If this purpose is to be achieved, the U.S. and its allies in the
                        aggregate will have to have, for an indefinite period, military forces with
                        sufficient strength, flexibility and mobility to enable them to deal swiftly
                        and severely with Communist overt aggression in its various forms and to
                        cope successfully with general war should it develop. In addition, the U.S.
                        and its major allies must show that they are united in their determination
                        to use military force against such aggression.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_815" n="815" facs="0845"/>
                    <p>31. As part of its military forces, the U.S. must develop and maintain its
                        effective nuclear-air retaliatory power, and must keep that power secure
                        from neutralization or from a Soviet knockout blow, even by surprise. So
                        long as the Soviets are uncertain of their ability to neutralize this power,
                        there is little reason to expect them to initiate general war or actions
                        which they believe would carry appreciable risk of general war, and thereby
                        endanger the regime and the security of the USSR.</p>
                    <p>32. In addition to its nuclear-air retaliatory power, the United States will
                        have to have other ready forces. These forces, together with those of its
                        allies, must be sufficient (a) to help deter any resort to local aggression,
                        or (b) to punish swiftly and severely any such local aggression, in a manner
                        and on a scale best calculated to avoid the hostilities broadening into
                        total nuclear war. Such ready forces will be in addition to those assigned
                        to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; must be suitably deployed, highly
                        mobile, and equipped as appropriate with atomic capability; and must also,
                        along with those assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, be
                        capable of discharging initial tasks in the event of general war.</p>
                    <p>33. Such a policy is predicated upon the support and cooperation of
                        appropriate major allies and certain other free world countries, in
                        furnishing bases for U.S. military power, especially strategic air, and in
                        providing their share of military forces. To succeed, the basic strategy and
                        policy of the U.S. must be believed by our appropriate major allies
                        generally to serve their security as well as ours. Thus, it is important for
                        the United States to take the necessary steps to convince them that such is
                        the case.</p>
                    <p>34. The ability to apply force selectively and flexibly will become
                        increasingly important in maintaining the morale and will of the free world
                        to resist aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United States
                        and its allies must never allow themselves to get into the position where
                        they must choose between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b)
                        applying force in a way which our own people or our allies would consider
                        entails undue risk of nuclear devastation. However, the United States cannot
                        afford to preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local
                        situation, if such use will bring the aggression to a swift and positive
                        cessation, and if, on a balance of political and military consideration,
                        such use will best advance U.S. security interests. In the last analysis, if
                        confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b)
                        taking measures risking either general war or loss of allied support, the
                        United States must be prepared to take these risks if necessary for its
                        security.</p>
                    <p>35. The United States and its allies must reject the concept of preventive
                        war or acts intended to provoke war. [The United States <pb xml:id="pg_816"
                            n="816" facs="0846"/>and its allies will also have to forego actions
                        regarded as provocative, if such actions would foreclose the requisite
                        domestic political support for the use of force should this become
                        necessary. Moreover, if the Communist rulers should conclude that the United
                        States is bent on aggressive war, they may feel that they have no choice but
                        to initiate war themselves at their own time. Hence, the United States
                        should attempt to make clear, by word and conduct, that it is not our
                        intention to provoke war.] <note n="§§" xml:id="d138fn-sym4">State proposal.
                            [Footnote and brackets in the source text.]</note> At the same time the
                        United States and its major allies must make clear their determination to
                        oppose aggression despite risk of general war, and the United States must
                        make clear its determination to prevail if general war eventuates.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Strengthening the Free World</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>36. The United States should place more stress than heretofore on building
                        the strength and cohesion of the free world, and take adequate actions for
                        the purpose of: (a) creating cohesion within and among all the free nations,
                        remedying their weaknesses, and steadily improving the relative position of
                        the free world; and (b) destroying the effectiveness of the Communist
                        apparatus in the free world. Success in these endeavors will depend heavily
                        on the degree to which the U.S. and its major allies can attain agreement on
                        basic political objectives and actions to achieve them.</p>
                    <p>37. Direct action against the Communist apparatus must rest largely with the
                        local governments concerned, although the US. should be able to help
                        significantly, chiefly through covert means. In countries vulnerable to
                        subversion, the U.S. should, as one of its objectives, assist in the
                        development of adequate internal security forces. In case of an imminent or
                        actual Communist seizure of control, the U.S. should take all feasible
                        political, economic, and covert measures to thwart it, and, if necessary and
                        appropriate, should take military action.</p>
                    <p>38. The existence of conditions in the free world which the Communists can
                        exploit makes it very difficult for the free world to overcome its
                        divisions, fears, and weaknesses. In many cases, the U.S. faces the choice
                        of (a) taking timely action to help remedy such conditions, or of (b)
                        allowing the situation to deteriorate with the prospect of later trying to
                        prevent Communist gains by more costly and less certain measures, or even
                        military action. The ability of the free world, over the long pull, to meet
                        the challenge and competition of the Communist world will depend in large
                        measure on the capacity to demonstrate progress toward meeting the basic
                        needs and aspirations of its peoples.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_817" n="817" facs="0847"/>
                    <p>39. In the economic field, there are two basic problems: (a) the
                        industrialized areas require expanding markets and (b) the underdeveloped
                        areas seek to develop and modernize their economies. It should be within the
                        capacity of the free world, with U.S. initiative and leadership, to turn
                        these two problems into mutually supporting assets for the promotion of
                        appropriate economic strength and growth.</p>
                    <p>40. A necessary condition for such strength and growth is a high level of
                        international trade within the free world. In order to foster this, the
                        U.S.: (a) should continue to press strongly for a general reduction of trade
                        barriers; (b) must take the lead by reducing further its own tariff level
                        over the next few years; and (c) should also support sound moves to widen
                        the convertibility of currencies.</p>
                    <p>41. The dangers of free world stability are particularly acute in the
                        underdeveloped areas. The task of speeding up their economic growth and
                        promoting stability presents a multitude of problems, political and social
                        as well as economic. For example, it calls for some changes in traditional
                        habits and attitudes and for greatly expanded training in administrative and
                        technical skills. In any case, new capital investment is a prerequisite to
                        growth. Local capital will have to be supplemented by the provision of
                        capital from abroad. In addition to external public and private investment
                        and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans, substantial financing from
                        U.S. public funds (including the Export-Import Bank) will be necessary, in
                        some cases over an extended period, to help achieve the economic progress
                        essential to U.S. interests. U.S. financial assistance alone cannot produce
                        satisfactory economic growth in these areas, and external assistance should
                        be used in a way to promote and not decrease local incentives and
                        self-help.</p>
                    <p>42. In order to promote conditions of sound development in underdeveloped
                        areas the United States should be prepared to use economic means available
                        to it where (a) such action serves U.S. objectives, (b) such development
                        cannot be financed by local or other foreign capital, and (c) such
                        assistance will be effectively used; and as part of such assistance the
                        United States should train indigenous leaders, develop skills, and provide
                        competent advisers. Specifically, the U.S. should support a new initiative,
                        in which industrialized free world nations and underdeveloped nations of
                        Asia would both participate, aimed at significant economic improvement in
                        South and Southeast Asia, where the Communist threat is especially
                        dangerous. [The total level of U.S. economic assistance worldwide should,
                        however, be progressively reduced.] <note n="║║" xml:id="d138fn-sym10"

                    <p>43. U.S. political policies must be adapted to conditions prevailing in each
                        underdeveloped area. The U.S. should not exert pressure to make active
                        allies of those not so inclined. The U.S. should provide assistance on the
                        basis of the willingness and ability of countries to strengthen and defend
                        their independence against Communist expansion rather than on their formal
                        alignment with the U.S. As far as possible, the U.S. should attempt to work
                        with rather than against those forces, such as constructive nationalist and
                        reform movements, which are likely to remain powerful over a long
                        period.</p>
                    <p>44. Where disputes and tensions between free nations threaten to impair free
                        world strength and cohesion, the U.S. should exert its best efforts to help
                        settle them or at least moderate their effects. In addition to efforts to
                        settle specific current controversies, the U.S. should develop longterm
                        policies to deal with deep-seated problems (such as those involved in the
                        evolution of colonial peoples).</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Political Strategy Against the Communist Bloc</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>45. The U.S. should develop a political strategy against the Communist bloc
                        designed: (a) to reduce the likelihood of aggression; (b) to influence, in
                        ways favorable to U.S. and free world interests, decisions and developments
                        within the Communist bloc, such as toward greater emphasis on internal
                        problems; and (c) to foster long-run trends which might lead to basic
                        changes in the outlook or character of Communist regimes.</p>
                    <p>46. In pursuing this strategy, the U.S. should seek: (a) to convince the
                        Communist regimes that alternatives exist to their present policies which
                        would be acceptable to the U.S., and which they might come to consider
                        compatible with their basic security interests; (b) to give to the Communist
                        regimes a clear conception of the true U.S. and free world purposes and
                        uncompromising determination to resist Communist aggressive moves; (c) to
                        exploit, in ways consistent with this strategy, differences within the
                        Soviet system or between the USSR and other members of the Communist
                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>47. The U.S. should be ready to negotiate with the USSR whenever it clearly
                        appears that U.S. security interests will be served thereby. The U.S. should
                        continue to take the initiative in advancing proposals for constructive
                        settlements and international cooperation (i.e., atoms for peace) in order
                        to put the Soviets on the defensive and win public support on both sides of
                        the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_819" n="819" facs="0849"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">State</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. Without relaxing its defense posture, the U.S. should actively use
                        negotiation in pursuing its strategy. By doing so, the U.S. would be in a
                        position (1) to expose the Communists’ “conciliatory” line and place on them
                        the onus for the persistence of tension and unsettled problems, or (2) to
                        force them to substantiate “peace” propaganda with action or compromises
                        beneficial to free world interests.</p>
                    <p>b. The U.S. should: (1) seek to settle specific problems, (such as Germany)
                        compatible with U.S. security, (2) seek to achieve a <hi rend="italic">modus
                            vivendi</hi> which would reduce world tensions and contribute to free
                        world security; (3) put forward and seek agreement on proposals which, if
                        accepted, would reduce the magnitude of the Soviet-Communist threat (such as
                        an acceptable plan for limitation of armaments with adequate
                        safeguards).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">

                        </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. For the most part, however, the U.S. must realize it will be not only
                        fruitless, but perhaps even hazardous, to continue its efforts to arrive at
                        solutions to world problems through the normal processes of negotiation with
                        the USSR.</p>
                    <p>b. If the USSR demonstrates a basic change of attitude which would be
                        conducive to achieving lasting settlements, the U.S. should then, and only
                        then, endeavor through stepped-up negotiations to arrive at agreements with
                        the USSR on the subjects of disarmament, atomic energy or other world
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>48. In applying this strategy to Communist China, the U.S. must take account
                        of non-recognition of the regime and the regime’s recent and continuing
                        aggressive policies. However, the U.S. should be ready to participate in
                        talks including Communist China on specific subjects on an <hi rend="italic"
                            >ad hoc</hi> basis, where the general objectives mentioned in connection
                        with negotiations with the USSR would be served thereby.</p>

                            Soviet atomic power, the determination of U.S. citizens to face the
                            risks involved in carrying out such national strategy will be of
                            increasing importance. Continuing efforts should be made to inform the
                            American people of the demands on their spiritual and material resources
                            necessary to ensure U.S. security during a <pb xml:id="pg_821" n="821"

                            protective measures should not be used to destroy national unity, which
                            must be based on freedom and not on fear.</item>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Defense—</hi>The President opened this subject by
                        commenting that only recently had the United States ever had to fear a
                        serious attack on its own lands—as a result of the long-range bomber. Hence
                        the Nation should focus its security efforts on retaliatory forces and on
                        continental defense as the means of counteracting that threat. He said we
                        must have a program that can be carried on indefinitely. The wisdom of such
                        an approach was strengthened by the fact that everything we can assess
                        indicates that Russia is not seeking general war; rather, she seems to feel
                        that economic and political subversion programs are going well and should be
                        pressed further. So we need a long term program of things that can deter or
                        dull any attack.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that he had directed, on his own judgment after
                        long study, a manpower reduction in the Army and those parts of the Navy not
                        involved in the deterrent or continental defense. Some of the reduction
                        would take place this year, and more next year. This was agreed in by most
                        people, but of course the land forces could always show a need for more and
                        more. However, there would be a new approach regarding reserve forces that
                        would serve as a back-up for the Army, particularly as any war could go into
                        more and more protracted phases after the first great attacks. The President
                        added specifically that the Army would be going down to 1.1 million men by
                        June 30, 1956, instead of the previously scheduled level of 1.175 million.
                        By June 30, 1957, it was hoped that the armed services altogether would
                        total something below 2.8 million. (The President soon left the meeting and
                        returned only after the lengthy <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                        presentation was completed.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Carter Burgess presented, with many charts, the new Reserve program,
                        answering numerous questions on detail along the way. The presentation and
                        discussion focused on the six-months training program, the quota to be set
                        by the President on the six-month program, the absence of any desire to
                        institute <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> military training at this time,
                        the need to have trained men other than those who have already served during
                        wartime, and the status of six-month trainees in later years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess then outlined <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> proposals for
                        the Career Incentive Program, including improvements as to medical care for
                        dependents, military housing, Survivor Benefits, Dislocation Allowance, <pb
                            xml:id="pg_824" n="824" facs="0854"/>and a pay increase which would <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> be across-the-board but would be designed to
                        retain people of longer service and to counteract the compression at higher
                        levels that had developed over the years.</p>
                    <p>(The President returned to the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> then sketched very
                        briefly the high spots of the defense programs that would be operated under
                        the request for about $34 billion of new appropriations. These included
                        continuing research and development at present high levels which require
                        about 50% of the Nation’s talent in this area; production at the same level
                        as before, but more allocated to weapons and ships with less to facilities;
                        reductions in maintenance and housekeeping; and the major problem for the
                        years ahead as a result of the high cost of the new type weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President took exception to the phrase “fringe benefits” with respect to
                        the several things Mr. Burgess had proposed, for these were in many ways the
                        heart of military service, more important really than base pay. The
                        President hoped these things would have very thorough consideration by the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Responding to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> pointed out that the ratio of combat soldiers to
                        non-combat was increasing; during World War II, about 42% of Army uniformed
                        personnel were combat troops, this was up to 52% in June of 1953, and the
                        target for 1955 was 62%.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SALTONSTALL1">Saltonstall</persName> asked if the
                        wings (137?) envisioned in the program would all be operational. The
                        President assured him they would be by the end of the year, for he would
                        have nothing to do with paper wings.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows the conclusion of the “Defense” portion of the meeting: a brief
                        discussion of possible publication of the so-called “Yalta Papers”, the

                        <hi rend="italic">National Defense—</hi>The President, speaking as
                        Commander-in-Chief, described the basic change in the military picture of
                        our times in terms of a “fear” having appeared for the first time in the
                        United States, since it was no longer immune from attack. By virtue of the
                        weakness of Germany and Japan, the traditional checks upon Russia had been
                        weakened and the United States now had a definite interest beyond its own
                        shores in the security of the industrial complexes of those two countries.
                        Also, the development of atomic weapons had put us on the front line. As a
                        result the United States needed economic programs that would help restore
                        Japan and Germany as strong defenders against Russia, allowing <pb
                            xml:id="pg_826" n="826" facs="0856"/>the United States to be a central
                        “keep”; also, the United States must have an effective deterring military
                        force and a strong civilian defense that could blunt any blow directed
                        against us.</p>
                    <p>The President then emphasized that security could not be measured in dollars,
                        rather the most important thing was maintaining a long and steady course.
                        This could be done through a well chosen, adequate and constantly modernized
                        defense organization, backed by the Reserve establishment and a strong
                        domestic economy. He believed that the possession of a strong retaliatory
                        power was the greatest service the United States could render even to Great
                        Britain and Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President set forth his belief in the need for increasing combat air up
                        to the level desired, having a carrier force to provide air power to meet
                        unexpected developments in any corner of the globe; and as a corollary to
                        cut back on manpower in the effort to achieve maximum security per dollar
                        expenditure. He stated that past requirements for US forces in Korea, Japan
                        and Europe left us now with larger contingents there than necessary.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>The improved Reserve would be needed as a well disciplined domestic
                        force.</p>
                    <p>While recognizing that a primary objective must be one of blunting the force
                        of an enemy attack during the first fifteen days so as to gain time for
                        American industrial superiority to have its effect, the President attached
                        great importance to having proper military strength to keep an enemy from
                        ever starting a war against us, knowing the destructiveness of modern
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President said that responsible leaders ought to be examining among
                        themselves every possible way to cut back manpower in the Services in places
                        other than air, Navy air, and submarine forces. The President stated that he
                        had worked on this problem before any other single thing, especially since
                        becoming President. He recognized that every Service could find good reason
                        for having increases in strength but he urged the need for getting the least
                        possible burden on the American people in a way that would not expose the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RAYBURN1">Rayburn</persName> was the first to
                        comment by making the same statement he recalled making a year ago—a hope
                        that “that big” is big enough. The President replied that there is a
                        progression from <pb xml:id="pg_827" n="827" facs="0857"/>things critically
                        needed, to those highly desirable, and then to those probably helpful—each
                        with decreasing returns.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HALLECKRCA1">Halleck</persName> interpreted the
                        President’s comments to mean simply having the proper balance in our Armed
                        Forces, plus a strong economy, a middle way between all-out mobilization and
                        weakness. The President added a comment that in some activities all the gold
                        in Fort Knox could take us no further ahead. He assured the group that he
                        would never be guilty consciously of exposing the United States
                        unnecessarily. Rather, he would always stand ready to discuss these matters
                        seriously since he did not profess to be any absolute authority.</p>
                    <p>(The President left the meeting during the following presentation.)</p>
                    <p>The new Reserve program was then presented, complete with charts, by Mr.
                        Burgess. On completion, Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SALTONSTALL1"
                            >Saltonstall</persName> ascertained that this program, with its
                        six-months training feature, did not in any way constitute universal
                        military training. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HALLECKRCA1"

                        asked a series of questions on detail, primarily as regards saving war
                        veterans from frequent recall to service.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Russell felt there would be no difficulty in getting sufficient people
                        to volunteer for the six-months program to fill the quota of 100, 000 set
                        for the first year. Mr. Burgess answered several questions on the mechanics
                        of the program for Sen. Russell<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">Sen. Richard

                        <note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">Sen. Carl Hayden (D., Ariz.).</note> was
                        interested in the total cost of the pay increases, Sen. <persName

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCNEILWJ1">McNeil</persName> then went over the
                        expenditures programmed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, which
                        would total about the same as for 1955 but would be devoted more to ships,

                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed a tentative draft statement of
                        policy titled “Basic National Security Policy” (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5440), prepared by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Planning Board for discussion by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at
                        its meeting on 21 December 1954. Due to the limited time available for study
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        request that their views which follow be considered as tentative and without
                        prejudice to any subsequent comments they may desire to submit.</p>
                    <p>2. In their memorandum to you dated 12 November 1954, subject: “Review of
                        Basic National Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2
                        and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/2),”<note n="3"

                            162/2, Oct. 30, 1953, and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5422/2,
                            Aug. 7, 1954, see pp. 577 and 715, respectively.</note> the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff expressed the view that the objective stated in paragraph 45 of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 remains valid, namely, “. . .
                        to create, prior to the achievement of mutual atomic plenty, conditions
                        under which the United States and the free world coalition are prepared to
                        meet the Soviet-Communist threat with resolution and to negotiate for its
                        alleviation under proper safeguards.” They also stated “It is believed
                        necessary to remove from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/ 2, its
                        present preponderant commitment to a policy of reaction with the purpose of
                        providing a basic U.S. security policy of unmistakably positive quality” and
                        that “it is imperative that our basic security policy, when revised, reflect
                        throughout the greater urgency of the present situation, define concretely
                        the conditions which it is the aim of our security policy to create, and
                        direct the formulation of courses of action designed to achieve the basic
                        objective.” None of these recommendations appear to have been incorporated
                        in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440.</p>
                    <p>3. As a general assessment of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440, the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that, while it appraises adequately the
                        gravity of the Soviet-Communist threat to the United States, it fails to (a)
                        state in clear, simple terms, the major objectives our policy is designed to
                        attain, (b) define concretely the conditions referred to in paragraph <pb
                            xml:id="pg_829" n="829" facs="0859"/>2 above, or (c) stress the urgent
                        need of achieving these conditions while the United States still holds a
                        marked superiority in the atomic field. Rather, the draft statement of
                        policy proposes as a general strategy (to be pursued in both the present era
                        of United States superiority and the coming era of atomic plenty) the
                        encouragement of tendencies that would lead the Communist Regimes to abandon
                        their expansionist policies (paragraph 26). The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        consider that, in the face of the basic and continuing hostility of the
                        Communist Regimes and of their recognized objectives as depicted in Section
                        A II of the paper, it would be illusory to expect that any overtures on the
                        part of the United States, consistent with United States security interests,
                        would be effective in ameliorating the danger now confronting us.</p>
                    <p>4. The following general comments are directed to those portions of the draft
                        basic policy considered to have military implications. More detailed
                        comments are contained in the Appendix hereto.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>a. <hi rend="italic">Section A.</hi> This section is considered to
                            constitute, in general, an acceptable estimate of the situation. There
                            is, however, a discernible tendency in Subsection II to underrate the
                            likelihood of Communist armed aggression particularly after the advent
                            of atomic plenty. Also, this Subsection overstresses the significance of
                            the present Soviet “soft” tactics as indicative of a possible basic
                            shift in the Soviet policy. The Soviets have recently demonstrated that
                            this “soft” tactic is subject to radical reversal whenever it suits
                            their interest.</item>
                        <item>b. <hi rend="italic">Section B.</hi> The national strategy set forth
                            in this section appears to be premised on the thesis that the solution
                            to the problem of United States security lies mainly in attempting to
                            bring about a reorientation of the Soviet Regimes through persuasion
                            leading to mutually acceptable settlements. If a policy of persuasion is
                            to be effective, the United States must either offer adequate
                            inducements or develop a position of sufficient strength to alter
                            radically the Soviet attitude. If the estimate of Soviet objectives set
                            forth in paragraph 14 of Section A is accepted as being reasonably
                            accurate, it is difficult to perceive how the United States can present
                            to the Communist Regimes alternatives which are in their basic interests
                            and do not conflict with the security interests of the United States.
                            The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion, therefore, that our
                            national strategy should recognize that, until the Communist Regimes are
                            convinced that their aggressive and expansionist policies will be met by
                            countermeasures which inherently will threaten the continued existence
                            of their regimes, it will not be feasible to induce a change in their
                            basic attitude or bring about the abandonment of their present
                            objectives, and that the desired conviction in Communist minds can be
                            brought about only through positive dynamic and timely action by the
                            United States.</item>
                        <item>c. <hi rend="italic">Section C.</hi> Subject to the detailed comments
                            in the Appendix hereto, Subsections I, IV, and V of this section are
                            considered to be generally acceptable. Subsection II should be expanded
                            to provide adequate guidance for future military assistance programs,
                            which <pb xml:id="pg_830" n="830" facs="0860"/>are important factors in
                            any United States undertaking to strengthen the Free World. Subsection
                            III develops the political aspects of the national strategy contained in

                            p. 394.</note>), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName>
                        referred to and summarized the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which had
                        been circulated the previous evening. While the views of the Joint Chiefs
                        were still tentative, they took exception to many portions of the proposed
                        new policy statement. In effect they were reaffirming the position that they
                        had taken at the meeting on November 24. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> then called for a general discussion of the report
                            (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440), and suggested that the
                        Secretary of State speak first.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
                        inasmuch as this meeting was preliminary in character, it would be best for
                        him to speak in general terms rather than to direct his remarks to specific
                        points in the policy report. He then indicated that he could not help but
                        have some sympathy for the general view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
                        favor of greater dynamism in the American attitude toward the Soviet Union
                        and Communist China. After all, during the course of the 1952 campaign he
                        had himself called for a more dynamic U.S. policy vis-à-vis Communism.
                        However, experience indicated that it was not easy to go very much beyond
                        the point that this Administration had reached in translating a dynamic
                        policy into courses of action, and in any case we had been more dynamic than
                        our predecessors.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then stated that
                        of course we have ruled out preventive war. In certain quarters it is
                        suggested, however, that while we continue to have atomic superiority over
                        the enemy, we should apply strong and forceful measures to change the basic
                        character of the Soviet system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said he assumed <pb xml:id="pg_834" n="834"
                            facs="0864"/>that this would call, in effect, for an effort to overthrow
                        the Communist regimes in China and in the European satellites and to detach
                        these countries from the USSR. In his opinion, continued Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, the effort to implement such a
                        course of action would involve the United States in general war. If it did
                        not, however, and we did succeed in detaching Communist China and the
                        satellites from their alliance with the Soviet Union, this in itself would
                        not actually touch the heart of the problem: Soviet atomic plenty. Even if
                        we split the Soviet bloc, in other words, we would still have to face the
                        terrible problem and threat of an unimpaired nuclear capability in the USSR
                        itself. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> did not think that this more dynamic and aggressive
                        policy would in fact achieve the desired goal unless it eventuated in a
                        general war which we could win. Moreover, while these more aggressive
                        policies, if successful, might result in the disintegration of the Soviet
                        bloc, they would almost certainly cause the disintegration of the free world
                        bloc, of which we were the leaders, for our allies in the free world would
                        never go along with such courses of action as these. In sum, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he must
                        conclude that this kind of aggressive policy was not in the best interests
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Another step which it had been suggested that the U.S. might take, would be
                        to present the USSR with an ultimatum to the effect that if the USSR
                        proceeded to try to take over any other free nation—such as Vietnam or
                        Finland—the United States would regard such an attempt as a <hi
                            rend="italic">casus belli.</hi> This was another case, said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, of a step which
                        might possibly succeed. But even if it did succeed, it would not touch the
                        heart of the problem of Soviet atomic capabilities, and would likewise prove
                        disastrous to the unity of the free world coalition. The remaining areas
                        into which the Soviets could expand their powers were not areas— except
                        perhaps in the case of the Middle East—whose acquisition would notably
                        increase the actual power of the Soviet bloc, although the prestige of the
                        latter might gain.</p>
                    <p>Basically, therefore, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, he felt our present national security policies were
                        pretty generally adequate, save, perhaps, in Asia and in the Middle East.
                        Our alliance system has staked out the vital areas of the world which we
                        propose to hold even at the risk of general war. These vital areas include
                        currently all the areas of immediate strategic value to us or which possess
                        significant war potential. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area is
                        by all odds the greatest single U.S. asset. Its defense is covered by our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treaty and by our interpretation
                        of that treaty in such fashion as to ensure a strong reaction to any Soviet
                        attempt at a take-over. We are thus committed to the denial of the <gloss

                    <p>Outside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, in Latin America we

                    <p>In the Pacific the vital areas are staked out by the Manila Pact or by other
                        treaties which commit the U.S. to defend the offshore island chain. One
                        critical gap in this area, which deserves our most careful consideration, is
                        Indonesia. In a way, Indonesia is a part of our great defensive arc in the
                        Pacific. It is of very great importance to us and to certain of our allies,
                        especially Japan. By and large, in sum, the situation in the Pacific is
                        pretty well in hand and buttressed by adequate policies, save in the case of
                        have concern, Southeast Asia, South Asia, India and Pakistan, etc., and the
                        Middle East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        pointed out that all these areas lie so close to the orbit of the USSR and
                        China, and all of the countries in question are so weak themselves, that
                        they cannot but pose very serious problems to us. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was not at all
                        optimistic about the future of Free Vietnam. Laos and Cambodia are also very
                        vulnerable. Yet if one looked at the other side of the picture, these
                        countries are not really of great significance to us, other than from the
                        point of view of prestige, except that they must be regarded as staging
                        grounds for further forward thrusts by the Communist powers. An example
                        would be Indonesia. Happily, the countries which are likely victims of such
                        a Communist forward thrust are covered by adequate defense arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, the South Asian countries were no real assets to the
                        United States in the military sense. It was different in the Middle East,
                        where the problem is greater, thanks to their oil resources. The Middle East
                        must be denied to the Soviet bloc, for the loss of this area to the free
                        world would be a matter of great gravity. So, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, he coupled the area of the
                        Middle East with Indonesia as representing a serious unsolved problem for
                        our national security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he
                        had talked about the problem of the Middle East with Foreign Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDENSA1">Eden</persName> in the course of his stay
                        in Paris. The British were thoroughly alarmed over evidences of Communist
                        infiltration into some of the Arab countries, and were jointly considering
                        with the United States how best to combat <pb xml:id="pg_836" n="836"
                            facs="0866"/>this infiltration. Equal difficulty was presented by
                        Indonesia, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        thought our policies vis-à-vis that country “inadequate”.</p>
                    <p>There was, of course, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, great concern at the prospect of future developments
                        in the strength of the Soviet bloc. We need not, however, be too
                        pessimistic. Time might well bring about many changes in the Communist bloc.
                        For example, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        believed that one could properly anticipate that there will be in the future
                        some disintegration of the present monolithic power structure of the Soviet
                        orbit. If conditions were so changed in the orbit that no single nation (the
                        Soviet Union) can decide upon and take sudden action without considering the
                        views of its allies and associates, the risk and threat posed by this single
                        nation would be greatly diminished. Nationalism, in short, may quite
                        conceivably grow apace among the satellites, and it was also logical, from
                        the historical point of view, to expect Communist China to reveal an
                        increasing attitude of independence vis-à-vis the USSR. Accordingly, it was
                        possible to foresee the growth within the Soviet bloc of so wide a
                        distribution of power that no single individual could decide on a course of
                        action which would bind all the rest. There was already some slight evidence
                        of such a development, and the United States may itself be able to promote
                        its further growth.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, therefore, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said that he felt that our policies were in the main
                        adequate to protect our national security. In any case, he could see no
                        clear substitutes for existing policies except in Indonesia, the Middle
                        East, and Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> also indicated again the desirability of
                        strengthening ourselves, from an organizational as opposed to a policy point
                        of view, in the field of action to cope with the subversion tactics of our
                        Communist enemies.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that if and when you should decide on a policy of
                        drawing a defensive line beyond which you tell the enemy he cannot step
                        without risking a clash, you automatically give the initiative to the enemy
                        to seize whatever falls short of the defensive line. For this reason he had
                        always rejected the concept of linedrawing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> to make any
                        general comments he might wish.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> at first
                        said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> had
                        stated his own thoughts better than he could. However, he said he did desire
                        to emphasize one or two points made by the Secretary of State, particularly
                        with respect to the timing of our courses of action and with respect to the
                        areas which we select for concentrating our activities. Preventive war, said
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, was <pb
                            xml:id="pg_837" n="837" facs="0867"/>obviously out. Moreover, an
                        aggressive course of action to roll back Communism was also out. We would
                        lose our allies, and such a course of action was not worth the risks it
                        entailed. These two decisions plainly settle our course of action in a
                        number of areas in the world, such as Quemoy and Indochina. If there was to
                        be no aggressive roll-back of the enemy, the United States must be very
                        careful never again to let itself get into situations where we do not really
                        plan to defend our interests. In short, if we know we are not going to
                        embrace a policy of rolling back the enemy, we should withdraw from those
                        positions in the world which we do not propose to defend by military
                        action.</p>
                    <p>If we adopt such a policy as he was suggesting, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said we would be in effect
                        practicing a policy of co-existence. The United States must, in other words,
                        now learn to live the way many of the other nations of the world have lived
                        for many centuries—that is, by co-existence based on the maintenance of the
                        balance of power. The United States must participate in a world division of
                        power so carefully balanced that neither side dares to “jump” the other. For
                        these reasons we should avoid provocative actions vis-à-vis the USSR and not
                        get ourselves into positions which are untenable from the point of view of
                        their defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, continued
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>, had
                        indicated in his statement the three major areas of the world in which the
                        United States should be prepared to spend its resources and to fight if
                        necessary, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> added that he did not believe that there were any
                        other such areas. Quemoy and Indochina were certainly not among the areas
                        for which we would fight, and, indeed, he doubted if we should really fight
                        anywhere on the Asian continent. Instead, we should devote our resources to
                        those areas where we decide in advance that it is essential for us to be
                        strong. We can’t do everything for everybody at the same time. Accordingly,
                        we should pick out the key areas and intensify our action there, and not
                        spend our time and resources anywhere else. If we adopted some such basic
                        principle as this, the details with which we are constantly confronted, in
                        trying to determine our military and economic setup, would settle
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>South America, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, the Middle East, and Japan should be strengthened,
                        along with Western Europe, including North Africa. He would much prefer to
                        strengthen our position in the Middle East than to bolster up India. The
                        same rule applied to Japan and Indonesia. If we are to adopt a policy of
                        building up these areas, instead of constantly trying to kick Russia in the
                        shins, then Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        thought we must begin realistically to look at our trade policies with the
                        Soviet bloc nations. It was absolutely essential to have more such trade,
                        both for our allies <pb xml:id="pg_838" n="838" facs="0868"/>and for
                        ourselves. After all, nearly every article of trade between nations has in
                        some sense a usefulness in war. While he did not propose, of course, to send
                        aircraft and weapons to the Soviet bloc, he favored a general expansion of
                        trade in other kinds of commodities.</p>
                    <p>As for Latin America, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, the United States should make it absolutely clear
                        that we will not tolerate Communism anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. We
                        should therefore stop talking so much about democracy, and make it clear
                        that we are quite willing to support dictatorships of the right if their
                        policies are pro-American.</p>
                    <p>The President interrupted to say, you mean they’re OK if they’re <hi
                            rend="italic">our</hi> s.o.b.’s.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                        was it, and went on to point out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were at
                        least correct in accusing the United States of being much too idealistic in
                        its relations with other nations. Whatever we may choose to say in public
                        about ideals and idealism, among ourselves we’ve got to be a great deal more
                        practical and materialistic.</p>
                    <p>Finally, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, he was not in the least afraid of co-existence.
                        Our American system was sufficiently strong to undertake such a policy, and
                        in competition with the Soviet Union we could certainly beat them.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated disagreement with a number of points made by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>. He pointed
                        out that India contained a population of 350 million, among which was a lot
                        of very good military material. If we were to let this whole South Asian
                        subcontinent fall into the hands of the Communists, we must almost certainly
                        lose the Middle East as well. This was a certain invitation to general war.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied
                        that even so, we could not defend everybody everywhere. We must choose
                        between whether we defend Iran or India. The President answered in turn that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> was calling
                        in effect for a situation which would necessitate resort to preventive war.
                        The domination of India by the USSR would be certain to cost us the entire
                        Middle East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> answered that he had not argued that adoption of
                        his views would outlaw war forever, but if his views were adopted there was
                        a chance of peace lasting for a good many years.</p>
                    <p>The President then inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> why Indonesia seemed so much more important to him
                        than India. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                        answered that he felt so because Indonesia protected our whole Pacific
                        position and was therefore worth holding and fighting for.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="pg_839" n="839" facs="0869"/>
                    <p>The President then charged Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> with arguing that except for certain important
                        nations and areas, he was willing to let the whole rest of the free world go
                        by the board. But each time, said the President, that the Soviet Union takes
                        over an additional free country, the rate of the process accelerates.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied
                        that since we will eventually get pushed out of certain areas, would we not
                        be better off if we withdrew from places like Indochina before we were
                        actually pushed out? It was likewise better to get Chiang Kai-shek to
                        withdraw from Quemoy and the other offshore islands before he too was pushed
                        out.</p>
                    <p>With a smile, the President invited Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> to “take on” Chiang
                        Kai-shek, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> reiterated his position that he wanted to know
                        where he was going to be and where he was going to take his stand, in order
                        that he could be just as strongly entrenched as possible in that area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> for an
                        expression of his views.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that he
                        personally subscribed to the view that the threat posed to the U.S. by the
                        USSR had not lessened, though he believed that the threat of global war had
                        lessened. Starting from this point, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said he was much impressed by
                        the historical fact that our country had enjoyed great prestige throughout
                        the world in past generations when we had actually possessed very little
                        real military power. Certainly, he added, we cannot counter the Soviet
                        threat by borrowing Soviet methods. It was much wiser to use our own
                        methods. He said that he did not think we should announce any line which, if
                        crossed by the Soviets, would bring on war with the United States. On the
                        other hand, we would be wise ourselves to consider carefully those areas
                        where we can and should make our stand. The continent of Asia has never been
                        an area that the European powers could conquer. Hence he was, for lack of a
                        better word, in favor of containment. We were in a position to hold on to
                        the island chain, to the peninsulas of Korea, India and Malaya. We should
                        therefore draw both a military and an economic line including these areas.
                        We should also try to take the heat off certain hot spots such as was
                        currently provided by the Nationalist-held offshore islands. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that he did not
                        agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1"
                        >Humphrey</persName>’s position on India. Every effort should be made to
                        hold that country. But we must get away from the old colonial approach, both
                        in Africa and in the Middle East. This was the kind of line which the United
                        States should draw.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to aiding these countries economically, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said, he was at least in favor
                        of a policy of helping them to help themselves. We must also have sufficient
                        military strength in <pb xml:id="pg_840" n="840" facs="0870"/>these areas to
                        assure their internal security, although we should not build up their
                        military forces to a point which would permit them to indulge in any
                        external aggression.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> then stated that
                        all of us are, of course, conditioned by our own experience. While his was
                        rather limited in international affairs, he had nevertheless had some
                        experience which was useful. Plainly, we must live for the time being with
                        Communism. While we ourselves can’t do very much externally to destroy it,
                        he was sure that ultimately it would destroy itself. The same applied in a
                        slightly different way to China. China had been a dictatorship for
                        centuries; so had the Soviet Union. These countries had new kinds of
                        dictators now, but these dictators still faced the problem of how to control
                        their population.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that he did
                        not like the word “coexistence” much better than he liked the word
                        “containment”, but coexistence was at least better than cohabitation. Basing
                        his judgment on past experiences in dealing with the big labor unions,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> said that the
                        only formula that worked was a formula which called for admitting your own
                        mistakes. Our policy should be strong, but we could no more bully the Soviet
                        Union than we could bully the labor unions. We should, accordingly, deal
                        with the Soviet Union from strength and in the confidence that our own
                        system was much the better, instead of adopting courses of action in
                        imitation of Soviet methods. With respect to trade with the Soviet bloc,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName> was sure that
                        progress could be made if once again we could take the heat off of some of
                        the hot spots. Our best course of action in this area was to return to our
                        traditional open-door policy on the basis of the President’s concept of net
                        advantage. We should not, however, offer credits to the USSR or to Communist
                        China in order to stimulate trade.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2">Wilson</persName>
                        recommended that, once the Council had agreed on a broad new statement of
                        basic policy, we should list the concrete problems which face our country
                        and determine specific courses of action to solve them. That was his broad
                        look at the current picture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> then called on General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWININGGNF1">Twining</persName> who, however, said
                        that he had nothing in particular to add to the written comments of the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="8" xml:id="d142fn8">Reference is to the
                            memorandum by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to <persName>Wilson</persName>,
                            Dec. 17, <ref target="#pg_828">p. 828</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President commented that, as so often, we had again gone around in a
                        circle and come back to the same place. The problem of the Soviet Union was
                        a new kind of problem, and the old rules simply didn’t apply to our present
                        situation. As regards the proposal <pb xml:id="pg_841" n="841" facs="0871"
                        />to take the heat off the hot spots and to remove irritations in our
                        dealings with the Soviet Union, the President pointed out that every
                        locality in the world is a source of irritation if you are dealing with
                        Communists. There would be no chance whatever of removing irritations unless
                        we were prepared to get off the earth. Our attitude with respect to the
                        offshore islands, said the President, seemed to him perfectly OK. Chiang
                        Kai-shek had been made to realize that we would not go to war over these
                        islands. On the other hand, the President could see no reason why we should
                        press Chiang to get out of the offshore islands. If he were to do so,
                        moreover, the center of Communist irritation would be transferred from the
                        offshore islands to Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that while he could go along with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> in agreeing that we should
                        not make binding treaties with the nations of South Asia, he certainly could
                        not agree with him that we should let this whole vast area fall into the
                        Communist orbit. There was certainly a good deal of help which the U.S.
                        could provide to these nations. A couple of billions would not be wasted on
                        them if we consider the size of our total defense budget. While, the
                        President said, he did not propose to make the United States an Atlas,
                        bearing the weight of the world, there was still much that we could do. The
                        President concluded by noting with alarm the proposal made by the President
                        of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for a 25% cut in all Government expenses,
                        including expenditures for defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> noted that
                        in his travels in Europe he had everywhere observed the same spirit of
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> said that with
                        regard to the question of U.S. assistance to foreign nations, we should
                        recognize that there is tenable ground in between military commitment to
                        save these nations from Communism and total abandonment of the areas to
                        Communism. The verdict of history was that the Soviet leaders had been
                        rather cautious in exercising their power. They were not reckless, as Hitler
                        was; but primarily they rely not on military force but on methods of
                        subversion. This was natural, because the Communist Party was in essence
                        revolutionary and conspiratorial. At the present time they calculate that it
                        is not worth their while to undermine the successful campaign of subversion
                        by indulgence in actions of open brutality. This deterrent is not
                        constituted by our military power, but is based on Soviet reluctance to
                        indulge in actions of aggression which cannot be reconciled with their
                        worldwide propaganda line in favor of peace and co-existence. Hence, if
                        areas exposed to the Communist threat can build up governments capable of
                        maintaining internal security and governments which can’t be overthrown
                        except by overt, brutal acts of aggression, it <pb xml:id="pg_842" n="842"
                            facs="0872"/>will be possible to withstand the present Soviet threat.
                        Accordingly, it will be very much worth our while to provide to these
                        vulnerable nations sufficient military and economic assistance as will
                        enable them to provide for their internal security and for the bettering of
                        their economic health. The situation in Vietnam, warned Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName>, was not a typical case but a
                        special case, and we should not generalize on the basis of Vietnam, where
                        the French had messed up the situation so thoroughly.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HUMPHREYGM1">Humphrey</persName> interrupted
                        to say that in any case let us not get ourselves again into such a situation
                        as we found ourselves in in Vietnam and from which we ought to get out as
                        quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> then went on to
                        point out that the value of our programs of economic assistance ought not to
                        be exaggerated. The maintenance of adequate security forces in these
                        vulnerable countries was equally important.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1">Stassen</persName> said it seemed
                        to him that the Council was in agreement on two facts of central
                        priority—the fact of Soviet power on the one hand, and the cohesion of our
                        allies on the other. Our total national security policies should,
                        accordingly, stress both centers of strength, our own confidence and our
                        sustained power. If we manage to do this we will ultimately weaken the
                        enemy’s confidence in himself. When that happened, the internal opposition
                        to Communist control will grow stronger as the peoples of these states lose
                        confidence in the success of their system against ours. Conversely, holding
                        our friends together likewise requires an atmosphere of confidence and
                        success. That was why, continued Governor <persName corresp="#p_STASSENHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName>, he thought we must not let ourselves get into a
                        position where we seem to be backing away from the challenge. If we backed
                        away from South Asia, the effects would not only be bad in Japan, but in
                        Europe as well. Accordingly, he agreed with the position of the Secretary of
                        State on these areas. We don’t need to give South Asia top priority in our
                        assistance programs, but we certainly don’t need to refuse all assistance.
                        Moreover, we will not need, from now on, to spend so much in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that it was good to have such frank discussion, but
                        he did not believe that the practical differences between the members of the
                        Council were very great. It all came down to the kind of help that the
                        United States can provide in order to prevent Communist take-overs through
                        tactics of subversion. Certainly, however, we could not afford to lose such
                        great areas as India. It is in trying to formulate theoretical policy that
                        we encounter such great apparent disagreements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1">Cutler</persName> said that while this
                        general discussion had been very useful, he hoped that he could ask the
                        Council for guidance on one <pb xml:id="pg_843" n="843" facs="0873"
                        />specific issue which had caused great concern to the Planning Board. The
                        issue was set forth in paragraph 47 of the basic policy paper, and concerned
                        the attitude that the United States should take with respect to negotiations
                        with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were very skeptical of U.S.
                        negotiations with the Soviet Union unless the USSR demonstrated a basic
                        change of attitude which would be conducive to achieving lasting
                        settlements. The State Department, on the other hand, believed that we
                        should actively use negotiation in pursuing our strategy, although we should
                        do so without relaxing our defense posture.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired if
                        there was not general acceptance at least of the first two sentences of
                        paragraph 47, which read as follows: “The U.S. should be ready to negotiate
                        with the USSR whenever it clearly appears that U.S. security interests will
                        be served thereby. The U.S. should continue to take the initiative in
                        advancing proposals for constructive settlements and international
                        cooperation (i.e., atoms for peace) in order to put the Soviets on the
                        defensive and win public support on both sides of the Iron Curtain.” If
                        everybody could agree to these two sentences, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DULLESJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested stopping the
                        paragraph at that point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CUTLERR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> indicated that this was exactly what the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff proposed in their views. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WILSONCE2"
                            >Wilson</persName> proposed adoption of the first sentence of paragraph
                        47, with the addition of the phrase “in order to advance the cause of world
                        peace.” The rest of the paragraph he likewise thought could be deleted,
                        including the split view.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLEMMINGAS1">Flemming</persName> suggested that
                        courses of action involving negotiation should be based on the best
                        available intelligence estimate of what is going on in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the trouble was that we were trying to establish
                        policies in this paper designed to deal with situations which could really
                        only be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. We must always be on the alert
                        for changes and opportunities. The argument of the Defense Department that
                        entering into negotiations with the Soviet Union would cause the free world
                        to let down its military guard seemed to be based on the assumption that the
                        State Department was incapable of distinguishing fraudulent from honest
                        changes in the Soviet attitude. Moreover, said the President, we cannot hope
                        to get the continued support of public opinion in the free world if we
                        always say “no” to any suggestions that we negotiate with the Soviet Union.
                        Accordingly, we should negotiate wherever and whenever it looks profitable.
                        The first two sentences of paragraph 47, said the President, seemed
                        sufficient to him.</p>
