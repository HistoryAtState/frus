                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                    Government. The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the
                    responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of
                    Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans, researches, compiles,
                    and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first
                    promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection
                    and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These regulations,
                    with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                        >U.S.</gloss> foreign policy decisions and significant <gloss
                        target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series
                    should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                        >U.S.</gloss> Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles
                    established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy;
                    records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the
                    published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit
                    no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded. The editors are
                    convinced that this volume meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major <gloss

                    requires that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the <gloss

                    cooperate with the Department of State historians by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the
                    preparation of this volume have been declassified and are available for review
                    at the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II), in College
                    Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files ("lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration facility in College Park, Maryland (Archives
                    II), and may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool.
                    Almost all of the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period,
                    which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been
                    transferred to or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s
                    custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> Presidential Library and other
                    agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been declassified,
                    some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff of the Carter
                    Library is processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this
                    volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time of
                    publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Carter Library
                    include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related documentation from
                    White House offices, the Department of State, and other federal agencies
                    including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administrations’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still classified records held in various Presidential
                    Libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attach<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>ments to a
                    given document were in fact attached to the paper copy of the document in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated the ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were "Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>Documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to Washington
                    time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling or provide emphasis are silently
                    corrected. Words and phrases underlined in the source text are printed in
                    italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original
                    text, and a list of abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of
                    each volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators
                    such as Secto) is printed at the start of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and the number of pages not declassified in their chronological
                    place. All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in
                    the footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory Committee does
                    not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it
                    makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes
                    as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government, and
                    the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments. The declassification review of this volume, which began in 2014 and
                    was completed in 2015 resulted in the decision to withhold 2 documents in full,
                    excise a paragraph or more in 2 documents, and make minor excisions of less than
                    a paragraph in 14 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and edito<pb n="VII" facs="0008"

                <p>This volume focuses on the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s efforts to negotiate, sign, ratify, and implement new Panama
                    Canal treaties. The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration inherited the Panama Canal treaties re-negotiation issue after 13
                    years of off-and-on-again negotiations, and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName> made it a top foreign policy priority when he took office
                    in January 1977. The volume traces the administration’s commitment to achieving
                    what proved to be an unpopular, challenging, but ultimately successful foreign
                    policy objective.</p>
                <p>Documents selected for this volume highlight the high-level decision-making on
                    this issue within the White House, Department of State, and Department of
                    Defense and demonstrate how personally committed President <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was to concluding new treaties. Even
                        <pb n="X" facs="0011" xml:id="pg_X"/>though the negotiation of new treaties
                    and the concept of turning the canal over to Panamanian control proved to be
                    politically unpopular, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> remained
                    invested and highly involved in the issue from beginning to end, even as he
                    recognized the political capital required to succeed. </p>
                <p>Obstacles the administration faced to successfully concluding new treaties
                    included having them ratified by the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                    Congress, which, along with the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> public,
                    remained largely opposed to negotiating a new treaty with Panama. The
                    documentation covers the executive branch’s rigorous public relations campaigns
                    to win ratification votes in the Senate; the administration’s outreach
                    strategies to win over the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> people; attempts
                    by members of Congress to defeat the treaties during the ratification process;
                    and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration officials’ and
                        <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> diplomats’ efforts to assuage the
                    concerns and frustration of the Panamanian leadership, often expressed by its
                    leader <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Omar Torrijos</persName> as the ratification
                    fight unfolded. </p>
                <p>This volume also documents the decision-making that drove the administration’s
                    approach to the legislation required to implement the treaties once they were
                    ratified and the negotiations with those marshalling it through Congress.
                    Day-to-day implementation of the treaties in Panama, overseen mainly by the
                    Department of Defense, is not covered in this volume. In addition to the
                    documentation concerning the treaties, the volume includes coverage of other
                    significant bilateral issues and the expressed desire of leaders from both
                    nations to move their relationship beyond the canal. These bilateral issues
                    included <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> attempts to influence Panamanian
                    involvement in the affairs of other Central American nations, particularly
                    Nicaragua and El Salvador, and Panama’s hosting of the Shah of Iran in the
                    winter of 1979–1980 at the request of the United States.</p>

                <p>The records of the White House, the Department of State, and the Department of
                    Defense provided the bulk of the key documentation for this volume. The Carter
                    Presidential Library in Atlanta, Georgia, is the best source of high-level
                    decision-making on the administration’s policies toward Panama. The Library’s
                    National Security Adviser files contain a number of important collections. In
                    particular, the State Evening Reports from Secretary of State <persName

                    Subject File, contain some of the best records of <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName>’s handwritten thoughts and decision-making on the Panama
                    Canal Treaties issue. The Brzezinski Material Trip File holds a wealth of
                    important memoranda from National Security Adviser <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                        >Brzezinski</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and

                    interagency officials. The President’s Correspondence with Foreign Leaders File
                    in the Brzezinksi Material provided critical correspondence between <persName

                    addition to other records. The Brzezinski Material Country File and the

                        >Hamilton Jordan</persName>’s Files provided key documents on a range of

                    Administration facility in College Park, Maryland, and at the Department of
                    State, provided essential materials for this volume. The Official and Personal
                    Files of Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth
                        Bunker</persName> (Lot 78D300) contain the richest source of key documents
                    on negotiating the treaties with Panama, including transcripts and summaries of
                    negotiations, important memoranda of conversation, and strategizing documents.
                    The files of Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs <persName
                        corresp="#p_AJB_2">J. Brian Atwood</persName> (Lot 81D115) proved to be
                    useful for doc<pb n="XVI" facs="0017" xml:id="pg_XVI"/>umenting public and
                    congressional outreach efforts. Files from American Embassy Panama were helpful,
                    particularly the Panama Canal Treaty Negotiation Files, 1964–1977 (Lot 81F1) for
                    providing important memoranda of conversation, telegrams, transcripts and other
                    documents related to the 1977 negotiations. The files of Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName> and Deputy Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> provided select
                    documents, and the records of David P. Newsom, Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, 1978–1981 (Lot 81D154) were the main source of documents on the Shah of
                    Iran’s stay in Panama. The Department’s Central Foreign Policy File contained
                    useful telegrams.</p>
                <p>The Department of Defense played a central role in the <persName

                    Panama, and the documents selected for this volume provide an essential
                    high-level Department of Defense perspective. The key collections mainly came
                    from Record Group 330, Records of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, held
                    at the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland. The <gloss

                            “would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama
                            Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians . . .
                            I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama
                            Canal Zone with Panama. I would be willing to continue to raise the
                            payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone. I might
                            even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in
                            the Panama Canal Zone, but I would not relinquish practical control of
                            the Panama Canal Zone in the foreseeable future.” <persName

                            must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. The United
                            States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal, and the
                            United States will maintain our national security interests in the
                            Panama Canal. The negotiations for the Panama Canal started under
                            President Johnson and have continued up to the present time. I believe
                            those negotiations should continue. But there are certain guidelines
                            that must be followed, and I’ve just defined them.” (<hi rend="italic"

                            committed as a result of the negotiations to date. To move backward
                            would be viewed by many as reneging on our commitments and would run the
                            risk of conflict. Accordingly, I believe that the new Administration
                            should not interfere in the negotiations which will be going on between
                            now and the change of administration, but should keep itself closely
                            informed. Thereafter, the new Administration must face up to completing

                        <p>Our basic national interest in Panama is that the Canal remain efficient,
                            secure, neutral, and continuously open to all world shipping at
                            reasonable tolls. The present Canal has served us well over the years,
                            and is still a “major” defense asset which enhances <gloss

                        <p>While its near-term economic value may be enhanced by the requirement to
                            transport Alaskan oil to the Gulf Coast, it is now an aging utility of
                            declining commercial value. Of total tonnage that transits the Canal,
                            about 44% originates in, and 22% is destined for, <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> ports. These figures represent 16% of
                            total <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> export and import tonnage.
                            More than 30% of Panama’s foreign exchange earnings and 13% of its
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> are attributed to the presence
                            of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>Alternatives to the Canal have emerged—use of super tankers, land bridge,
                            pipelines. After 63 years of operation, the Canal’s strategic
                            significance has diminished, while its potential as a source of conflict
                            has increased. Moreover, it is the intelligence community’s estimate
                            that while delay in a treaty invites violence against the Canal, it
                            would also endanger <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>’

                        </p>
                        <p>Our central objective over the past 12 years has been to protect our
                            national interest by negotiating a new treaty with Panama that would
                            eliminate what have been viewed as anachronistic “colonial” aspects of
                            our presence in Panama without endangering the continuing operation,
                            safety and availability of the Canal. Any agreement must be acceptable
                            to Panama, the Congress, the Federal agencies involved and the American
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Our negotiators believe that we can, with continued effort, shortly be
                            within reach of a treaty with Panama that will meet these requirements,
                            provided that both sides are willing to make compromises on certain
                            issues. Though we differ over questions related to the exercise of
                            sovereignty, particularly over the nature and duration of the United
                            States defense role, Panama’s national interest in an open, efficient
                            and safe canal is similar to ours. The <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> Government is—in comparison to any successor
                            government conceivable now—one from which we can get more of what we
                            want and one with which we have the best chance of negotiating a lasting
                            treaty (National Intelligence Estimate [<gloss target="#t_NIE_1"

                        <p>Much progress has been made since 1974 including agreement to cede legal
                            jurisdiction over the present Canal Zone to Panama and to increase
                            Panamanian participation in the operation of the Canal while retaining a
                            primary <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> operation and defense role.
                            The negotiations have, however, been essentially stalled since February
                            1976. The major issues that remain to be resolved include treaty
                            duration (which is particularly important to Panama), and post-treaty
                            defense rights and neutrality (which are particularly important to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>). Other politically sensitive
                            issues include employee benefits (which affect some 3,800 <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen employees) and United States
                            use of the lands and waters of the Canal Zone during the treaty period
                            on which positive movement has been made during the past year on an
                            informal and “what if” basis.</p>
                        <p>Once our negotiators reach agreement in principle on the main treaty
                            issues, they can begin to draft the actual treaty—a process that has not
                            yet commenced.</p>
                        <p>It should be emphasized that domestic politics in both countries have
                            added greatly to the numerous problems inherent in this complex
                            negotiation; they affect—sometimes unpredictably—many individual issues,
                            as well as the pace and conduct of the negotiations and their public
                            presentation in both Panama and the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            (Tab 4, Major Forces Involved).<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Tab 4 is

                        </p>
                        <p>The negotiation of a new Canal treaty, moreover, is not a purely
                            bilateral issue. Panama has elicited broad expressions of support from
                            individual countries, the United Nations, the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> and in the non-aligned movement of developing
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>While Panama probably overemphasizes the value of international support
                            at the negotiating table, a breakdown of the negotiations would gravely
                            burden our policies throughout this Hemisphere, where the talks are
                            generally viewed as a practical test of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> credibility. Conversely, to many Latin American
                            countries the Canal is even more important commercially than it is to
                            the United States. Those countries are supportive of a Canal treaty that
                            will insure continuous effective operation and defense of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the successful conclusion of a new treaty that would protect our
                            basic national interests in the Canal would do more than remove a source
                            of tension and potential bloodshed: it would strengthen the reputation
                            of the United States as a force for creative world leadership.</p>

                                voted on a draft resolution sponsored by Panama and Peru, which,

                            <p>—Threshold Agreement on Protection and Defense of the Canal. This
                                would give the United States primary responsibility for the
                                protection and defense of the Canal during the lifetime of the
                                treaty. Panama would participate in Canal protection. Panama and the
                                United States would retain unilateral rights to take action
                                necessary to protect and defend the Canal. Both parties committed
                                themselves to maintain the permanent neutrality of the waterway.</p>
                            <p>—Threshold Agreement on Increasing Panamanian Participation in the
                                Administration of the Canal. Panama agreed that the United States
                                would have the primary responsibility for the operation of the Canal
                                during the term of the treaty. Panamanian citizens would have
                                growing participation in all levels of employment and in the
                                formulation of overall policy concerning Canal operation.</p>
                            <p>—Threshold Agreement on Jurisdiction and Rights of Use. It was agreed
                                that jurisdiction over the Canal Zone would return to Panama during
                                a three-year transition period. Panama would confer upon the United
                                States, the use of the areas which are necessary for the specific
                                purposes of the operation, maintenance, protection and defense of
                                the Canal. The specific lands and waters areas would be determined

                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Duration</hi>. Panama believes this to be the key
                                remaining issue. It has consistently, vigorously and publicly
                                maintained that December 31, 1999, is the latest possible date for
                                treaty termination. Its position <pb n="9" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_9"
                                />appears fixed. The United States agreed basically with that date
                                only as it applies to the termination of United States control over
                                Canal operation. As provided in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                                    >NSDM</gloss> 302, we have insisted on a 40-year duration for
                                United States defense rights (Paragraph B, Tab 9).</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Neutrality Guarantees and Post-Treaty Defense
                                    Arrangements</hi>. We have proposed that Panama and the United
                                States guarantee the neutrality of the Canal jointly and that there
                                be a post-treaty agreement on joint defense. Panama agrees in
                                principle that the Canal should be permanently open on a
                                nondiscriminatory basis to all world shipping. Panama, sensitive to
                                the “perpetuity” implications of this formula, wants <gloss

                                neutrality after the treaty’s termination (Paragraphs C and D, Tab

                            <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Options on Major Issues</p>
                        <p>Duration, neutrality and post-treaty arrangements are closely related and
                            are the major issues in the negotiations. This inter-relationship makes
                            these issues somewhat complex but also offers opportunities for
                            negotiation of compromise formulas that will meet essential United
                            States security interests while being consistent with Panamanian
                            concerns and domestic pressures. It is important to keep in mind that on
                            these issues tradeoffs which are mutually perceived to protect each
                            party’s basic interests could provide the basis for a final
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Panama has flatly rejected the duration position (December 31, 1999, for
                            operation and 40 years for defense) presented by the United States
                            negotiators. Informally, the Panamanian negotiators have emphasized,
                            however, that if we could terminate both operation and defense rights
                            (including military presence) by 2000, it could then be “flexible”
                            concerning new arrangements for protecting United States security
                            interests beyond the year 2000. Panama has not offered a formula for
                            such arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Our options on the duration for <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            control of Canal operation are: (1) hold with 1999; (2) go to 20 years
                            as provided in existing guidance; or (3) choose some slightly earlier
                            date (Tab 9A, Discussion).</p>
                        <p>On duration for defense, we can hold at 40 years with several sub-options
                            or choose a shorter period down to the year 2000.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="0045" xml:id="pg_10"/>
                        <p>Panama’s willingness to accept a given period for duration of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> defense rights under a new treaty is
                            contingent at least in part on the type of military presence or rights
                            which the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> would be authorized to
                            maintain after Panama assumes full control of the Canal’s operation. The
                            options that may be acceptable from the point of view of our defense
                            needs range from (a) a full military presence such as we now maintain to
                            (b) a token presence for the purpose of maintaining a logistics base to
                            (c) no presence but a right to return to protect the Canal. There has
                            been no decision within the Government on whether it is necessary to
                            keep troops and bases in Panama after our operation rights terminate in
                            order to protect <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> security interests
                            (Tab 9B, Discussion). The uniformed services have not yet identified the
                            level of residual military presence or the type of formal arrangements
                            with Panama necessary to reasonably assure the Canal’s defense in the
                            post-treaty period.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the closely related questions of neutrality and post-treaty
                            arrangements, Defense and State agree that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> wants solid assurance (after our operational rights
                            terminate) that the Canal will be kept open permanently and on a
                            nondiscriminatory basis to world shipping and to <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military and commercial vessels.</p>
                        <p>The two Departments also agree that we could further the objective of
                            assuring access by inserting a clause in the neutrality agreement
                            guaranteeing that the waterway will be open on a nondiscriminatory basis
                            to ships of all nations—a provision to which Panama has not objected.
                            The issue is what states should be the guarantors and what provisions if
                            any need to be included to make that abstract neutrality effective.</p>
                        <p>There is general Defense agreement that several options are open for
                            attaining the guarantee of neutrality and to make clear that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interest in the Canal is not
                            diminished. One way to achieve this objective would be to provide for a
                            continuing right for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to take
                            such action unilaterally in Panama after the year 2000 as the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> (by itself) determined was necessary
                            to protect our interests in the Canal. (This was the formal Defense
                            position under the prior Administration.) Another way of meeting this
                            objective—which is also consistent with the Defense position—would be a
                            formal “agreement to agree” on a post-treaty defense arrangement.
                            Obviously, this “agreement to agree” could take varied forms—e.g., a
                            mutual security agreement separate from but coordinated with the Canal
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>State is convinced that Panama would never accept an explicit perpetual
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> right of unilateral
                            intervention. State further believes that if we were to agree to a
                            treaty ending in 2000, Panama might accept a mechanism whereby Panama

                            (perhaps joined by others, such as <pb n="11" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_11"
                            />other Latins) that the waterway will always be open and neutral.
                            State’s reasoning is that if Panama ever closed the Canal to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> shipping, we could move to counter
                            that threat unilaterally whatever the treaty formula. Defense believes a
                            formal legal provision concerning post-treaty defense is important both
                            in itself and from the point of view of ratification. State and Defense
                            agree that some provision in the treaty, or a unilateral <gloss

                            insuring the Canal’s neutrality, would be useful in the ratification
                            process and would establish a basis for <gloss target="#t_US_2"

                        <p>The discussion in this section assumes that the new Administration wishes
                            to have a new treaty rapidly and, therefore, addresses how to resume the
                            negotiations and carry them forward at a satisfactory pace to their
                            completion. Another issue—Congressional concern—will be addressed
                            later.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option I—Start with a Formal Offer</p>
                        <p>Negotiations would be resumed only after inter-agency agreement had been
                            reached on instructions regarding major outstanding issues. The
                            instructions would involve the fixing of negotiating positions on these
                            issues and would identify a range of choices for each.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option II—Informal Exploration</p>
                        <p>At Presidential direction the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> would
                            resume negotiations promptly and seek through informal exploration with
                            Panama to fill remaining <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> needs in
                            exchange for <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> acceptance of the year
                            2000 as the duration of a new treaty. Having first obtained—in lieu of
                            formal guidance—an informal understanding with the President on the
                            limits of his flexibility, the Chief Negotiator also would be empowered
                            to address other options (trade-offs) on a “what if” basis if they
                            emerge from the discussions. Following the talks with Panama, our
                            negotiators would then report back to the President with a draft
                            “conceptual agreement” and recommendations for such changes as may be
                            necessary in Presidential instructions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion of Options</p>
                        <p>Option I would provide the new Administration an opportunity to examine
                            in depth the status of the negotiations and reach a coordinated position
                            on the major outstanding issues. It would provide clear guidance on how
                            and at what pace to proceed. At the same time it could facilitate
                            coordinated efforts to gain support for a treaty with the public and
                            Congress. However, the time involved in early resolution of intra-<gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> differences would substantially delay
                            resumption of negotiations. Such a delay could prevent us from reaching
                            agreement with Panama and gaining Congressional acceptance of a treaty
                            this year. Failure to resume the negotiations within a few weeks
                            following the inauguration <pb n="13" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_13"/>could
                            also be interpreted by our Congressional opponents, Panama and probably
                            the nations of this hemisphere as a signal that the new Administration
                            lacks commitment to move rapidly toward a new treaty.</p>
                        <p>Option II would allow early resumption of the negotiations and would
                            provide the negotiators with broad flexibility to probe for the basis of
                            agreement with Panama without requiring a time-consuming prior review of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> positions. By providing an
                            early positive signal as to our intent, Option II would assure Latin
                            America and the Third World of our interest in speedily resolving the
                            issue. The first step under this option would be an initial airing of
                            inter-agency views through discussion of an options paper culminating in
                            an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting and an understanding
                            between the President and the Chief Negotiator on the limits of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> proposals. The negotiators would then
                            meet with their Panamanian counterparts for exploratory discussions. The
                            improved understanding of possible alternatives resulting from these
                            early discussions would then allow the different <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies to surface the issues more
                            clearly for prompt Presidential decision.</p>
                        <p>Option II could permit the initialing of a “conceptual agreement” with
                            Panama by mid-March and presentation of a draft treaty to the President
                            for final concurrence by June 15. Formal treaty signing could occur by
                            July 1 and presentation to the Senate could follow by as early as August
                            1 (an early submission would be broadly advantageous to permit
                            ratification prior to the 1978 elections).</p>

                            almost no possibility that such a resolution would be adopted, it could
                            be a liability for the success of the negotiations and the treaty effort
                            if it were to attract the sponsorship of something approaching a
                            blocking third of the Senate membership. Sponsorship would tend to
                            commit Senators and make it more difficult for them to support a treaty
                            when one is submitted to the Senate. There is a danger that a number of
                            Senators might sign the resolution without fully appreciating the depth
                            of the Administration’s commitment to a new treaty effort—or the dangers
                            to our interests in the Canal from failure to have a new treaty. It
                            would be highly desirable to communicate the Administration’s views to
                            individual Senators and to urge them not to pre-judge the treaty
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>The second matter which will require attention concerns interagency
                            coordination. Until now the negotiators have relied on ordinary
                            interagency coordination procedures supplemented by the efforts of the
                            State-Defense Support Group, which has functioned as a negotiators’
                            “think-tank”. This group regularly drafts informal papers which, if
                            approved by the negotiators, are then introduced into the formal
                            interdepartmental clearance process.</p>
                        <p>State believes that it is likely that this procedure will not fully serve
                            the Administration’s purposes once the negotiating process is resumed
                            and efforts are accelerated in pursuit of an early treaty. It is State’s

                            function below the level of the Policy Review Group, would be fully
                            empowered to speak for their agencies in addressing rapidly the
                            negotiators’ requests for Executive Branch guidance. The Committee would
                            include representatives from State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                                believes</hi> that except for the most unusual circumstances, the
                            coordination authority available to the negotiators and the existing
                            Washington interagency mechanism will be more than adequate for issues
                            not requiring higher level <pb n="15" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_15"
                            />decision. Issues involving other agencies/departments of the Executive
                            Branch will be complex in nature and necessarily require thorough
                            analysis to insure that irrevocable mistakes are not permitted, through
                            haste, to become part of a major new treaty. When interagency issues are
                            identified, the appropriate agency should be tasked to respond to
                            State/Defense request for coordination. Defense suggests that standby
                            representatives of agencies listed above be identified early on, and if
                            a full interagency committee effort should be required at some future
                            date, the committee be chaired by a designated member of the <gloss

                                    Panamanian views is clouded by the pause in the negotiations
                                    which has existed since February 1976. Exploration of the issues
                                    with Panama will give a clearer focus as to what is, and what is
                                    not, negotiable;</p>
                                <p>—a seriatim review—in which each issue and the options for
                                    dealing with it are considered in isolation—leaves out certain
                                    considerations which need to be taken into account in devising
                                    an overall treaty package that meets <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                        >U.S.</gloss> interests. Some interests are more important
                                    than others. In addition, the issues are interrelated and
                                    trade-offs <pb n="16" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_16"/>among them are
                                    possible, so that the selection of an option under one issue may
                                    depend in part on what option is chosen under another related
                                    issue.</p>
                                <p>—the negotiability of an option relating to a specific issue may
                                    be affected by the nature of our positions on other issues. For
                                    example, so called “hard” positions on some issues might be
                                    acceptable to Panama in exchange for a concessionary <gloss

                                    would be to identify preferred <hi rend="italic">and</hi>

                                duration of operation to a period of not less than 20 years. The

                                an option would preclude any possibility of agreement with
                                Panama.</p>
                            <p>Panama has “definitively” rejected Option I and indicated strong
                                opposition to Options II, III and IV. Conceivably Panama would
                                accept some limited period for <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                defense rights beyond the year 2000, but the cost to the <gloss

                                neutrality or post-treaty defense arrangements. On the other hand,
                                Option V could meet Panama’s main political concern that the treaty
                                terminate by 2000 while guaranteeing that there would be a mutually
                                satisfactory post-treaty defense and/or neutrality agreement. If
                                Option V were selected, Defense believes a strong post-treaty
                                defense arrangement would be essential to safeguard <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interests in the Canal. State
                                believes that a neutrality agreement would be an adequate basis for
                                further <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> action.</p>
                            <p>Each of these options would encounter some resistance in Congress and
                                with the public. However, this opposition will be based more on the
                                general idea of “surrender” or “give away” than upon the adequacy of
                                a particular duration proposal. The shorter the term of <gloss

                                treaty, but would create only an obligation by Panama to the United
                                States to operate the canal forever in accordance with the
                                neutrality rules.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion of Options.</p>
                            <p>The differences among the five options are significant more in terms
                                of political pressures and posturing than in terms of strict legal
                                benefits. Any of them would legally bind Panama to keep the canal
                                neutral. None of them would provide the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> with an independent legal right to act with force
                                to remedy a violation of this obligation by Panama. This is so
                                because of restraints on the unilateral use of force to settle
                                disputes (even obvious violations of clear legal rights) in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                    >OAS</gloss> Charters. Therefore, the important factors in
                                considering these Options are their initial political acceptability
                                and the strength of the political justification they would provide
                                for any necessary future <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                military actions.</p>
                            <pb n="20" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_20"/>
                            <p>Option I presumably would be attractive to much of the Congress and
                                the public, since it would be a very specific formulation of what
                                the United States can do to protect its security interest in the
                                canal forever. On the other hand, a growing segment of the Congress
                                and the public might believe that such a provision is an extension
                                of a colonial relationship and would therefore be harmful to
                                long-term <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interests in the
                                canal and elsewhere and likely to engender opposition from within
                                Panama—opposition in which many countries of the world would support
                                Panama.</p>
                            <p>Even though most uses of force in Panama against Panama’s will would
                                violate the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> Charters and provoke considerable
                                international criticism, circumstances could develop in which the
                                President felt compelled to act with force. In such a case, it could
                                prove very helpful to our justification for so acting if we had the
                                language suggested in Option I to cite.</p>
                            <p>However, in State’s view, Panama could never accept such a <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> right and might even be inclined
                                to question the good faith of the United States in proposing it.
                                Also, it would be contrary to our interest to present this Option
                                unless we were reasonably sure that Panama would accept it. Were
                                Panama to reject it, the negotiating record would show we had wanted
                                an explicit intervention right, but had been unable to obtain it.
                                Thereafter, we would have even more difficulty in arguing that the
                                broad and very general neutrality guarantee provision we finally got
                                was intended to mean that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                could take any action it deemed appropriate, including intervention,
                                to ensure the neutrality of the canal.</p>
                            <p>Defense believes that, packaged appropriately with careful drafting,
                                this Option may be acceptable to Panama. Its proposal and rejection
                                would not make appreciably more difficult any argument that we had
                                an intervention right without specific use-of-force language to
                                cite.</p>
                            <p>Option II, while imposing an obligation on Panama to keep the canal
                                neutral, would probably be less attractive to the Congress and
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> public because it would not
                                provide as strong a political justification for any <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military action as Option I. This
                                option would communicate our commitment to the permanent neutrality
                                of the canal without stating explicitly that we would take measures,
                                against Panama’s will, to see that the canal’s neutrality is
                                maintained. State believes that Option II would provide almost as
                                much protection for our long-term interests as Option I and could be
                                sold to the Congress and the public on this basis. The Department of
                                Defense believes that this Option would encounter stiff opposition
                                on the Hill. There is a good chance that Panama ultimately would
                                accept a skillfully worded formulation of Option II as part of an
                                overall package satisfactory to Panama on the duration issue.</p>
                            <pb n="21" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_21"/>
                            <p>Option III is very similar in all respects but form to Option I.</p>
                            <p>Option IV would add other nations as guarantors to the Option II
                                formulation. Although this option has the advantage of probable
                                acceptability to Panama, it has the disadvantage of encumbering
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> unilateral actions to
                                protect the canal’s neutrality.</p>
                            <p>Option V has already been proposed by Panama. It is less attractive
                                as a basis for future political justification of <gloss

                                thus less attractive to Congress and the public. So although its
                                strictly legal effects would not be significantly different from
                                that of the other options, it probably would have to be coupled with
                                other post-treaty defense arrangements to satisfy the public and
                                Congress of our ability to protect our long-term security
                                interests.</p>

                            <p>Option I is, in essence, a defense right in perpetuity. Thus this
                                option would be subject to considerations similar to those expressed
                                under Neutrality Option I. This position provides the <gloss

                            <p>Option II was presented to Panama in September of 1975.<note n="21"

                                withdrawn. However, it is only an “agreement to agree” and might be
                                acceptable ultimately to Panama in the context of an acceptable
                                duration proposal particularly if the element of military presence
                                were eliminated. It would have some attraction for the Congress and
                                public opinion because it would show Panama has agreed in principle
                                to our continued involvement in canal defense beyond the term of the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>Option III is similar to Option II with the modification that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> participation in canal
                                defense would be without a military presence in Panama. While
                                preferable to no post-treaty defense arrangements, this option is
                                not favored over Option I since lack of forces in place
                                significantly complicates any <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                exercise of its defense role.</p>
                            <p>Option IV would not commit Panama to anything other than good faith

                                defense role. Thus, it would not <pb n="23" facs="0058"

                                some slight psychological value in convincing the Congress and the
                                public of our ability to protect those long-term interests. Its
                                value, however, might be in making it easier politically for Panama
                                to agree to a continuing <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                defense role at the time the treaty terminates.</p>
                            <p>Option V would affirm that Panama would be an ally of the United
                                States beyond the treaty period. It would also demonstrate our
                                continuing commitment to ensure the security of the canal. The
                                psychological effect of Panama’s commitment to remain our ally would
                                be significant to Congress and to the public.</p>
                            <p>Under Option VI Panama would not be agreeing to any <gloss

                                Congress would be somewhat reassured by our declaration of intent to
                                take necessary action to protect our interests. This, however, is
                                not as protective to our security interests as a mutual security
                                agreement would be because it does not demonstrate that Panama would
                                be a continuing ally of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and
                                could be countered at any time by a declaration from Panama that it

                            <p>Until December 1975, the United States position on this issue
                                envisaged relinquishing only those areas of the current Canal Zone
                                which were of limited value to the United States. The Presidential
                                guidance contained in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 302
                                endorsed this approach. The Panamanian position was based upon: (a)
                                its narrow definition of those areas whose use it considered that
                                the United States would require for canal operation and defense, as
                                modified by; (b) its perception of its own requirements in terms of
                                domestic political acceptability and for purposes of economic
                                development. The two positions based on these divergent approaches
                                to the issue resulted in a stalemate. In December 1975, the United
                                States Negotiators initiated development of a compromise lands and
                                waters position designed to accommodate the United States’
                                requirements for operation and defense of the canal in a combined
                                United States-Panamanian defense arrangement, while taking into
                                account to the extent possible, Panama’s economic and political
                                    requirements.<note n="22" xml:id="d3fn22">See <ref

                            <p>The return of any areas of the present Canal Zone to Panama will
                                result in some criticism by the Congress and the general public.
                                However, it is improbable that the degree of such criticism will
                                relate to the details of what specific areas are relinquished to
                                Panama and what areas are retained by the United States so long as
                                these details have the support of all interested agencies of the
                                Executive Branch.</p>
                            <p>From the Panamanian standpoint, retention by the United States of the
                                entire Canal Zone, or of what appeared in Panama to be
                                overly-substantial parts of it, would mean no agreement. It is now
                                generally recognized by both State and Defense that agreement with
                                Panama is therefore not possible on the basis of the lands and
                                waters position reflected in current Presidential guidance. Option I
                                is not realistically supported by any interested agency of the
                                United States Government.</p>
                            <p>The process of negotiation on this issue has consisted of seeking
                                both to educate the Panamanian negotiators as to the nature of
                                United <pb n="25" facs="0060" xml:id="pg_25"/>States requirements
                                relating to the operation and defense of the canal, and seeking to
                                develop a compromise United States position as described above.</p>
                            <p>State and Defense consider that essential United States interests on
                                this subject may be achieved through continuing to pursue these
                                discussions with the Panamanian negotiators. Our objective in doing
                                so should continue to be to resolve the manifold individual
                                questions making up this issue in a manner which takes maximum
                                account of Panama’s requirements while retaining for the United
                                States the necessary rights to use those specific lands and waters
                                which will be needed for canal operation and defense under a new
                                treaty assuming a combined United States-Panamanian defense
                                arrangement. It should be noted that the Secretary of the Army has
                                presented a lands-and-waters position which differs in some respects
                                from the negotiators’ unofficial proposal. These differences are
                                being considered by the negotiators in the preparation of their
                                position.</p>

                            <p>No direct Presidential guidance exists on this issue. However, the
                                United States negotiators have sought to achieve rights and

                            <p>Retention of an adequate United States citizen component of the Canal
                                work-force is essential until such time as the particular skills
                                provided by this group are obtainable—as in many cases they
                                presently are not—in the Panamanian labor market. Our basic
                                objective on this issue is the provision of rights, privileges and
                                benefits sufficient to permit the retention and/or recruitment from
                                the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> labor force of the skills
                                required.</p>
                            <p>Everyone, including Panamanians, agrees that United States citizen
                                Canal employees should not suffer economic losses or job insecurity
                                as a result of a new treaty and that employee rights should be
                                adequately covered in the treaty. However, there is still a marked
                                difference in United States and Panamanian perceptions of what, in
                                specific terms, will be required to achieve our objectives in
                                relation to Canal operation.</p>
                            <p>This issue has generated a tremendous emotional charge in the Canal
                                Zone; Canal employees actively campaigning against a new treaty have
                                exploited the insecurities of other employees concerning their
                                uncertainties as to their status under a new treaty. The issue has
                                therefore assumed additional importance in humanitarian terms and as
                                a political issue within the United States.</p>
                            <p>United States labor organizations appear disposed to support an
                                arrangement which provides normal job guarantees for employees,
                                without evidencing a particular concern for special status for
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> public and Congress would probably
                                go along with an arrangement which appeared fair to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen employees.</p>
                            <p>Many of the actions necessary in relation to Canal employees would
                                fall outside the scope of the treaty as being either within the
                                competence of the management of the new Canal entity, and/or as
                                subjects for unilateral resolution by the United States
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Panama’s negotiators have declined to consider outright inclusion of
                                Canal entity <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen employees
                                under the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>, but might accept
                                some modified version of rights analagous to those accorded in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> if “repackaged.” The

                                greatly in the event we were to agree to a “favorable” resolution of

                            <p>This issue involves the nature and structure of the new entity that
                                will operate the canal for the life of the new treaty.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background.</p>
                            <p>Current Presidential guidance directs that effective <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> control of canal operations (for a
                                duration of time consistent with guidance) is to be considered
                                non-negotiable; it provides further that the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >first</hi> negotiating objective should be continued exclusive
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> control of canal
                                operations, and that the <hi rend="italic">fallback</hi>
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> position should be an
                                arrangement whereby the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> retains
                                control of canal operations with Panamanian participation in the
                                canal organization (<gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 115).</p>
                            <p>The Panamanian position on this issue is that the new entity be an
                                international juridical entity, jointly created by means of the
                                treaty, with <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority control.
                                Under the Panamanian approach, the existence of the entity would
                                terminate along with the termination of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> control at the end of the treaty. Recent
                                Panamanian proposals have included the concept of a termination of
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority control in the
                                year 1995 with <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> minority
                                participation until the end of the treaty, which would be the year
                                2000.</p>
                            <p>In the February 1974 Joint Statement of Principles<note n="24"
                                    xml:id="d3fn24">See <ref target="#d3fn10">footnote 10</ref>
                                    above.</note> and in the November 1974 Threshold Agreements, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> agreed to the concepts of
                                participation by Panama, and increasing participation by
                                Panamanians, in the administration of the canal. In those same
                                agreements, however, Panama agreed to “grant to the United States”
                                the rights necessary to operate and maintain the canal for the
                                duration of the new treaty. Implicit was that a <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agency would exercise these rights
                                    <pb n="28" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_28"/>on behalf of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. More recently, Panama has
                                proposed that the treaty grant the operation-related rights to a
                                jointly created international juridical entity, as outlined above.
                                The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> negotiators have
                                consistently maintained that the new entity be a <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agency, but recently have
                                indicated a willingness to explore the possibility of an
                                international juridical entity along the lines of OPTION III

                                thereafter. Panama would enjoy minority participation for the

                                and would have a right to majority control at a certain date

                                <hi rend="italic">State and Defense</hi> both believe that Option I
                                    (<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agency) would lend itself
                                to the simplest treatment in the treaty and the process of
                                negotiation. It would also be attractive to Congress, since Congress
                                would establish the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agency and
                                delegate to it the operating rights. Correspondingly, Option I would
                                also insure Congressional control over the exercise of our
                                operation-related rights, including the rights to control employee
                                relations, navigation and tolls, which Panama has already agreed to.
                                It also would be, however, the most difficult of the three options
                                for Panama to accept, and is not necessarily the most protective for
                                our interest of the three options.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">State and Defense</hi> agree, conversely, that
                                Option II would be acceptable to Panama, but would be the least
                                attractive of the three options to Congress.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> insisted on the same
                                duration of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority control as
                                under Option I. Panama’s willingness to accept a longer duration of
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> minority participation
                                would be increased if the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> would
                                also be willing to accept a shorter duration of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority control than is
                                authorized by current guidance. (A reduced duration is not key to
                                this option for <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority
                                control.) Domestic <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                                acceptability of Option III would be enhanced by a period of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> minority participation following
                                the termination of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority
                                control, but would be hampered by any reduction in the period of
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> majority control of canal
                                operations. Further, Option III would give selected user nations
                                some understanding of the problems of canal management, and their
                                participation would add a measure of stability to canal operation
                                over the long term and could have a moderating effect on Panamanian
                                ambitions to realize excessive profits from canal operations.
                                Finally, this option would, as a practical matter, allow for the
                                possibility of Panama’s continuing the entity voluntarily beyond the
                                termination of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion of Options.</p>
                            <p>There has been limited study within the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                    >USG</gloss> of the question of financial benefits. Further
                                immediate review is planned in order to determine specific
                                compensation packages which might appropriately be proposed in the
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Option I, by making Panamanian receipts dependent on the volume of
                                shipping using the Canal, provides an incentive for Panama to
                                cooperate in insuring that the Canal operates efficiently and that
                                maximum traffic is encouraged. Its principal disadvantage is that
                                the amount generated may be insufficient to meet Panamanian desires.
                                Further, if Canal revenue were insufficient to cover the payments,
                                the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would have to seek
                                Congressional appropriations in order to meet its obligations to
                                Panama.</p>
                            <p>Option II would permit us to offer a larger package of financial
                                benefits to Panama. This would contribute to facilitating overall
                                agreement on a new treaty. By offering to Panama, through a variety
                                of means, <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> assistance in
                                integrating the Canal into its economy and furthering its own
                                development, it would contribute to increased prospects for
                                long-term Panamanian stability and for providing the secure
                                environment that is essential to continued efficient operation of
                                the Canal. It would also enable us to assist Panama in such
                                activities as preparing the Panamanian armed forces to participate
                                in defense of the canal, to develop the manpower needed to operate
                                it, and to help Panama meet the costs of taking over certain
                                functions (fire, police, <pb n="31" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_31"
                                />courts, etc.) as jurisdiction passes early in the new treaty
                                period. Since Panama, because of its pressing financial problems and
                                high debt service levels, will find it difficult to find
                                international lenders for planned projects, Panama would certainly
                                be attracted by a <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> package
                                involving investments in the Canal operation and infrastructure and
                                funds to support a smooth transition to Panamanian jurisdiction. By
                                helping to provide the favorable economic climate in Panama that
                                would serve <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interests, a
                                well-designed Option II package presumably could be made acceptable
                                to the Congress in spite of its inherent preference for an option
                                financed from tolls.</p>
                            <p>Many of the items that might be included in this option—such as base
                                rights payments, economic and security assistance, or an annuity,
                                would require Congressional appropriations, with consequent
                                requirement to justify these expenditures to Congress. We anticipate
                                that Congress might be more resistant to appropriations for general
                                economic and security assistance than for expenditures that have
                                some close relation to canal operations, such as aid to help Panama
                                exploit commercial opportunities in the Zone (e.g., construction of
                                a container port) or to improve Panamanian military forces to enable
                                them to contribute to Canal defense. Defense opposes payments for
                                base rights during the life of a new treaty on the grounds that the
                                primary function of the bases is canal defense, which is equally of
                                benefit to Panama and the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            </p>
                            <p>With regard to credit for physical assets, the monetary value of the
                                package could be substantially increased if these items were
                                included. However, it is likely that Panama will not attach much
                                weight to benefits of this sort, since these assets will be
                                available to Panama under a new treaty in any event.</p>

                                before preparing proposals under this option, Presidential guidance
                                should be sought on the appropriateness of incorporating elements in
                                such proposals that would require the use of appropriated funds.</p>
                            <p>Defense believes that an exceptionally large compensation package to
                                Panama, as may be envisioned in Option II, could well endanger
                                Congressional and public acceptance of the treaty.</p>

                                control of canal operations. Option I would be similar to the rights

                            <p>Option II is the position we currently have tabled with Panama. It
                                will give us a right definitive enough to allow us to undertake the
                                addition of a third lane of locks to the present canal should we
                                decide to do so. This will be attractive to some members of Congress
                                and the public. Panama’s current position is so close to Option II
                                that it seems likely Panama would accept this option in the context
                                of an entire treaty package.</p>
                            <p>Option III would allow us to agree to Panama’s current position. It

                            <p>d. Instruct appropriate agencies to begin working promptly to lessen
                                congressional support, particularly in the Senate, for prospective
                                anti-treaty initiatives including those designed to cut off funds

                                concerned interests groups—veterans organizations, business groups,
                                labor unions, church groups, Hispanic Americans. Perhaps also the
                                organization of a national “Citizen’s Committee for a Panama

                                early fireside chat is decided upon to set a positive public
                                framework for the negotiations, it should focus more on the <gloss

                        <p>1. Following our meeting today, I discussed the Panama Canal Negotiations
                            with the Secretary of Defense in preparation for the Policy Review
                            Committee Meeting tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">For the minutes of
                                the January 27 Policy Review Committee Meeting, see <ref

                        <p>2. There are two basic issues, i.e., duration and defense.</p>
                        <p>3. It appears that following the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            Working Group report <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss> #1<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d4fn3">See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> that
                            duration will be; “The Treaty on the operation, protection, and defense
                            of the Canal will terminate 31 December 1999.”</p>
                        <p>4. As for defense in the post-treaty period, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> leans toward inclusion of the
                            following words in the proposed treaty: “The United States and Panama
                            agree that the neutrality of the Canal will continue beyond the
                            termination of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operations and each
                            country commits itself to protect the Canal after the termination of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operations.”</p>
                        <p>5. In my view, the position reflected above is one I can support and will
                            give us what we need in the way of assurance that the Canal will be
                            available to us for as long as we may require it and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> can intervene in defense of the Canal
                            when it feels it should. It also has the advantage of probably being
                            palatable to Panama. I would like to have your views on this by 0900,
                            tomorrow, 27 January, prior to my departure for the Policy Review

                                guaranteeing a role in defense but supported the neutrality option,

                            represents a basis for discussing the issue. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >major</hi> issues are correctly identified and the major
                            differences between State and Defense are stated in the options, if not
                            in the body of the paper. As I mentioned to you, State believes that the
                            Canal is of declining strategic and economic utility, and its primary
                            interest is in securing a treaty with Panama. The Defense Department
                            continues to see the Canal as “vital”, but has reluctantly agreed to a
                            treaty; any departure from the status quo, however, is painful to
                            Defense. These differences are reflected in the text where a State

                            significance is balanced against a Defense Department’s sentence
                            proclaiming it a “major” defense asset.</p>
                        <p>The continuing debate (see pp. 6–9) between State and Defense served to
                            focus the paper to an unwarranted degree, in my judgment, on only the

                        <p>The State Department has erased a third, middle option providing some
                            Presidential guidance short of fixed instructions to the negotiators.
                            Option 1 (a formal offer) seems to expect too much to transpire at a
                            single <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> meeting, while Option 2
                            (informal exploration), in my opinion, expects too little. The reason, I
                            believe, that the State Department deleted the middle option is because
                            they think even that option would lead to a bureaucratic stalemate, and
                            they believe it is essential for the negotiators to return to Panama as
                            soon as possible, and, of course, Option 2 (informal exploration) will
                            accomplish that objective.</p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="0073" xml:id="pg_38"/>
                        <p>In my opinion, the process will be most effectively speeded up, if the
                            negotiators could return to Panama with some sense of where the
                            President stood on the major unresolved issues. Thus, an informal
                            understanding between the President and the negotiators prior to their
                            return combined with a coordinated lobbying campaign represents the best
                            strategy for moving toward a new treaty.</p>

                            role or veto. Even though it is not mentioned, I believe it is essential
                            for a Congressional Liaison to play a full role in these
                                discussions.<note n="13" xml:id="d5fn13">

                            Panamanian position is necessary, and where differences within the

                            to include it in the treaty or to have a secret protocol, but rather to
                            ignore this item for ten years until the responsibility for operations
                            and defense begin to shift to Panama and the relationship between the
                            two countries rises to a more mature level. Thus, Options 5, 4, 6, 3, in

                            is not in addressing a genuine threat to the Canal, but in dealing with
                            “salami-type” policies—e.g. (the equivalent of) excluding Israel from
                            the Canal, or raising rates for one or two countries. We could not send
                            the Marines in for this; and probably the only response by the <gloss

                            still much higher than the amount of land we use (6%). An exploratory

                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Zonians</hi>. There are two issues here: (1) how to
                            ensure an adequate American work force to operate the Canal; and (2) how
                            to guarantee the job safety and benefits for the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> employees in the Zone. Only the first question is
                            addressed in this paper, and Option 1 (rights equivalent to <gloss
                                target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>) appears the best means to achieve
                            this objective.</p>
                        <p>The second issue, however, must be addressed quickly to ensure that the
                            AFL-CIO, which is very concerned about the jobs of its union members in
                            the Zone, is transformed from a major obstacle to treaty ratification
                            into a significant supporter.</p>
                        <p>g. <hi rend="italic">Canal Operating Entity</hi>. Option 1 is the present
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> position, but it would be
                            helpful to permit negotiators to explore other possibilities.</p>
                        <p>h. <hi rend="italic">Financial Benefits</hi>. On this issue, it is
                            important to keep in mind that Congress would not be very receptive to
                            the idea of generously compensating Panama for, in effect, taking the
                                Canal.<note n="18" xml:id="d5fn18">

                            essential—i.e., it should not be permitted to hold up negotiations—since

                        <p>In State’s agenda, this section will be discussed only “if time permits”.
                            In my opinion, this should be the second item on the agenda, and Tab 10
                            provides a good list of all those steps that need to be taken. In
                            addition to those points, however, it would be useful to discuss:</p>
                        <p>a. The role of <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> in
                            coordinating this effort. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> have a good personal relationship and can work
                            out their respective roles in negotiations on an informal basis; but on
                            the issue of mobilizing domestic support, <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> clearly has a comparative advantage, which he
                            could most effectively exploit if he were working out of the White
                            House, rather than State. This is an essential point: every important
                            and successful lobbying campaign on a major foreign policy issue—from
                            the Marshall Plan to the Trade Expansion Act—has been run out of the
                            White House, where the coordinator can involve domestic groups much more
                            easily and engage the Defense Department as well as State.</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> should testify in open

                            transcript immediately available for distribution) at the earliest.</p>
                        <p>c. The President should encourage congressional leaders to organize a
                            Consultative Committee to work closely with the <gloss target="#t_US_2"

                        <p>a. It is important for a summary of the meeting to be sent to the
                            President and that the Secretary of State or yourself brief him on the
                            meeting. Then, the President should meet with the negotiators either in

                        <p>5) we should immediately begin a well-organized and coordinated effort,
                            involving the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense and State
                            Departments, to obtain Congressional support, particularly among the new
                            Senators; it was also suggested that a National Citizens Committee on
                            the Panama Canal be set up to stimulate a national educational campaign,
                            directed at defense-oriented and other groups.</p>

                            and post-treaty events; all agreed, including the Chiefs of Staff, on a
                            formula which would make the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and
                            Panama both guarantors of the neutrality of the Canal without specifying

                            particularly since <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> has been
                            tangled in some differences with <persName corresp="#p_GRE_1"
                                >Gonzalez</persName> who apparently takes a harder line. This is the
                            first real evidence we have of what may be a breakthrough. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> takes the position that the most
                            important items are duration and neutrality. He is prepared to go to the
                            year 2000 on duration along with a proviso which would permit the <gloss

                            the Canal, with the express permission of the Panamanian Government. It
                            looks as though they have blinked. <persName corresp="#p_GRE_1"
                                >Gonzalez</persName> doesn’t like the idea of a bilateral guarantee
                            and would prefer international attention to this, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> has said this is not realistic.
                            He believes the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will stick with the
                            year 2000 and must have some assurances on neutrality and defense.</p>

                            has a list of items on which he will express the Panamanian point of

                            talks. He understands we have made no commitment to a statement. I have
                            a copy of their proposed text which is rather bland. It basically
                            reaffirms the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Tack</persName>-<persName

                            disagree? We could reaffirm the principles, then possibly later make a

                            submission to the President in July and to Congress in August. Let’s go
                            around the table on these two options. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                                >Bunker</persName>: I am strongly in favor of Option 2. Option 1
                            would be too time-consuming. Also, we don’t know enough about the
                            Panamanian attitude. We assume they will stick to the year 2000 but we
                            should explore what we can get in return. We could talk on a “what-if”
                            basis, ad referendum, of course. This latest intelligence confirms what
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> said to me. I told him
                            that if we agreed to 2000 we would need the strongest kind of neutrality
                            guarantee. I told him the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> can’t
                            depend on anyone else for its security—that we had to assure this
                            ourselves. <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> said he
                            understood this. I think we can make progress if we start exploring.
                            They’re more flexible now than at any time during my negotiations with
                            them. They need a treaty; their economic situation is bad. If we want to
                            get a treaty by June 1, Option 2 is the only way to go.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: This is, of
                            course, interrelated to the Congressional and public aspects which we
                            will discuss later. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold</persName>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>: I think
                            negotiating flexibility is necessary. It would be helpful for them to
                            know where we want to come out, but a formal position at this time would
                            leak and might not be an acceptable solution.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I’m worried about the
                            backlash on Panama. I used to give a speech saying that our involvement
                            in Vietnam was not in our national interest, it was thousands of miles
                            away, but the situation in Panama was in our national interest. They
                            would stand up and cheer. I would tell them they were misinterpreting
                            me, they were wrong, but they would still cheer. I finally stopped
                            giving the speech. (Showing an American Legion pamphlet) They send me
                            these all the time. Here we’re accused of selling arms to Panama, paid
                            for in cash, by a country that is broke.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>: So that’s Option

                            intertwined. We can’t decide definitely on them today. I have my own
                            ideas and I imagine there are differing views around the table. We won’t

                        <p>The Secretary noted his pleasure at participating in so auspicious an
                            occasion—the effective resumption of negotiations. He then confirmed for
                            the Foreign Minister that the United States intended to reach for an
                            early treaty, fulfilling previous Presidential commitments. The <pb
                                n="53" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_53"/>process had already been
                            stretched out too long, he said. He then made these points:</p>
                        <p>1. The process of negotiations will not be helped if there are pressures
                            on the United States in international fora or if there are “incidents”
                            which have an adverse impact on public opinion in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. The United States cannot sacrifice its fundamental interests in these
                            negotiations, nor ignore the opinion of the Congress and of the American
                            people.</p>
                        <p>3. If an agreement is to be reached promptly, there must be flexibility
                            on both sides—there must be discussion of the issues, and compromise, at
                            all difficult points.</p>
                        <p>4. The parties might try to agree today on an exact—and early—date for
                            resumption of the negotiations. Both sides must move with all deliberate
                            speed to achieve a prompt conclusion of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>5. Each must recognize the other’s aspirations. The major <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interest is an open and neutral canal
                            to which all nations can always have access. Panamanian aspirations and
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> views do not appear to be
                            inconsistent. Consequently it is surely possible to come to an agreement
                            that is satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> responded that it
                            is essential to continue negotiating within the context of the <persName

                        <p>He observed that the invitation to visit Washington—the first Foreign
                            Minister to be so invited—in order to hold serious discussions on a
                            serious matter is symbolic of how important the United States regards
                            the Panama question. He assured the Secretary that this gesture had had
                            favorable repercussions not only in Panama but also throughout Latin
                            America—and was the best possible response to the letter from seven

                        </p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that the Secretary’s remark about the United
                            States wishing to achieve a treaty as promptly as possible had made a
                            “magnificent” impression on the Panamanian Delegation. Not only Latin
                            American public opinion but also world opinion favors a prompt <pb
                                n="54" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_54"/>solution of this problem. Thus,
                            if the two countries move seriously and speedily, Panama will have no
                            time to present its sentiments—nor any necessity to do so—in
                            international fora.</p>
                        <p>If the United States cannot be expected to sacrifice its fundamental
                            interests, he said, it is also true that the United States must respond
                            to Panama’s “basic needs”, such as fixing a reasonable duration for the
                            new treaty—and that should be the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>Panama appreciates how the fundamental institutions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> operate, and knows the problem of
                            public and Congressional opinion.</p>
                        <p>Panama, too, has problems. 1.7 million Panamanians consider themselves
                            experts on resolving the Panama problem; it is the matter that they
                            think about constantly.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of a joint communique, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> noted President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s reaffirmation of the
                            “Principles”. If the Democratic Administration now reaffirmed those
                            Principles it would be useful for public opinion in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>, and would be useful in Panama and all
                            Latin America.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that a joint statement would be useful as tangible
                            evidence of progress.</p>
                        <p>He then raised the fundamental guidelines under which the negotiations
                            will continue. Noting Panama’s intent to work seriously, and the
                            Minister’s statement that Panama will have neither time nor need for
                            raising this matter in other fora, the Secretary stated that he is
                            prepared to proceed on the basis of the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Tack</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            Joint Statement of Principles.</p>
                        <p>He noted, however, that this was not an easily-made decision—that long
                            and serious consideration had been given to it. The United States
                            believes that with a spirit of cooperation and flexibility the two
                            countries can proceed under the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Tack</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            Principles, and that this decision constituted a major first step toward
                            a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the joint announcement, the Secretary stated that it would be
                            useful to note that the two countries have agreed to make a sustained
                            effort to conclude a new treaty at an early date.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> for a date for the next meeting. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> suggested the 10th of
                            February.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> noted that the
                            reports of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>’
                            appointment had been taken very well in Panama. He also noted Panama’s
                            admiration for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                            and said that his presence at the negotiating table lends a specific
                            significance to the United States purpose. He also stated that Panama
                            knows <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> as a lawyer and
                            statesman who is knowledgeable about Latin America. He observed that the
                            combination of <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> will have an “explosive <pb
                                n="55" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_55"/>impact” on the pursuit of the
                            negotiators’ objectives. He accepted February 10 as a satisfactory date
                            and stated that this will have a favorable impact in Panama, Latin
                            America and the whole world.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> also asked that the
                            joint statement refer to the objective of concluding the negotiations in
                            1977.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it would be better to refer only to conclusion
                            of a treaty “at an early date”, without a time limit because mention of
                            a date would cause problems with Congress. The term “an early date”
                            conveys the correct message without creating problems. He also suggested
                            that it be called a “joint statement” rather than “joint communique”, a
                            term usually reserved for Presidential use. He suggested drafting a
                            text, reading it to the press and answering a few questions after
                                luncheon.<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">

                        <p>The Minister agreed and asked Dr. Escobar and Dr. Illueca to represent
                            Panama in the drafting of a statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"

                        <p>During the lunch, Ambassador Illueca asked the Secretary how the National
                            Security Council viewed the negotiations. The Secretary replied that
                            there had been a meeting only a few days ago.<note n="5" xml:id="d9fn5"
                                >See <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> The subject was
                            given much serious thought. The question of continuing under the

                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Principles arose, and it was
                            decided that if Panama wished to move seriously and flexibly, then the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Tack</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Principles represented a
                            good starting point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary offered a toast noting that the United States cares deeply
                            about its relationship with Panama and is determined to move the
                            negotiations forward successfully and promptly. While there will, of
                            course, be bumps in the road, the United States feels that a melding of
                            the aspirations of Panama and the necessities of the United States
                            (which lie in an open and neutral canal always) will lead to a solution
                            which is just.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> replied that Panama
                            and Latin America are very, very much interested in coming to terms with
                            the United States in 1977. He said that emotions are even higher now
                            than in 1964<note n="6" xml:id="d9fn6">A reference to the violent riots
                                which erupted in the Panama Canal Zone on January 9, 1964, and
                                resulted in a temporary breaking of relations between Panama and the
                                United States.</note>—the “colonial enclave” has grown to be a still
                            greater burden. Panama <pb n="56" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_56"/>believes
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is on the
                            road toward avoiding another episode like 1964. He expressed the hope
                            that the morality of the new Administration will serve as a “floating
                            balloon” to by-pass the bumps in the road mentioned by the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>To the Secretary’s query, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> noted that the negotiators have completed a
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> and conceptual agreements on
                            administration, canal defense, jurisdiction and use rights.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> mentioned the lands
                            and water papers which, when agreed to, will constitute an annex to the
                            Status of Force Agreement. He added that on lands and waters Panama
                            still has some concerns, among them the Balboa port. The United States
                            wants to provide Panama only one pier and wants the canal operating
                            entity to keep the rest, to be rented to private enterprises. He
                            described this as unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName>
                            commented that during the last substantive negotiating round Panama
                            presented a document which outlined its comprehensive view of the exact
                            state of the negotiations.<note n="7" xml:id="d9fn7">See <ref

                            the ball is now in the United States court. He asked whether Panama can

                            response.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that it is his policy to place the responsibility
                            for the negotiations on the negotiators. He noted that he prefers to
                            choose skilled negotiators and let them proceed.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> repeated Panama’s
                            desire for a reply to the October 21 paper.<note n="8" xml:id="d9fn8"
                                >Ibid.</note> In reply the Secretary noted the importance of
                            flexibility. He asked Panama to look at its negotiating positions as
                            outlined in the paper and to come into the new round with no rigid
                            positions. He said the United States would follow a similar
                            practice.</p>

                        <p>I fully support these positions. The position on neutrality has the

                        <p>I continue to believe that the exercise of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            period. I visualize a small ground-air force, not more than a battalion

                            access to reinforcing forces if they were needed to meet a threat to the

                        <p>With a new treaty apparently imminent, I consider that there is an
                            immediate requirement for an assessment of the mission to be assigned to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military commander in Panama
                            during the treaty period. The size of his forces and the supporting base
                            structure, as well as the definition of lands and waters for defense,
                            are dependent on the extent to which that mission includes unilateral
                            and combined defense aspects. This is also a prerequisite to the
                            development of the defense concept and the development of the Guardia
                            Nacional’s (<gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>) force capability for
                            combined defense of the Canal. The treaty should provide that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> commander will validate the capability
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> to contribute to Canal defense
                            as a condition precedent to any <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> force
                            reduction or <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> base relinquishment
                            during the treaty period.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the positions addressed above, it is important that a
                            close look be given to negotiators’ proposals for a shedding of certain
                            of the logistic and administrative functions of the present Panama Canal
                            Company/Canal Zone Government to the Department of Defense (<gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>). For example, present proposals are
                            that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> assume responsibility for
                            health and education services for all members of the military forces,
                            dependents and employees as well as for the employees of the Canal
                            entity and their dependents. If performed by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>, these major support activities would require, among
                            other aspects, a larger amount of housing to be placed under <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military control than we now plan, as
                            well as an evaluation of the statutory basis of providing these services
                            to non-<gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> personnel.</p>
                        <p>While not a central defense issue, I believe it pertinent to ask the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff to urge an early guarantee of the rights of the
                            employees of the Panama Canal Company. Such a public assurance from the
                            United States Government while the negotiating and ratifying process is
                            going on would do much to neutralize the expected disquiet of the
                            employees and, concomitantly, reduce a possible threat to the security
                            of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate this opportunity to consider the latest <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> position on defense and neutrality of
                            the Panama Canal, and I am prepared to participate in a continuing
                            review of these and other Canal defense matters.</p>

                            what all expect to be a very lengthy and heated debate on a new Panama
                            Canal treaty. Gold believes a new treaty will be before the Senate by
                            September 1977 at the latest. Although the major responsibility for
                            informing the Senate will lie with the Committee on Foreign Relations
                            and the Committee on Armed Services, the Select Committee feels that
                            they will have some role to play in enlightening the Senate on the
                            issues involved. The Committee would like to prepare a classified report
                            which will deal with two questions expected to be discussed during the
                            ratification debate:</p>

                                should not be considered a Cuban tool nor should it be assumed that
                                the flow of information from the Panamanians to the Cubans is
                                unrestricted.” (Central Intelligence Agency, Office of Congressional

                            and the Committee wants to be able to contribute some facts to this
                            debate on the above two points.</p>

                        <p>3. Gold said that he, Mike Madigan, and Walt Ricks, of the Select
                            Committee staff, plus one Committee research assistant, would be the
                            staff members conducting the study. The Committee’s report would be
                            classified, subject to Agency views on dissemination, with it probably
                            available only in the Committee offices to Senators during the debate.
                            Gold said that the three staff members, after thoroughly researching the
                            subject here, will probably fly to the Canal Zone via military transport
                            to examine the same questions in Panama. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

                            had been interested in the allegations of Agency involvement in the

                        <p>(1) I was very pleased to be able to have such an early meeting with the
                            foreign minister to discuss the Canal negotiations and thus underscore
                            the importance we attach to an early settlement.<note n="3"

                                The meeting focused primarily on the sudden resignation of <persName

                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Our conversation revealed a mutual interest in pursuing serious
                            sustained negotiation without any diversionary tactics in order to
                            conclude a treaty at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>(3) I was surprised and disturbed to be informed by Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> that you were unhappy
                            over reports of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> insistence on
                            security rights after the termination of the treaty. I wish to emphasize
                                <pb n="62" facs="0097" xml:id="pg_62"/>that during my discussions
                            with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName> I
                            stressed the importance of the continued neutrality of the Canal. No
                            hard and fast positions were taken but you should be well aware of our
                            concern about that issue, a concern strongly felt by many members of our
                            congress.</p>
                        <p>(4) I stressed to the foreign minister the need for flexibility on both
                            sides as we face complex issues in which both sides would understandably
                            be defending the interests of our respective countries.</p>
                        <p>(5) The basic <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> purpose in the
                            negotiations and in the treaty is to ensure a safe, efficient and
                            neutral Canal.</p>
                        <p>(6) The details of the negotiations will be left to our negotiators in
                            whom we have the highest confidence.</p>

                            greeted us and then took us into the Oval Office, where we awaited the

                                >Brzezinski</persName> encountered the President’s Appointment
                            Secretary, a young man who had served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala
                            before he returned to the University, where he acquired an interest in
                            politics and ultimately became a devoted supporter of <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Jody Powell</persName>, the President’s
                            Press Secretary, entered for a few moments and then suddenly the
                            President came into the room quietly and as he saw me he called out,
                            “Hello, Sol” and came striding forward. He shook hands with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName> and told him how
                            pleased he was to see him and then he and I shook hands.</p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_63"/>
                        <p>Although it was a warm spring day there was a fire crackling in the
                            fireplace and after a few moments of standing around the President asked
                            us to sit down. His first question to <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Ellsworth Bunker</persName> was, “How do you like working with
                            Sol?” <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> told him how much he
                            liked the idea and said that he was pleased that we were in harness
                            together. I told the President that <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> had been my mentor and that we therefore had an
                            especially personal relationship. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> endorsed that warmly and the President seemed
                            pleased.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked what were the prospects for a new Treaty and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> told him about the
                            main problem being the defense-security one. The President made quite
                            clear that if there were not a proper provision for defense and
                            neutrality after the year 2000 the Treaty would not be approved by the
                            Senate even if he himself signed it. He then asked what were the
                            toughest issues and again <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                            talked about defense and security and I added a word about the Zonians
                            and the matter of compensation.</p>
                        <p>The President wanted to know what the effect would be of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAE_1">Boyd</persName>’s resignation as Foreign Minister
                            and I pointed out that one possible favorable interpretation would be
                            that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> might smell a new
                            Treaty developing and wanted his own name on it rather than that of

                            said, “You don’t have to worry about that with me. I would be perfectly
                            willing to have it the <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            Treaty.”</p>
                        <p>I talked a bit to the President then about payments to the Panamanians
                            and the situation with reference to the tolls which had already been
                            raised twice recently. He asked what the cost was for a ton through the
                            Canal in light of the charge of $1.29 per Panama ton. I pointed out that
                            the cost generally included all the costs of the Zone and he indicated
                            that perhaps this was “unfair”.</p>
                        <p>I then mentioned to the President that it was possible that we might
                            reach an impasse in the negotiations and in that event a letter from him
                            to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> might be helpful for
                            us to have. I then read to him a proposed letter which I had written out
                            shortly before coming to the meeting. He found it acceptable and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked for it so
                            that he could have it prepared and signed by the President. The
                            President said that in the light of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>’ interest in obtaining recognition he might be
                            pleased to have the President suggest that <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                            signing the Treaty together and he asked <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> to add that to the letter.<note n="3"

                                will be fair, reasonable and appropriate in every respect.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> assured <persName
                                    corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> that the United States
                                intended to “proceed in a cooperative and flexible spirit in the

                                proper concerns of both Panama and the United States.” If the treaty
                                negotiations were successful, and “as a sign of our friendship and
                                determination to place our relations on a firm basis, it might be
                                fitting for us to meet and sign the treaty jointly,” <persName

                        </p>
                        <p>With reference to the new Treaty itself the President made clear several
                            times that he believes that it is vitally important to us and that after
                            signature he would do everything he could to assure that it got
                            ratification by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to say that if we thought it were necessary for him to
                            come in at any time to talk to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> or otherwise, he stood ready to do so and to be
                            of help in any other way he might. Similarly, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy Vance</persName>, who joined us later
                            indicated that he, too, would be available in any way that it might be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>At that point the President was briefly interrupted to be told that his
                            mother had been suggested to go to India as his representative with his
                            son, Chip, to attend the funeral of the President of India. He then
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> for his reaction and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> thought it was fine
                            and said he would assure proper protection and inform Mrs. Carter.</p>
                        <p>I then took a moment to say to the President that it seemed to us that a
                            citizens committee for support of the Treaty would be a good and,
                            indeed, a necessary move. I pointed out that we could get someone like
                            Dean Rusk or Admiral Zumwalt<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">A reference to
                                Elmo R. “Bud” Zumwalt, Chief of Naval operations, July 1970–June

                            that I had talked to Zumwalt. The President responded quite favorably
                            and seemed to react especially to the suggestion that Dean Rusk would
                            take it on.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving I asked him what we might tell the press about the meeting
                            and he suggested that it would be appropriate to say that we talked over
                            the main points of the proposed negotiations and that the prospects for
                            a Treaty were good.</p>
                        <p>I found the President extraordinarily well informed on the Treaty
                            negotiations, confident, informal and in excellent spirit. He seemed,
                            indeed, to look presidential and acted as if he were perfectly
                            comfortable to be occupying the post of President of the United
                            States.</p>

                                >Bunker</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> on the occasion of your visit to Contadora
                            Island. We expect Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> will enjoy his stay here. We already know
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> enjoys his
                            visits. I have had the honor to participate in many of these meetings
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, and I
                            want to give new recognition to the positive attitude he has always
                            shown in the negotiations between our two countries. I wish to express
                            to you that we are grateful for your presence here as well as for the
                            declarations that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> has made, and we sincerely hope that this round
                            will be the most fruitful one between our two countries. We are
                            convinced that you have arrived here with this purpose and I can assure
                            you that our side also shares the same purpose. With these words of
                            salutation, I would like to end my remarks and listen to the
                            distinguished representatives of the United States Delegation. Thank

                            very pleased to be here. We are colleagues and old friends and have
                            worked together on many things over a number of years. Because we want
                            to achieve an agreement on a new treaty we felt it would be useful to
                            hold this preliminary talk before our session this morning to explain
                            our concerns and our views. We feel this will facilitate agreement. We
                            want to inform you about the procedures we would like to suggest and we
                            would like to hear how you feel about these procedures.</p>

                            the conclusion of a treaty. However, he is also concerned that such a
                            treaty should be on a basis that will protect your interests as well as
                            the interests of the United States. These interests, as I stated in my

                            which is as large as the United States has to fend for itself in order
                            to provide for its own security and cannot depend on someone else for
                            its own security. Any agreement must protect your interests and the
                            United States interests. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> and I talked to the President. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> knows the President
                            very well, and he will explain to you how he sees the matters before
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: First, let
                            me tell you that it was a deep honor to be asked by the President to
                            join Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> in the
                            negotiations. I share with most Americans great respect and admiration
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and as a
                            friend and admirer I feel it is a great responsibility to join him in
                            these talks. Perhaps you already know, without me further protesting the
                            point, of my friendship for Panama and of my desire to see a new Canal
                            treaty. I want to say this first to establish my credentials as a friend
                            of Panama. In this context, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> suggested, I will offer you my views on the
                            problems and issues we face as well as on President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s attitudes and position.</p>
                        <p>I had an opportunity to discuss the matter with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> both during the campaign and
                            since the campaign ended. I can assure you, like Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has stated, that we are seeking
                            a new Panama Canal treaty which is fair and equitable and which meets
                            both the interests of the United States and Panama. I can also tell you
                            that the President feels that he is under an obligation not to approve a
                            treaty that does not have adequate protection for the long-term interest
                            of the United States. He will not sign a treaty that will not be
                            ratified by the Senate. It is clear that he feels a responsibility
                            toward the people of the United States to work in a cooperative manner
                            to achieve a new treaty which is fair and properly meets the needs of
                            Panama and fairly meets the needs of the United States. With this in
                            mind he asked that <pb n="67" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_67"/>I convey to
                            you that what we seek in the negotiations is not confrontation but
                            cooperation. What we seek in the negotiations is an effort to
                            cooperatively meet our mutual needs. We need your help in reaching an
                            agreement that will be approved by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and will be ratified by the
                            Senate. If this is not achieved, there will be no treaty. Unless we
                            understand this, both our sides would be working to our disadvantage.
                            One more thing I would like to state, in this same spirit of friendship
                            and candor, is that you should understand that it is politically costly
                            for the President of the United States to engage in a strong fight for a
                            new Canal treaty. The forces that in the United States have already
                            aligned themselves against a new treaty are quite formidable.
                            Politically, any gains are not internal gains for the President. He
                            wants a new treaty because he feels that it is both right and important
                            to reach one. However, when he asked me to come to negotiate, he
                            mentioned that he recognized the political costs, yet was willing to
                            bear those costs if the treaty reflects the objectives we want. In such
                            a case he is willing to make the effort that is required.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: In the talks
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> and I had
                            with the President before we left he said to us: “If you can get the
                            kind of treaty which satisfies Panama’s aspirations and <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> security interests, I will go all out in
                            support of such a treaty.”</p>
                        <p>I think we are aware of your aspirations. You have made clear how you
                            feel about the matter of duration, a matter which is tied up to the
                            question of adequate neutrality guarantees for the United States and to
                            arrangements for post-treaty defense of the Canal. These, from our point
                            of view, are as important to us as the matter of duration is to you.</p>
                        <p>I thought it would be useful before we go into the formal talks to have
                            this informal exchange to tell you about our fundamental concerns in the
                            interest of making greater progress, progress which I hope we can
                            achieve during this session. I did wish to make clear to you where our
                            concerns lie.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: With this in
                            mind, it is that we are proposing, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> indicated earlier, that we leave
                            aside now the questions of duration, post-treaty neutrality, and
                            defense, and focus first on the other issues, with the intention of
                            making a constructive contribution, as will be set forth in our position
                                paper.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">See <ref target="#d17">Document
                                    17</ref>.</note> And that we leave for later the questions of
                            duration, post-treaty neutrality, and defense. I thought that you should
                            know about this in advance of our formal session. That is why we chose
                            this informal private meeting to tell you the reasons why we will be
                            proceeding in the manner I have <pb n="68" facs="0103" xml:id="pg_68"
                            />described and in case you had any questions that we could answer
                            before the formal session.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Escobar: I am happy that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> have both referred to this
                            issue because we feel that it is truly the “gordian knot” of our
                            problem. The basis for any progress in our negotiations is precisely the
                            determination of the term of duration of the treaty. During many years
                            we have been negotiating with the United States. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> can witness to the fact that in
                            previous years, when we were asked to meet the greatest security
                            concerns of the United States, which were to clearly establish that the
                            defense of the Canal would be the responsibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>, the Panamanian side worked very
                            seriously on this matter. That is the reason we reached the draft of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>. At that time we also reached
                            the decision that the United States would have the primary right of
                            defense of the Canal. That is also why we accepted to continue having in
                            our own territory defense sites and <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            troops. Both our teams have also been working hard with the purpose of
                            determining the necessary areas for operation so that guarantees would
                            be real ones. We also agreed that the operation and administration of
                            the Canal should continue to be under <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> responsibility. At all times during our negotiations
                            Panama has been searching not for confrontation but for cooperation with
                            the United States in order to find solutions to those problems which are
                            vital to both countries and important to the rest of the countries of
                            Latin America and to many nations throughout the world. I bring this up
                            so you can clearly see that the policy of the Republic of Panama, the
                            policy of the government, and the policy of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has always been a policy of
                            understanding and of seeking solutions to the difficult problems that
                            are confronted. Along the same line of thought, we also expect the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to understand what the vital
                            interests of Panama are. These vital interests of Panama are: to perfect
                            its sovereignty; to have jurisdiction over its entire national
                            territory; and to be free to direct its own destiny, as all nations do.
                            We honestly believe that the new administration that has assumed office
                            in the United States, led by a President who is looked upon now as a man
                            of great moral authority, as a man of great personal character, not only
                            by his own people but also by the people of Latin America, and I would
                            also say by many countries throughout the world, has in its power the
                            capacity to disseminate within its own country the truth about all these
                            issues in the assurance that the American people will be sufficiently
                            qualified to fully understand the situation. The people of the United
                            States have never been colonialists. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> has not been a country intent on subjugating other
                            countries. We feel that in the case of Panama, with the exception of
                            some groups in the United States similar to some we also have in Panama,
                            there is a general consensus <pb n="69" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_69"/>that
                            on this issue we should proceed with justice and equity. I would say
                            that what the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> people need to know is
                            the fact that we have already agreed on measures that will guarantee the
                            interests and the military security of the United States in relation to
                            the Panama Canal. This matter has already been established. The other
                            matter that we also have to clearly establish is that both countries are
                            committed to agree to a new treaty with a duration date.</p>
                        <p>Panama has already made political sacrifices in agreeing to: the draft
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>; the draft document on
                            defense sites; and the draft document on administration and operation of
                            the Canal.<note n="5" xml:id="d15fn5">See <ref target="#d9">Document
                                    9</ref>.</note> These have had an internal cost and have met
                            with considerable opposition among certain sectors of Panama. However,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, demonstrating
                            great responsibility, understood that this was the only way in which
                            both countries could advance toward the solution of existing problems.
                            He also felt that, in a certain manner, this could also offer an example
                            of how to conduct relations between such a powerful country as the
                            United States and countries in the rest of Latin America. Panama has set
                            forth a very reasonable term for the duration of the treaty. We feel
                            that a treaty to the year 2000 is very reasonable. Even Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> told us while we
                            were in the United States that he felt this was a reasonable term for
                                duration.<note n="6" xml:id="d15fn6">According to telegram 23441 to

                                Central Foreign Policy File, D770037–0895)</note> Upon reaching the
                            year 2000 Panama must assume all attributes inherent in a sovereign,
                            independent nation. After the year 2000 the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> should not fear for the security and operation of the
                            Canal because first, it is a basic interest of Panama that it be so, and
                            secondly, because the General has stated that a declaration of
                            neutrality by Panama can be strengthened, through the United Nations, by
                            all the countries of the world. If all the countries of the world agree
                            to the neutrality of the waterway, we honestly believe that it will be
                            assured. This will represent a greater assurance of real neutrality than
                            that which can be individually guaranteed by any one country alone. We
                            feel that the concept that the United States, after the year 2000,
                            should continue to have defense rights and a guarantee of neutrality is
                            not realistic, because it is unnecessary for a great power such as the
                            United States, and also because it does not conform to the manner in
                            which agreements between nations operate in the world.</p>
                        <p>I honestly believe that the administration of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, with the assistance of a
                            negotiating team of great intellectual caliber and a vision of the
                            future, can face up to this problem knowing that the <pb n="70"
                                facs="0105" xml:id="pg_70"/>concept of a need for a guarantee
                            extending beyond the year 2000 is not realistic and that it would be
                            impossible for Panama to accept it. No government in our country would
                            be able to present to our people a treaty with the United States that
                            does not place a termination date for the duration. I would like to say,
                            with all due respect to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName>, that the procedure in the present round should
                            be directed to the decision of the issue of duration of the treaty. In
                            our country public opinion is conscious of the fact that, if after 13
                            years of negotiations we cannot make a determination on the matter of
                            duration, these negotiations cannot continue eternally.</p>
                        <p>Though it is true that we face a series of problems in other related
                            areas of the treaty, a decision on the issue of duration would permit
                            both teams to work faster in search of a solution to the remaining
                            problems. Otherwise, no progress is practicable because we would be
                            working without knowing until when the arrangements would have to last.
                            I would therefore propose, with all due respect, that we try a
                            discussion in depth on this matter and arrive at a decision that is
                            clearly useful to end our negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I think we have
                            already recognized that Panama’s objective was to perfect its own
                            sovereignty. We have also agreed, in the principles,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d15fn7">The <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"

                            </note> that the treaty would have a termination date. We have gone a
                            long way, in the area of jurisdiction, towards perfecting Panama’s
                            sovereignty over the Canal. However, equally important to a country of
                            over 200 million people, a country which is the most powerful country in
                            the world, is to make sure that its vital interests are protected in the
                            Canal not only during the term of the treaty, but always. The Canal is
                            of vital interest to the United States. The matter is how do we
                            compromise your aspirations and our security interests. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> has said that there
                            are other issues that are equally important to us during the term of the
                            treaty. You have made a unilateral declaration on the year 2000. We feel
                            it is clear that agreements, adjustments, and compromises on other
                            issues are essential to the progress of our negotiations before we can
                            reach agreement on a date. We want to discuss these issues and find a
                            solution to many that are hanging fire and see if we can achieve some
                            progress. The issues of neutrality and post-defense arrangements are
                            vital to the United States. We cannot take back a treaty to the Senate
                            unless we can convince them that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            interests are protected. I personally think, and I believe Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> agrees, that we can
                            find formulae to resolve these issues if we address ourselves to them.
                            Let us meet on <pb n="71" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_71"/>these key issues
                            and then take on the matters of our interests and your aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I would like
                            to supplement very briefly what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> has said. We have both come here in a spirit of
                            cooperation and we want to ask you to understand <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> needs in the same manner as you wish us to understand
                            Panama’s needs and we want to ask for your help in developing a position
                            that may have good prospects of approval. It will not help the President
                            and it will not help a new treaty if we come back with a position that
                            we know is not acceptable to the President and to the Senate. We would
                            be doing you a disservice if we did not point out the risks of reaching
                            a solution that would not have a chance to prosper. If we go back with
                            an agreement on duration and we have not satisfactorily solved the other
                            key issues, the treaty does not stand a chance of approval by the
                            President or by the Senate. We have to deal with the other interests if
                            we are to serve our mutual interest to reach a new treaty. One more
                            word. You mentioned Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1"
                                >Humphrey</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and I met with him a few days before our
                            departure and he himself pointed out the importance of returning to the
                            Senate a treaty which, while taking care of your aspirations on
                            duration, deals appropriately with <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            concerns regarding post-treaty arrangements.<note n="8" xml:id="d15fn8"

                            You know that Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>
                            is very “simpatico” and he is aware of the aspirations of Panama. He
                            recognizes that if we try to help with your concerns on duration, you
                            also must help us regarding the other issues that are important to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Senor Fabrega: I wanted to say that we are apparently in a situation in
                            which we are trying to find out what came first, the chicken or the egg.
                            Ambassador Escobar has said that once the two fundamental aspects of
                            duration and defense are decided, it will be very easy to reach
                            agreement on all other remaining matters which would be part of the
                            treaty. It would be very easy to reach an agreement on all other issues
                            relating to the operation, maintenance, and defense of the Canal, both
                            with respect to the fundamental and to the practical aspects. We believe
                            that if we could get from you an integrated proposal, we would be in a
                            position to give consideration to it and to provide an answer to your
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Thank you for
                            your response Mr. Fabrega. We have first a presentation for you<note

                                asked.<note n="10" xml:id="d15fn10">See <ref target="#d15fn5"
                                    >footnote 5</ref> above.</note> However, our feeling is, and we
                            want to propose, that we deal first with other issues that are important
                            to the United States and then deal with the questions of duration,
                            neutrality, and post-defense arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I would like
                            to say a word in that connection. We understand your chicken and egg
                            dilemma. Sometimes I don’t know which is the chicken. It is not our
                            intent to place you in a difficult position. We understand what you must
                            have regarding duration, but we must look at our common ground to
                            achieve some progress. In line with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s remarks regarding our
                            presentation, it might be helpful in the discussions on the other issues
                            for you to make the assumption (without having in any way our formal
                            acquiescence) that we will deal properly with the issue of duration. In
                            this manner you would not feel that we are moving in an unrelated way.
                            It would help us to move forward if we discussed as if a satisfactory
                            solution to the issue of duration would be forthcoming, and later on we
                            will deal specifically with duration, neutrality, and post-treaty
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Escobar: The problem we have is that there are a number of
                            outstanding issues on which we have been working intensively. For
                            instance, the teams of Architect Fabrega and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> have been making progress in
                            the area of lands and waters. We have also discussed the problems of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> citizens working in the Canal
                            Zone. We have also discussed military housing, outside defense sites. We
                            have also discussed the status of defense sites and of military and
                            civilian personnel. We have even discussed issues unrelated to the
                            management of the Canal. The problem that we face is that we are not
                            advancing on these issues because we do not know the duration of the
                            treaty. We do not know until when such measures will exist and we are
                            simply speculating, thus simply prolonging the negotiations. We ask that
                            we should center this round on the solution of the problem of duration
                            because we are conscious that once this is resolved, all other problems
                            will have an easier solution. We can assure you that on all other
                            issues, we have had in the past, and we continue to have, a positive
                            attitude with a view to resolving such issues in a manner that satisfies
                            the interests of the United States and of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> public opinion. On these problems we do not have an
                            intransigent attitude. What happens is that when we get into those
                            issues we are working in thin air, because we do not know when the
                            treaty will end. The fear we have is that in this round, which has
                            aroused great hopes and expectations among the people of Panama and the
                            Government, as well as in the United States <pb n="73" facs="0108"
                                xml:id="pg_73"/>and in many Latin American countries, we will simply
                            limit our discussions to the status of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> employees in the Canal Zone, or to how the Entity will
                            function, or to the size of the Entity. Without denying the importance
                            of those issues, as far as Panama is concerned, they are all contingent
                            on duration. What would happen in practice is that we would sit around
                            for another round, during which we would reiterate our points of view
                            already expressed in October, and the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Delegation would simply respond to those points. It
                            would be just one more round in our negotiations, and we want to avoid
                            this because we feel that the new <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Administration is interested in finding an equitable solution and we are
                            willing to collaborate. However, because of our experience of many years
                            of negotiations, we know that in discussing issues of secondary
                            importance we are not defining the basic problems and we are
                            unnecessarily prolonging the negotiations. That is the reason we are
                            advocating a procedure that would center our work on the issue of
                            duration. Panama is not interested in causing harm or difficulties to
                            the United States or in losing the cooperation of both countries. These
                            are not negotiations between two enemy countries but between two
                            countries that have always cooperated and therefore no fear should exist
                            on the part of the United States. On the contrary, I would suggest that
                            arriving at a just solution would increase the cooperation and
                            solidarity between our countries as well as strengthen the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position vis-a-vis the other nations of
                            Latin America. We feel that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> Administration, with its present negotiators, has
                            sufficient authority and sufficient prestige in the United States to
                            assure that no <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen would dare
                            think that you have failed to defend the interests of the United States.
                            Because of your reputation, because of your prestige, because you are
                            known as just men, it is that we appeal to you to help us find a
                            solution to that which is a basic problem for our country.</p>
                        <p>Senor Fabrega: I would like to confirm whether I have understood
                            correctly. Do you indicate that we could go into the rest of the issues
                            always assuming that our basic requirement would be satisfied? In other
                            words, contingent upon the satisfactory solution of our basic
                            requirement?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: You can
                            proceed on the assumption that the solution on duration will be one that
                            you will find acceptable if we reach agreement; that is, you are not
                            committed until we reach agreement on <pb n="74" facs="0109"
                                xml:id="pg_74"/>duration, neutrality, and post-treaty
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Escobar: Does it mean that consideration of all issues in this
                            round will include consideration of the term of duration?</p>
                        <p>Senor Fabrega: Will we be able to cover all issues in this round?</p>
                        <p>(BRIEF BREAK FOR CONSULTATION AND COFFEE.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I want to
                            clarify to make sure that we understand each other. We believe that the
                            most difficult issues to settle are duration, neutrality, and
                            post-treaty arrangements and that if we both apply ourselves to the
                            other issues on a “what if” basis or on a contingency basis, we can
                            assume that those three issues will receive a satisfactory solution. In
                            this manner we may be able to work and find out how close we are. It is
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s charge to us
                            that we come back with a set of proposals regarding what is required to
                            achieve a treaty. In this manner we will be able to resolve as many
                            issues as possible and to define the common ground. We can discuss all
                            matters, excluding duration, neutrality, and post treaty arrangements,
                            on the assumption we will find a satisfactory answer to these later.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Escobar: The problem is that in October Panama submitted its
                            global position which included the problem of duration.<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d15fn11">See <ref target="frus1969-76v22#d137">

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> and

                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> is going to answer our October
                            document, it is very difficult for us to conceive how their reply could
                            possibly exclude precisely the problem of duration. We would like to ask
                            you whether in your presentation in response to our October document
                            there is an answer to the question on duration.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: There is an
                            answer and it is that duration is tied to neutrality and post-defense
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I think it
                            is fair to say that we will be in a position to put before you answers
                            to the entire range of issues even though our formal presentation does
                            not deal with duration, neutrality, and post-treaty defense
                            arrangements. However, after our presentation, we will be in a position
                            to talk about it.</p>
                        <p>Senor Fabrega: We will consult and we will call you to see if it is
                            possible to hold a meeting this afternoon.<note n="12" xml:id="d15fn12"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Who will you
                            have with you?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Escobar: Architect Fabrega, Minister Ahumada, Jaime Arias,
                            Ambassador de la Rosa and myself. We do have some advisers but their
                            participation will not be necessary. We have two who are working on the
                            subject of lands and waters.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: We asked
                            because we would not want to overwhelm you.</p>
                        <p>Senor Fabrega: We thought that once we had reached an agreement on
                            principles, our working group on lands and waters could meet with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName>’s group to
                            continue discussions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Escobar: I wish to express to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> that both Mr. Fabrega and I
                            will consider with <pb n="75" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_75"/>deepest
                            sympathy any suggestion regarding any meetings that you consider
                            advisable to be held only between the four of us. Sometimes discussions
                            with fewer people can make more progress, and we have authorization from
                            the General to meet privately any time we feel it is necessary.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: That can be
                            very helpful indeed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: We will
                            await your word regarding an afternoon meeting.</p>

                        <p>Following up on our corridor conversation, I am returning the attached
                                memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Not attached.</note> regarding
                            the Panama Canal Strategy, in the thought that you may wish to consider
                            it in light of the following developments and comments:</p>
                        <p>1. The resignation of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAE_1"
                                >Boyd</persName> may cause some changes in the details, if not the
                            overall approach, of our negotiating strategy. For example, I have heard
                            a rumor that the Panamanians are now talking about ultimate United
                            Nations approval of any agreement that is reached. This would be a major
                            complication.</p>
                        <p>2. It seems to me to be difficult and perhaps risky to have very many
                            conversations on Capitol Hill until the new negotiating team returns
                            from its initial conversations, and gives us an initial indication of
                            the current position of the Panamanians. It would be most unfortunate to
                            persuade some of the doubtful Congressmen on a given hypothesis only to
                            find that our negotiating posture has changed. You will know best about
                            this, but it might not be desirable to do more than general
                            backgrounding and “conditioning” until we get further information.</p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="0111" xml:id="pg_76"/>
                        <p>3. As I mentioned, I have reservations about the style of the proposed
                            letter to the President,<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">Not found.</note>
                            and as a footnote I might mention that the term “fireside chat”
                            apparently is a casualty of cold winter and fuel shortage.</p>
                        <p>In any event if you wish, I am inclined to think that there is time for
                            you to reconsider this package and present it to <persName

                        <p>The Panamanian reaction given the following day was very tough and simply
                            restated the old uncompromising position. They kept the <gloss

                            3:30 to 6:00, for the scheduled meeting. At that meeting, Jaime Arias, a
                            businessman and close friend of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>, made a short but very strong emotional speech.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> felt it
                            necessary to reply that <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName>’s
                            speech was unwarranted. He reaffirmed that the negotiators were there in
                            good faith seeking a mutually advantageous treaty. Ambassador <persName

                                the February 15 negotiating session a “brazen power play.” Both

                        <p>We have just returned from nine days of talks with Panama’s negotiators.
                            As specified by the Policy Review Committee on January 27<note n="2"

                            talks was to explore informally whether Panama would be willing to
                            satisfy fundamental United States requirements in the event that the
                            United States were to accept a treaty termination date of December 31,
                            1999.</p>
                        <p>Through this process, we hoped:</p>

                            <p>—to reach informal agreement with Panama on the possible outlines of
                                a treaty package, or</p>
                            <p>—to identify clearly Panama’s position on unresolved issues so that
                                the President and the Policy Review Committee might judge accurately
                                the remaining distance between our positions and make appropriate
                                decisions.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In any event, we hoped to place the United States in a posture with
                            respect to the negotiations which would be perceived as reasonable and
                            fully supportable in the international community.</p>
                        <p>As we have pressed forward to complete the conceptual framework for a new
                            treaty arrangement, Panama has presented a hard response. While it is
                            too early to draw a firm judgment as to the reason for Panama’s action,
                            our preliminary assessment is that it is a negotiating tactic. We

                            treaty duration, neutrality and post-treaty defense arrangements. Other
                            members of the United States Delegation considered more technical issues
                            such as the identification of lands and waters needed to operate and
                            defend the Canal and the form of the entity that will operate the
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our discussions, we indicated to Panama that we were
                            willing to explore all other issues informally on an assumption of a
                            termination date for the treaty of December 31, 1999. In that context,
                            we presented an initial proposal on the two remaining key
                            issues—neutrality and post-treaty defense—with these features:</p>
                        <p>—a separate neutrality treaty with no termination date in which Panama
                            and the United States jointly would agree to establish and maintain a
                            regime of neutrality in order that the Canal remain permanently secure,
                            and free and open to all world shipping.</p>
                        <p>—an addendum to that treaty containing a United States interpretation of
                            it as providing a basis for the United States to take unilateral action,
                            if necessary, to protect the Canal’s neutrality even after the
                            termination of United States control of canal operation.</p>
                        <p>—a mutual agreement to conclude, before the basic treaty’s expiration, an
                            agreement to facilitate United States participation in post-treaty Canal
                            defense.</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="0117" xml:id="pg_82"/>
                        <p>Panama declined to accept our proposal on the contention that it violated
                            Panama’s sovereignty and gave the United States a special responsibility
                            for the Canal in perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>Panama’s negotiators subsequently suggested that we attempt to
                            accommodate our mutual concerns by separating clearly the arrangements
                            for the Canal’s neutrality and post-treaty security. In response, we
                            offered for exploration a two-point formula. First, Panama would
                            guarantee to the United States the Canal’s permanent neutrality. Second,
                            the United States and Panama would conclude, prior to treaty
                            termination, a mutual security agreement to become effective upon
                            termination of the basic treaty.</p>
                        <p>Panama accepted the first element of our formula, but proposed that our
                            mutual security agreement be modified to include:</p>
                        <p>—a specific limitation to threats from third countries;</p>
                        <p>—a fixed termination date; and</p>
                        <p>—an assurance that there would be no United States military presence in
                            Panama after 1999.</p>
                        <p>We felt these modifications, taken together, essentially vitiated the
                            formula in terms of the protection of long term United States security
                            interests in the Canal and of the acceptance of the overall treaty
                            package by the Congress and the American people. Therefore, we proposed
                            that Panama reconsider, as an alternative, the initial United States
                            proposal on these key issues with the deletion of the addendum asserting
                            the unilateral United States interpretation of the neutrality agreement
                            as providing a basis for unilateral action in the post-treaty period.
                            (We did not suggest that this deletion would change our interpretation
                            of the provision to authorize such action.)</p>
                        <p>At this point in the talks we described the three necessary elements of
                            any treaty arrangement:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—that the United States could not accept a date for Canal operation
                                earlier than the year 2000;</p>
                            <p>—that a termination date of December 31, 1999 for United States Canal
                                defense could be acceptable only in the context of the fulfillment
                                of basic <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> requirements on the
                                other outstanding issues; and</p>
                            <p>—that the United States would require a continuing arrangement which
                                it would use as a basis for protecting the Canal against a threat to
                                its security from <hi rend="italic">any</hi> source (read:

                        <p>As the talks progressed, we continued to encounter an unwillingness by
                            Panama to proceed at this time on the basis of these three elements. The
                            talks concluded February 22 with presentation by Panama of a four-point
                            document and a personal message to the President from General <persName

                            the ports of Balboa and Cristobal would revert to Panama soon after the
                            entry into force of the treaty;</p>
                        <p>—a fixed term mutual security treaty would be concluded by 1995 (the
                            treaty would concern threats to the Canal from third countries only and
                            would prohibit a <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military presence
                            in Panama); and</p>
                        <p>—Panama would unilaterally declare to all the world the permanent
                            neutrality of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> made the
                            following points in his message to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—the United States does not appear to be in a frame of mind to sign an
                            agreement that truly eradicates the cause of conflict.</p>
                        <p>—signing just any treaty would give the impression of a solution, without
                            providing one.</p>
                        <p>—a treaty which would go beyond the year 2000 in any way would be a
                            trauma for the Panamanian people</p>
                        <p>—a plebescite could not be held in Panama on a treaty, unless it achieved
                            real gains for Panama.</p>
                        <p>—Panama could view other treaty issues differently if the United States
                            did not insist upon a military alliance beyond the year 2000. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said in the message that he
                            willingly presented these thoughts to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> because of his belief that the
                            President honestly desires to avoid the use of force in solving our
                            mutual problems. He later added a sentence to the effect that a Canal
                            treaty could be a model for the type of relations which should exist
                            between a large and a small country.</p>
                        <p>Panama’s presentation of these two documents indicates clearly that it
                            has hardened its negotiating positions. However, the Panamanian
                            negotiators attempted in the final hours of our stay in Panama to soften
                            the negative impact of their position by expressing the hope that we
                            would return soon and stating that we were not so far apart as their
                            presentations might indicate.</p>
                        <p>In our judgment, Panama is testing the United States under a new
                            President.</p>
                        <p>If we are correct, we believe our basic strategy for the next few weeks
                            should be one of applying pressure on Panama to be more flexible in the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_84"/>
                        <p>Specifically we propose to follow a strategy designed:</p>
                        <p>—to avoid apparent haste in seeking agreement while always demonstrating
                            a willingness to negotiate if the other side is willing to do the same
                            (Panama might interpret a sense of urgency by the United States as a
                            sign of weakness);</p>
                        <p>—to encourage Panama to perceive that achievement of its aspirations
                            rests in compromise; and</p>
                        <p>—to solicit advice and support for our position throughout the
                            hemisphere.</p>

                            cited, it is believed that the comments reflect the general reaction of
                            the negotiators and other high level officials of the Panamanian
                            Government to the latest round of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] the canal treaty
                            negotiations, “disaster,” in the form of a rupture in the treaty talks,
                            was narrowly averted twice during the February negotiating round. The
                            first instance was the initial representation made by the United States
                            negotiators. The Panamanian negotiators, believing that the inclusion of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> as
                            negotiator signaled a better understanding and acceptance of Panamanian
                            aspirations, were shocked at the tone and substance of the United States
                                position.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">See <ref target="#d17">Document

                        <p>3. The United States presentation, which was characterized as “hard” and
                            “coarse” by the Panamanian negotiators, provoked an immediate angry
                            reaction from the negotiators and from Chief of Government Brigadier
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Omar Torrijos</persName>. The
                            product of Panama’s ire was the “declaration of war” read by negotiator
                            Jaime Arias Calderon at a subsequent session early in the round. The
                            draft of <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName>’ diatribe was
                            pieced together jointly by the negotiators and <persName

                                >Torrijos</persName> as “enraged” during the drafting meeting. His
                            final orders to <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName> regarding
                            the delivery of the response were “Let it be hard . . . very hard.”</p>
                        <p>4. The second near-disaster came on the heels of negotiator Adolfo
                            Ahumada’s hard-line, ultimatum-like presentation on 20 February. When
                            faced with the United States negotiators’ reaction that the Panamanian
                            position was unacceptable, and that the United States team would depart
                            on 23 February, Ahumada wanted to call yet another meeting on 21
                            February. Fearing that such a meeting would cause a crisis, the other
                            Panamanian negotiators convinced Ahumada that the best course was to
                            await the return of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and
                            chief treaty negotiator Romulo Escobar Bethancourt from Colombia.</p>
                        <p>5. Meanwhile, over the weekend, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName> had briefed Colombian President Adolfo Lopez
                            Michelsen fully during a two-hour meeting in Barranquilla, Colombia.
                            When informed that the talks were in trouble, Lopez Michelsen counseled
                            that the Panamanians should make every attempt to avoid a rupture, and
                            that some point of understanding should be reached with the United
                            States negotiators. Upon the return of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName> to Panama, where they were greeted with the news
                            of the near break in the negotiations, both agreed that a more
                            conciliatory attitude was necessary. <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName>’s presentation at the morning session on 22
                            February put into effect that decision.</p>
                        <p>6. The proposal for the turnover of the administration of the canal
                            entity to Panama in the year 1990 was a decision made in the classic

                            1975, he ignored the fact that the other part of the “what if” was an
                            extension of the treaty’s duration and United States defense rights on a
                            20-to-30 year sliding scale, dependent on subsequent discussion.</p>

                            as of 23 February could best be summed up as difficult but at the same
                            time having some positive elements. The most important result of the
                            discussions was the presentation of a Panamanian position paper for

                            was not designed to negotiate but rather to explore the prospects for
                            getting a treaty with Panama. The Negotiators specifically wished to
                            respond to a Panamanian proposal of last October<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d22fn7">See <ref target="#d9fn8">footnote 8, Document
                                    9</ref>.</note> and to find out what Panama would be prepared to
                            do to meet <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> needs in exchange for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> acceptance of the year 2000. He
                            said the object was to get a clear understanding of Panamanian positions
                            on the issues and hopefully to come back with a firm idea of what it
                            would take to get a treaty. Although we didn’t get all of the answers we
                            wished we do have some idea of what the Panamanian positions are. During
                            the round we strongly emphasized that we were not prepared to go under
                            the year 2000, that we could accept the year 2000 only if our needs in
                            other areas were met and that we must have a treaty acceptable to the
                            Congress. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                            explained that the negotiations were complicated by the fact that
                            Panama’s expectations regarding the round had been inflated as a result
                            of several remarks made by the new Administration regarding the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> desire to secure a treaty promptly. He
                            said when the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> made its initial
                            presentation Panama was surprised by the firmness of our <pb n="89"
                                facs="0124" xml:id="pg_89"/>positions and reacted negatively to
                            them. He said that when we began to develop formulas on neutrality and
                            post-treaty defense however the Panamanians calmed down and began
                            generally to negotiate seriously. He said the Panamanians thought we had
                            hardened our positions which in some respects was true. We had for
                            example tightened up our needs in the area of lands and waters and had
                            indicated that because of changes in the operating costs of the canal
                            the amount of compensation that could be derived from tolls had been
                            recalculated downwards. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> explained that the initial neutrality position we
                            put forward called for a joint guarantee in the post-treaty period along
                            with a unilateral interpretation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            rights under that guarantee. Panama objected to what it considered the
                            perpetuity aspects of the proposal and also insisted that any security
                            arrangement could only concern threats to the canal by “third
                            countries.” Subsequently we put forward a number of other neutrality and
                            security proposals all of which Panama found unacceptable. In response
                            they made several proposals which we found unacceptable. At the
                            conclusion of the round they asked us to pass a letter to the President
                            from <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> which stated that
                            Panama did not believe the United States was “in the mood” to get a
                            treaty. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said
                            that his assessment was that Panama was testing the firmness of the new
                            Administration in this initial round.<note n="8" xml:id="d22fn8">See
                                    <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note> He emphasized that
                            this was in our view simply a tactical move and did not at all imply
                            that the talks are at an impasse. He said that in his view we should not
                            be in a hurry to return to Panama at this time but should be prepared to
                            respond when appropriate. He further indicated that the United States
                            would be briefing some of the other Latin American countries on the
                            status of the negotiations.<note n="9" xml:id="d22fn9">See <ref
                                    target="#d31fn2">footnote 2, Document 31.</ref>
                            </note> In that regard he said it was important in his view that we
                            should be in a defensible position regarding our negotiating proposals
                            with the rest of the Hemisphere.</p>

                                    >Linowitz</persName>
                            </hi> said he would like to amplify on some of the remarks that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> made. He
                            pointed out that really for the first time the United States had bitten
                            the bullet on the issues of neutrality and post-treaty defense—issues
                            which had been intentionally avoided in the past. He said it was not
                            surprising that the bargaining was tough on these issues but added that
                            the session was productive in the sense that both sides now have a
                            clearer view of each other’s needs. He emphasized that the atmosphere of
                            the round was one of searching for solutions in an effort to attain the
                            objectives of both sides. He said that he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> that the United States was
                            disappointed by the apparent lack of movement in the talks but that <pb
                                n="90" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_90"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> responded by saying that
                            in view of the complexity of the problem we should be content in that at
                            least we had made significant progress toward defining the issues
                            involved. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            emphasized that we had repeatedly stated that we could accept the year
                            2000 only if they were prepared to meet us on other issues. He said that
                            the United States side also stressed the need for the United States to
                            be able to take action to defend its security in the canal. He said that
                            while the Panamanian side understood our problem in this regard they
                            would not agree to any <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> unilateral
                            right of intervention or any arrangement that would be in
                            perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"

                            </hi> said that we had tried several formulas designed to assure that
                            Panamanian sovereignty remain unimpaired but that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> security interests were protected. He
                            said that the United States first presented a position based on the
                            “Brown-Brown” formula which was rejected<note n="10" xml:id="d22fn10"
                                >Presumably a reference to the neutrality and defense position
                                presented by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>
                                and supported by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"
                                    >Brown</persName>. See <ref target="#d4">Document
                                4</ref>.</note> (see page 5). The second technique which the
                            Panamian side found interesting was that Panama guarantee the neutrality
                            of the canal to the United States with the United States having the
                            right of redress if Panama was unable to abide by its commitment.
                            Surrounding this neutrality formula would be a mutual security
                            arrangement designed to provide for possible threat to or attack on the
                            canal (see page 5). It was clear that the Panamanian side hoped to find
                            some mutually satisfactory resolution of the problem and certainly there
                            was no impasse between the two parties on the issues. The Panamanian
                            side had countered with a variety of techniques such as offering a 1990
                            duration period but it knew that these tactics were unacceptable to the
                            United States. He emphasized that the heart of the problem was to find
                            some formula which would give us the security we needed without
                            violating Panamian sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>
                            </hi> said that he continued to favor a joint neutrality guarantee
                            without being specific. He said that inasmuch as we do not know what our
                            needs will be in 35 years there is great advantage in being purposely
                            vague. He also thought it may be harder to negotiate a more specific
                            arrangement. He said in his view the Panamian guarantee to the United
                            States along with a mutual security pact simply would not do the job. He
                            questioned for example whether the United States would be called into a
                            dispute between Colombia and Panama under a mutual security arrangement.
                            He said that with a joint neutrality guarantee the United States would
                            clearly have a right of redress should that neutrality be violated.</p>

                            </hi> responded that the Panamians had strongly resisted the joint
                            neutrality arrangement. They would agree to an arrangement in which
                            their consent would be needed prior to any <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> action but we wished to maintain a unilateral right of
                            action. He said that the Panamanians simply could not buy any formula
                            which implied perpetuity. With reference to a neutrality formula he said
                            the United States first suggested language to “establish and maintain”
                            neutrality of the canal appending a unilateral declaration in the treaty
                            of what that meant from the United States viewpoint. When they rejected
                            this proposal we dropped the unilateral declaration aspect but they
                            still found it unacceptable. We tried several other shorter formulas but
                            were unable to resolve the problem. They did accept an arrangement for
                            them to declare the permanent neutrality of the canal and some form of
                            mutual security agreement against attack or a threat to the canal. Our
                            proposal did not specify the source of such attack or threat, but the
                            Panamanians insisted that it be limited to attacks from third parties.
                            We emphasized that we must be able to counter a threat to the canal from
                            whatever source it came but were unable to arrive at an agreement which
                            would be acceptable to us and palatable to Panama.</p>

                            consent of both parties were required. The problem primarily evolved

                            Panama should lease the canal to Cuba. Would we regard that as a threat

                            provisions written into the treaty. He thought the original formula, the

                            </hi> said he personally was less concerned about a post-treaty security
                            pact for in his view the United States will do whatever it feels
                            necessary to guarantee its security depending, of course, on the vigor
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> leadership and the depth of
                            American support for such action. He said he was more concerned about
                            securing Congressional ratification of any treaty which didn’t
                            explicitly provide the United States the right to take what action it
                            determined necessary for the security of the canal. He said that in
                            recent days he had made several public appearances in California and
                            found more concern about the question of the Panama Canal than any other
                            foreign policy issue. He said this convinced him that we would have an
                            uphill fight in the Congress on any treaty. He emphasized that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> were fully supportive of the
                            President in getting the treaty but must be in a position to testify in
                            good faith to the Congress regarding the security aspects of one. Under
                            the circumstances, therefore, he said he preferred Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s formula, including a unilateral
                            declaration, which in his view would best provide Congress the
                            assurances it needed regarding continued <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> interests in the canal.</p>

                            consistently stressed the point that the United States would need some
                            satisfactory security formula for the post-treaty period. He said that
                            in his view the task was to see what could be done imaginatively to
                            resolve the issue in a manner satisfactory both to the United States and
                            Panama. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"

                            rights following the treaty. He said they must be persuaded that short
                            of some formula in this area it would be impossible to get any treaty
                            through Congress. He thought that the problem may be eased somewhat,
                            however, by the Department of Defense’s belief that it was difficult
                            under the best of circumstances to defend the canal against attack from
                            within Panama. <hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"

                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position which evolved over the past
                            year attempts to accommodate <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> defense
                            interests, the requirements for the operation of the canal, as well as
                            Panamanian economic and political needs in the lands and waters area. He
                            pointed out that the Negotiators’ position, as distinguished from the
                            official <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position, was based on those
                            lands and waters needed to carry out a combined <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Panama defense of the canal, a principle which had been

                                >JCS</gloss> support. He added that while the <gloss

                            it had received numerous comments from the Services, <gloss

                            and the Secretary of the Army. He pointed out that the Panamanian
                            response to our proposal had been received during technical discussions
                            in January and during the recently concluded session. He said their
                            January response was generally positive and that the map they presented
                            indicated significant movement toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> position. During last week’s round, however, he noted
                            that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> presented a somewhat revised
                            position reflecting changes recently received from <gloss

                            the Panamanians responded to these changes with a document called the
                            “Ten Points” which was billed as both a broad outline, or set of
                            instructions, for continued joint development of the lands and waters
                            issue and as the Panamanian response to our October presentation.<note

                            One is how the canal is to be operated including the problem of the
                            entity and the civilian employees. The second was the policies
                            surrounding the canal such as sovereignty, neutrality, and security. And
                            the third was the area of compensation to Panama.</p>

                            entity. He said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position was that

                            believed that we should not be under any pressure to hurry back. He said
                            that we were considering visits to other Latin American countries,
                            particularly those who had written the President on the matter,<note

                            that they must compromise if we are to get a treaty and that they must
                            bite the bullet on the issue of canal security. <hi rend="italic"

                            </hi> said that someone had made the point the other day that the Latin
                            American countries on the Pacific side should have a voice in the
                            establishment of canal tolls once Panama takes over operational
                            responsibilities. He said he didn’t know how this could be done but that
                            these countries were in tough economic straits without the canal. <hi
                                rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                            </hi> said that the Negotiators had in the past discussed the idea of
                            trying to include both Colombia and Costa Rica in some form in a
                            neutrality guarantee for the canal. He said there had also been some
                            proposals to include select Latin American countries or other principal
                            canal users, in some form, in the entity, probably as board members.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"

                            </hi> said that in his view the Negotiators should be authorized to
                            continue to explore with the Panamanians possible formulas for resolving
                            the remaining issues. He said it was particularly important in his view
                            to develop positions which we can justify to the international
                            community. He said briefing the Latin Americans may serve to put some
                            pressure on Panama although he acknowledged that this was a very
                            sensitive matter and must be handled discreetly. He said clearly that
                            the next moves in the negotiation must have the approval of the
                            President and that it was important to stay alert regarding the right
                            time to continue the negotiations. He said it was clear from the last
                            round that the Panamanians are very emotionally charged on the issue of
                            the canal. For example when they realized that their inflated
                            expectations were unjustified they became despondent and in fact
                            initiated several actions which were counter-productive to their cause.
                            For example they cancelled the scheduled session with the group <pb

                                17</ref>.</note> He said this emotional attitude indicated
                            insensitivity to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> needs but he was
                            confident that in time they would understand that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> positions were firm and they must handle
                            them realistically.</p>

                            </hi> said unfortunately too many countries viewed a commitment to
                            negotiate, such as that given to Panama, as an indication that we intend
                            to give in on issues vital to us. He asked if in the Negotiators’ view
                            further Presidential guidance was needed before the negotiations
                            continued. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"

                            be viewed by Panama as overt pressure on them. In view of the delicacy

                        <p>The negotiators said that they had clearly indicated to the Panamanians
                            that the United States would not be able to agree to the year 2000 as
                            the termination date for a Canal Treaty, unless Panama gave us what we
                            needed in the areas of neutrality and post-Treaty defense. Panama, on
                            the other hand, said that it could not accept a treaty which gave the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> the “unilateral right to
                            intervene” in its internal affairs or hinted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> would retain perpetual rights. The
                            negotiations <pb n="98" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_98"/>soon reached an
                            impasse. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said
                            that his interpretation of what occurred was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was playing to his domestic
                            audience. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            said that one of the reasons negotiations bogged down was because this
                            was the first time that both sides had really zeroed in on the three
                            critical questions of neutrality, duration, and post-treaty defense
                            rights. He also said that considerable progress was made just in
                            identifying the positions of both countries. Furthermore, this was the
                            first round of negotiations for the new Administration, and there was an
                            inevitable testing of each side by the other.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Neutrality: The Question of Ambiguity</p>
                        <p>The toughest question is whether we can find language which will be
                            satisfactory to two very different constituencies: The Congress wants a
                            continuing right by the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to
                            guarantee the neutrality of the Canal, and Panama demands an end to
                            perpetual <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> rights. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> suggested that Panama and
                            the United States could agree that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would issue a statement that we had a unilateral right
                            to intervene to protect the Canal. But there was no need for the
                            Panamanians to accept that. We can agree to disagree in advance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that he did
                            not think it would be a good idea for Panama to reject the critical
                            provision of the treaty publicly right after the treaty was signed.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that if we get down to this last point, perhaps
                            he could agree privately with <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that for the sake of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Congress, we would have to make a
                            public interpretation that gives us this unilateral right, and they
                            would not contradict our interpretation. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we could go even
                            further than that. The Panamanians do not have to agree with what we
                            decide to say, or even remain silent; they could even contradict us if
                            they wished.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the necessary ambiguity for the neutrality provision,
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> said that
                            a Panama Canal Treaty would be different than the Shanghai Agreement or
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolution 242 in that it would
                            require ratification of the Senate.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2"
                                >Presumably a reference to the Joint Communiqué of the People’s
                                Republic of China and the United States issued in Shanghai on
                                February 27, 1972. For the text of the communiqué, see the

                                pp. 435–438. For the text of U.N. Resolution 242 of November 22,
                                1967, which expressed the U.N. Security Council’s concern with the
                                situation in the Middle East, see <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the
                                    United Nations, 1967</hi>, pp. 257–258.</note> He said that he
                            thought that the more ambiguous the language the less chance it would
                            pass the Senate.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he
                            felt confident that if we could get a right to guarantee the neutrality
                            of the Canal after the year 2000, that <pb n="99" facs="0134"
                                xml:id="pg_99"/>he could sell the treaty to the Senate. He said that
                            he would be willing to talk with any Senators to the left of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJA_1">Jessie Helms</persName>, and particularly with
                            people like Senator <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> said that
                            we do not need to speak to <persName corresp="#p_HJA_1"
                            >Helms</persName>, but we needed to attract his audience. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that he thought that
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Harry Byrd</persName> would be able
                            to support a new treaty if he was briefed properly, and that Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Barry Goldwater</persName> has already
                            indicated his possible support. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> said that if we could get their support, it would
                            shock the extreme conservatives in the Congress.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Presence Beyond the Year 2000</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked about the
                            kind of military presence which the United States would need after the
                            year 2000. Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff indicated in a conversation the day before that no military
                            presence by the United States would be required beyond the year 2000,
                            and in fact General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> felt
                            that continued military presence beyond the year 2000 might well be a
                                disadvantage.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">See <ref target="#d22"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that he
                            had proposed on an exploratory basis that together Panama and the United
                            States would agree to establish and maintain a regime of neutrality and
                            to ask all members of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> to
                            subscribe to the provision. The Panamanians did not say no to this
                            proposal, nor did they suggest the United Nations as an alternative, as
                            they had once before. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>, who had earlier suggested the idea of having the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> guarantee the neutrality of the
                            Canal, said that his first preference would be to use the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> in the way that Ambassador <persName

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Visit With Other Latin American Leaders</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that
                            several Latin American leaders, like the Presidents of Venezuela,
                            Colombia, Mexico, and Costa Rica, had indicated interest in the
                            negotiations, and suggested that if agreeable to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, he and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> could meet them on the
                            President’s behalf to report to them on the negotiations. Since
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName> has already
                            invited Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and the
                            other Presidents had sent a letter to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> indicating that they consider
                            the negotiations a test of the sincerity of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that the
                            Negotiators could go there as a personal response on behalf of the
                            President to their letters. The President said we were fortunate that
                            our closest friends in Latin Amer<pb n="100" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_100"

                                >Torrijos</persName>, and he said that he thought the visits would
                            be a useful idea. He left the question of the timing of such visits to
                            the discretion of the Negotiators.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">See <ref

                            </note> The President said, however, that it would be a good idea to
                            make such a visit with a low profile and only after telling <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>. He said that we should be
                            very careful not to have these trips perceived as a way to apply
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>.</p>

                            would be firm, but also would state our continued willingness to

                            </note> Therefore, such a letter now would be very desirable. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> agreed, and said that
                            the letter should be a personal one and should include portions of the
                            previous letter.<note n="7" xml:id="d23fn7">See <ref target="#d25"
                                    >Document 25</ref>.</note> He said that the idea of a joint
                            signing of the treaty should be included in such a letter because it
                            would appeal to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> as well
                            as to other Latin leaders. After sending the letter, the Negotiators
                            should wait for a time and only after waiting, they should return to
                            Panama and negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The President also said that if the Negotiators reached a critical
                            juncture in the negotiations, and they felt they needed his help, that
                            they should not hesitate to call him directly.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> suggested
                            that a brief, informal and very private meeting between the Chief
                            Negotiators of the United States and of Panama should be held somewhere
                            in the United States—perhaps in a Miami hotel—just to get a better sense
                            of where the negotiations were headed. (Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> later suggested that New York
                            would be a better place, because of its convenience and because the
                            Latin community in Miami might discover it more easily.) He thought that
                            such a meeting at this time would be very useful, and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> agreed.<note n="8"

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> agreed that it
                            would be useful for the two Negotiators to meet with members of Congress
                            as well as with the press as soon as possible. Indeed, the President
                            said that they should treat their conversations with members of Congress
                            as conversations with the press, as it is likely to be on the front page
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> anyway. Vice President

                            suggested that they speak to Representative Tip O’Neil as well, and

                                >PRM</gloss> postulates an active Presidential role through
                            statements and meetings with the Congressional leadership. It
                            anticipates that State will take the lead in putting together a
                            coordinated Congressional program. With these considerations in mind,
                            the strategy paper sets forth the following guidelines for State
                            Department action:</p>
                        <p>—Develop a core group of supporters among the membership of both
                            Houses.</p>
                        <p>—Cultivate other Members who are inclined to support a treaty.</p>
                        <p>—Make a maximum effort to convince the many undecided but, we believe,
                            “persuadable” Members.</p>
                        <p>—Carry out a public information program targeted at those groups and
                            geographic areas most significant for assuring Congressional acceptance
                            of a treaty.</p>
                        <p>—Take the lead in developing a coordinated plan with <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>, Defense and the White House to assure
                            that the Administration speaks with one voice and makes effective use of
                            its resources.</p>

                        <p>We have already taken the first steps to put this strategy into effect.

                        </p>
                        <p>I share your hope that we might establish a model for the type of
                            relations that should exist between a large and small country. Our
                            common interest in maintaining a free, neutral and efficient Canal
                            should facilitate the establishment of such a relationship and lead to
                            the early conclusion of a mutually satisfactory treaty.</p>
                        <p>To make our common commitment meaningful, we will of course have to shape
                            a treaty acceptable to both our peoples. For this reason, prior to the
                            February talks I asked Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> to explore with your representatives possible
                            understandings on the major outstanding issues. The various suggestions
                            which we offered reflected a genuine attempt to search for a mutually
                            acceptable expression of our interest in a Canal open to all nations, an
                            interest the other countries of the Hemisphere share with both of our
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Our actions demonstrate our desire for a balanced agreement. Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> laid the groundwork
                            for our approach to the negotiations by affirming on January 31 this
                            Administration’s support for the 1974 Joint Statement of
                                Principles.<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">See <ref target="#d9"
                                    >Document 9</ref>.</note> These Principles contemplate early
                            transfer of jurisdiction to Panama, increasing participation by Panama
                            in the administration and defense of the Canal, and a treaty of fixed
                            duration. Although these important concessions to Panama have stirred
                            considerable controversy in the United States, we acknowledge them as an
                            important element of the treaty which we are seeking to conclude.</p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_105"/>
                        <p>However, if a new treaty is to be balanced and mutually acceptable, it
                            must both meet Panama’s aspirations and protect United States interests.
                            As I have said recently, my purpose lies in assuring that the Canal will
                            remain permanently open and of use to the ships of all the world.<note

                                said: “So, the subject of the negotiation now—it has been going on

                                would still be able to keep the Panama Canal open to the use of
                                American and other ships.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, April 4, 1977, p. 316)</note> The treaty should
                            provide for an arrangement which allows the United States to meet its
                            responsibility to operate the Canal during the treaty’s lifetime and
                            which recognizes our security interest in the continuing neutrality of
                            and access to the Canal after the termination date of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that the United States wishes to proceed cooperatively
                            to meet the proper concerns of both Panama and the United States. I know
                            that you will join me in working toward that end. To underline the
                            importance of the treaty and of the new relationship between our
                            countries, I will be pleased if we can agree on a new treaty and meet
                            personally to sign it on behalf of our two countries.</p>

                        <p>As you know, on 21 January the new Administration began a comprehensive
                            review of the Panama Canal negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">See

                            positions on all major negotiating issues, the status of negotiations,
                            and proposed <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> negotiating options.
                            They recognize that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> objective is
                            use, not ownership, of the canal and that a new treaty appears to be the
                            best way to develop the friendly environment most conducive to continued
                            uninterrupted operation of the canal. As a result of this review, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the minimum necessary <gloss

                            and availability could be obtained through a clearly stated <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>The intended objective of the latest negotiating round was to determine
                            what accommodation would be necessary to get conceptual agreement with
                            the Panamanians. As Tom Dolvin told you, that objective was not
                            attained, and at least one more exploratory session will be needed. The
                            negotiators are still planning to conclude a conceptual agreement this
                            spring and submit a treaty to the President by 1 July. You should
                            anticipate a series of rapid response requirements for information,
                            comment and concurrence over the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>The Director, J–5, is reviewing your unilateral defense mission for
                            possible revision, contingent upon a new treaty. We expect to have
                            definitive planning guidance on that for you prior to the end of March
                            which should enable you to make a thorough review of lands and waters
                            requirements based upon a combined defense mission.</p>
                        <p>The problems involved in shifting functions from the Canal Zone

                            greet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> and explain
                            the presence on our delegation of Minister of Education, Dr. <persName

                            have seen him at the negotiating table in the past, he has always worked
                            very closely with us within the Panamanian negotiating team. Not only
                            for this reason, but also because of his position in our government as a
                            member of the Cabinet, General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has sent him to the meeting which he considers
                            of transcendental importance. I also want to mention that Dr. Jaime
                            Arias will join us as soon as he arrives in Washington. At different
                            times during the course of our negotiations, he has played a very active
                            role, especially during the drafting of the status of forces
                                agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">See <ref

                            extending to you a warm greeting, I also want to tell you that we have
                            brought you some presents which we have placed on the table. On the one
                            hand you can see a turtle, and on the other some rabbits. Please receive
                            them as an expression of our affection. In addition, one of our purposes
                            is to perceive how our negotiations might proceed, whether at the pace
                            of the turtle, or with the speed of a rabbit. What you pick up first, we
                            will take as a message of your intentions and this should save us some
                            time. We are very grateful for your invitation to meet with us and you
                            can sincerely believe that we are very pleased to be here. It shows that

                            confidence, all the problems that might come up, with the purpose of
                            determining whether our two countries can realistically work towards a
                            treaty that resolves the causes of conflict between us, as well as
                            provide an example of how to conduct relations with the rest of the
                            countries of Latin America.</p>

                            great courtesy on your part. Regarding the question of the turtle and
                            the rabbits, we’re faced with two alternatives. The turtle’s pace is
                            slow but steady. Rabbits on the other hand, breed very fast. Maybe if we
                            followed their example in breeding more ideas faster, this could lead us
                            to finding solutions. I leave it up to you to suggest what alternative
                            we should follow.</p>

                            he told us that the General expressed his warm appreciation for the

                            letter. He felt that they would become good friends because both were
                            populists, and both share the same aspirations for the well being of
                            their people. We feel it was a warm and gratifying response.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> also reported that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had said that
                            apparently the Negotiators expected that both he and the President do
                            their work for them.</p>
                        <p>In our conversation with the President, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> and I had an opportunity to
                            present a good review of the issues discussed during the last round of
                            talks. We did the same with the Vice President, who is particularly
                            familiar with the requisites and the operations of the Congress, as a
                            result of his recent personal experience there. Both of them greatly
                            emphasized, as was reflected in the President’s letter that we could not
                            consider a treaty relationship that did not take into account the United
                            States interest and responsibility for the permanent neutrality and
                            security of the canal. They especially emphasized that this was an
                            essential element for Congressional ratification. I wanted to underscore
                            this before we take up the other issues related to the last round.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I would like to add my
                            own words of appreciation to you for your willingness to come here to
                            Washington to meet with us. It was a great pleasure to meet with you in
                            Panama and now here. I want you to know that I personally welcome the
                            spirit with which you are approaching this meeting. Our government is
                            also eager to move as expeditiously as possible to see whether we can
                            make some real progress. You must avoid what we did yesterday, which was
                            to fly high, without a destination. It is that same spirit that we share
                            in the hope that we can speak with frankness and in a forthright manner,
                            and that we avoid playing games with each other. Time is of enormous
                            importance to both our governments. I have said so before. If we want to
                            arrive at a new treaty, the time to move is now. If we don’t make every
                            possible effort to arrive at a treaty that meets your needs and our
                            requirements, I am afraid that we will find out that the moment will
                            have passed us by.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason that I have a special plea to make: that we talk
                            frankly, that we make an effort to understand each other, and that we
                            seek what is right for you and for us, and that we do so with confidence
                            that we can find the answers. Let us seek those general principles for a
                            treaty that we can present to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> and to the high officials <pb n="110" facs="0145"
                                xml:id="pg_110"/>of the United States Government, and that will have
                            good prospects for success and approval and ratification.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>, how would you like us to
                            proceed with the issues? We could take them up from where we left off on
                            our last meeting. I might suggest that we start with what we call the
                            triad, that is the group of issues dealing with duration, neutrality and
                            post-treaty security arrangements. We could then go on to the points you
                            brought up regarding lands and waters. Also the question of civilian
                            employees. The question of the entity. You pointed out during the past
                            few meetings that there were certain matters of great importance to you,
                            such as ports, docks, the railroad, housing, common land areas, and that
                            kind of thing. Would you want to begin with the triad?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: As you already know,
                            because we have mentioned it during the course of earlier talks, and as
                            we have now been strongly reinforced since our return to Washington, it
                            is vitally important for the United States Government to reach some
                            understanding regarding the preservation of the continued neutrality of
                            the canal. This will make it possible to obtain Presidential approval,
                            and also Congressional ratification. If you feel that some thought can
                            be given in these talks to this matter, and in the light of General
                            Torrijo’s letter, do tell us what flexibility you can show, so that we
                            can begin to approach the kind of a deal that will take into account
                            your concerns and your needs regarding sovereignty and will allow a
                            positive response to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position. It
                            is then that we will be able to move forward, with flexibility on the
                            other issues. It is important to know that we can talk about the vital
                            problems before we talk about the other issues. Perhaps you could
                            indicate to us which would be a useful way to start.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I want to thank you for
                            your suggestion. I too believe that the only way to proceed, is to talk
                            frankly and honestly, as we have done in the past. The only way to move
                            forward is to avoid going around in circles. I think that this meeting
                            must have as its fundamental goal to arrive at political decisions so
                            that our respective Chiefs of Government may assume a realistic attitude
                            in the framework in which political decisions are made.</p>
                        <p>I believe that to continue discussing every issue by issue that lies
                            between us, without going into the central problem of our negotiations,
                            is a waste of time. We consider that what we should do, is to point out
                            with great clarity whether both countries are ready to assume the
                            responsibility for taking the fundamental political decisions necessary
                            for a new treaty, and whether each government can confront their
                            respective peoples and governmental institutions with those
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>I will try to be more concrete. The concern of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> delegation is whether Panama is in a
                            position to make the necessary political decision regarding the problem
                            of neutrality after the end of the treaty, and <pb n="111" facs="0146"
                                xml:id="pg_111"/>whether Panama has the capacity to make the
                            political decision to create the instrument that will allow the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government the power to defend the canal
                            against third country attacks, after the termination of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>From our standpoint, and as vital to us as the above is to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, is to ask whether the United States is
                            ready to make the political decision to return to Panama its ports, its
                            railroad, its lands and reduce its military presence, without reducing
                            its capabilities for the defense of the canal. Is the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> ready to make the political decision
                            that will allow Panama to assume responsibility for the operation of the
                            canal on the year 1999 while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            continues its military presence until the year 2000 when the treaty
                            terminates? I believe this meeting should frankly consider if the two
                            countries are in a position to adopt the type of political decision I
                            have stated and transmit them to their respective Chiefs of State. If
                            you do not have the capacity to do so, I think that you should frankly
                            state so because otherwise we are wasting our time.</p>
                        <p>If I may sound blunt, but I believe that the intent of this meeting is to
                            clearly determine whether we can talk about these basic issues. We
                            cannot make them dependent upon the discussion of secondary matters or
                            on the issue by issue discussion of other pending matters.</p>
                        <p>In other words, Panama can make the political decision on the issue that
                            is vital to the United States, that is on the matters of neutrality and
                            post-treaty defense arrangements. Can the United States make the
                            decision on the rapid dismantling of the Canal Zone and return to Panama
                            of its territory, without affecting the defense or the operations of the
                            canal? I believe, distinguished Ambassadors, that that is the character
                            and purpose this meeting should convey.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I would like to
                            respond by saying that I welcome your statement and your frankness and
                            that I will talk with equal frankness and bluntness. As you have done, I
                            will equally focus on the issues, and will place our ideas on the table
                            and speak with utter candor. We are pleased to know that you, on behalf
                            of the Government of Panama can make the decision and the necessary
                            undertakings on the issues of neutrality and defense.</p>
                        <p>On our part, as negotiators, we can assure you that if that is the kind
                            of attitude that is forthcoming, we can promise you greater flexibility
                            on the issues of the railroad, the lands, the ports and facilities and
                            other matters. However, obviously, we will have to submit whatever you
                            put before us to our higher authorities.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the defense aspects neither Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> nor I, nor indeed our political
                            leaders, are in a position to propose formulas that do not count with
                            the support of our defense leaders. On the issues of housing for
                            Americans, port facilities, etc., we might find satisfactory proposals,
                            but I could not personally suggest that we recommend to <pb n="112"
                                facs="0147" xml:id="pg_112"/>Congress or present to the American
                            people something that has not been endorsed by our defense leaders. I
                            can assure you that whatever you state are your requirements, we will
                            transmit. However, as I have said before, and I still feel very
                            strongly, the idea of the year 1990 simply will not work. I do not see
                            any possibility for submitting and obtaining approval for any date
                            before the year 2000. I want to make this clear, unequivocal and
                            definite. I would be misleading you if I were to suggest that we could
                            do more. For, in our role as negotiators, we have a sense of what is
                            politically feasible, within the authority of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government. If in that assurance you can
                            see possibilities for progress, let us attempt to move ahead. What more
                            can I tell you than what we have been told and what President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> himself has stated?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: That is a fair
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: We both understand that
                            this is an exploratory meeting. However, it is different in nature from
                            our regular rounds. This time we should attempt to explore the issues in
                            greater depth. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            has set your parameters, as General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has set ours. Yet in the final analysis it will
                            be the heads of state who will have to make the basic political
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>We are not suggesting that those of us gathered here today are going to
                            make an agreement or formulate the treaty. However we do believe that if
                            we follow the basic principles of the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Tack</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                                Agreement,<note n="9" xml:id="d27fn9">See <ref target="#d3fn10"
                                    >footnote 10, Document 3.</ref>
                            </note> as well as the threshold agreements<note n="10" xml:id="d27fn10"
                                >The Threshold Agreements are discussed in <ref target="#d3"
                                    >Document 3</ref>.</note> we have reached over the years, we
                            might be able to find the core of a possible treaty. We need to prepare
                            an outline that will allow our leaders to arrive at those basic
                            political decisions. Thereafter, the experts can take over and put into
                            practical terms the consequences of those political decisions.</p>
                        <p>For example, we have already submitted Panama’s basic position as
                            reflected in the letter to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>. You can see there our position regarding
                            neutrality and defense arrangements after the end of the treaty. Whether
                            we can deliver on this will depend on the solution of the other points
                            that are included in the position of Panama. To repeat there all the
                            points included on our position would simply make us lose very valuable
                            time.</p>
                        <p>What the members of the teams gathered here want to know is whether it is
                            possible or not to transmit to their respective governments a very
                            simplified draft of the questions that can be accepted and of those that
                            can not. We should know this before the next round is announced so that
                            we can see that the two countries have developed on these matters.</p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_113"/>
                        <p>In the context of the guidance we could provide I would like to suggest a
                            series of hypotheses on several issues, as a framework incorporating the
                            following concepts:</p>
                        <p>—That Panama and the United States agree on the necessity that the Canal
                            remain neutral, peaceful, and open to all nations at all times and will
                            consequently draft a provision that reflects that mutual interest;</p>
                        <p>—That regarding the security of the Canal after the end of the treaty
                            both countries agree that an attack by a third country would affect the
                            security of Panama, of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>, and
                            possibly of other countries in the Hemisphere, and therefore a provision
                            will be drafted to reflect the need for such security;</p>
                        <p>—That Panama needs to recover as soon as possible its ports, railroad and
                            lands, and consequently a provision will be drafted to do so
                            promptly;</p>
                        <p>—That Panama, within the provisions to be drafted will point out that the
                            transit of vessels will have priority in the operations of the
                            Panamanian ports;</p>
                        <p>—That we must see an appreciable reduction in the physical military
                            presence of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> in Panama, without
                            affecting the defensive capability of the Canal by the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>; and therefore a provision is drafted
                            to appreciably diminish the number and extension of defense sites;</p>
                        <p>—That it is necessary for Panama to achieve its economic development that
                            it recover a large quantity of its lands and waters which are today part
                            of the so called Canal Zone, and consequently a provision is drafted in
                            accordance with the proposal submitted by Panama in February of
                                1977.<note n="11" xml:id="d27fn11">A reference to the “10 Points”
                                proposal. See <ref target="#d22fn13">footnote 13, Document
                                22</ref>.</note> This provision should also include the additional
                            point made in the message to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> in the sense that the quantities of lands should
                            be reduced, especially those for military areas of training. The
                            quantity of land should be strictly what is needed for the operation of
                            the Canal.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the matter of the year 1990, I am frankly surprised by your
                            reaction. I think that what has happened is that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>, who has not been present
                            during the many years of our negotiations, has not yet familiarized
                            himself with the fact that it was the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> that proposed to end the administration of the Canal
                            in 1990 in exchange for Panama allowing the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to exceed the year 2000 in matters of defense. So this
                            is not an arbitrary date, or one we picked out of a blue sky. At that
                            time we did not accept that date because <pb n="114" facs="0149"
                                xml:id="pg_114"/>Panama did not want a security pact which would
                            grant the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> defense rights beyond the
                            year 2000.<note n="12" xml:id="d27fn12">See <ref target="#d3fn23"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Regarding the year 1990
                            you will recollect that it was made as a “what if” proposal. However it
                            was coupled with a defense period that was not acceptable to Panama, and
                            it was later withdrawn by us. It is no longer on the negotiating
                            table.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: First I would like to
                            comment on the careful analysis of Ambassador Escobar. I think it is a
                            good suggestion to see if we can agree on some basic principles, to be
                            implemented later by the experts, and see if we can provide the
                            framework of a treaty. I must say here that we have to work out
                            something that has some prospects of approval, using our best judgment
                            and the instructions we have received. My problem is how to deal with
                            the general principles when, in the final analysis, they will require
                            careful delineation if they are to be meaningful, instead of broad
                            statements and open questions.</p>
                        <p>For example, you talk about the need to recover the ports, railroad,
                            lands, etc., and yet my study of past negotiations shows that a great
                            deal of progress has been made through the cooperation of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Panamanian representatives in
                            finding solutions to the transfer of a number of facilities and
                            installations. As I have said before, and I repeat now, we are willing
                            to show a cooperative attitude and see if we can find more possible
                            areas of flexibility and of some give in our part. However, I would
                            mislead you if I were to tell you that it would be possible to transfer
                            all of the port of Balboa. That is not what I understand. We will need
                            further discussions to determine that areas in the port of Balboa can
                            still be the subject of earlier transfers. I am afraid that general
                            principles without specifics would only put off a solution.</p>
                        <p>Regarding duration and neutrality I think that the formulation of general
                            principles can be very useful. Since the last time we met, I have
                            devoted considerable time, and have spent over one hundred hours in
                            consultations trying to figure out a solution to the issues of duration,
                            neutrality and post treaty defense arrangements, in a manner that will
                            permit us to say to our people that we have done what is required, and
                            that will also permit you to say that Panama’s position with respect to
                            its sovereignty has not been affected. With this in mind I want to see
                            if we can try the following solution to the problem of neutrality. It
                            consists of three points:</p>
                        <p>First: Panama, a territorial sovereign, will declare the Canal
                            permanently neutral. This is a principle that you always wanted.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_115"/>
                        <p>Second: After the termination of the treaty on the Canal, only Panamanian
                            troops shall remain in Panama, unless Panama and the United States
                            should otherwise agree.</p>
                        <p>Third: On the starting date of the new treaty, Panama and the United
                            States would commit themselves to a regime of neutrality which shall be
                            maintained in order that the Canal remain secure, free and open.</p>
                        <p>That would permit you an interpretation of how you wish to see it done.
                            And you know the way we will interpret it regarding post treaty
                            neutrality. If you could agree on such a formulation I feel we could
                            make progress because I have some confidence that we could get the
                            required approval. Maybe also in some other areas we could find general
                            language that could bring us closer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I might add, in addition
                            to the points made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName>, that any outline we might prepare would have
                            to include other points that are of great importance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> For instance, the matter of the rights
                            of civilian employees is of great importance to us and to Congress. It
                            would need to be spelled out after careful negotiation, and it is a
                            subject that we have not approached yet. There is also the question the
                            entity and the operation of the Canal during the term of the treaty. It
                            is these kinds of areas, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> has said, that will require concrete
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I think Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> has made a correct
                            evaluation in the sense that we should become more concrete each time we
                            deal with the different issues, so that our heads of state are in a
                            better position to study and decide these matters.</p>
                        <p>I also think that the tentative proposal you have made specifically
                            regarding the concept of neutrality is of the kind that we must submit
                            to our head of state. In passing I shall note that we will study it with
                            all due care and attention.</p>
                        <p>We have certain difficulties understanding what is, and what is not,
                            vital to the interest of the United States. Yet we feel that if Panama
                            is ready to submit to its country those questions that will be difficult
                            for our people to accept, because they are vital to the United States,
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> should be ready to present to its
                            country and its people the difficult issues because they are vital to
                            Panama. This is the only way in which these negotiations can progress.
                            For example, regarding the entity that is to be created for the
                            operation of the canal, it should be specified that it will devote
                            itself exclusively to canal operations, and not to any commercial
                            activities. When Panama assumes jurisdiction of what is now the Canal
                            Zone, it will own and control the ports of Balboa and Cristobal. Panama
                            will adopt the measures to insure that the entity, within the ports will
                            have operating priority to facilitate the transit of vessels through the
                            canal. Also at the time of the signature <pb n="116" facs="0151"
                                xml:id="pg_116"/>of the treaty, the railroad of Panama will become
                            the property of the Republic of Panama. The United States accepts the
                            proposal on lands and waters presented by Panama in February 1977 and
                            its attached “modus operandi”.<note n="13" xml:id="d27fn13">See <ref
                                    target="#d27fn11">footnote 11</ref> above.</note> The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will appreciably reduce the training
                            areas. The Republic of Panama will completely occupy Ancon Hill, and if
                            there are any instruments of a technical or military nature on it,
                            Panama will allow access without interference, in accordance with a
                            coordinated plan. The distinguished Ambassadors must realize that these
                            specific formulations are as vital to Panama, as defense and neutrality
                            are to the United States, and each country must face the resulting
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>There is no way in which we can go home with an agreement that is
                            specific regarding neutrality and defense, and yet is not specific and
                            concrete regarding the recovery by Panama of its territory. Regarding
                            duration to the year 1990, it is a matter on which I insist that we can
                            take it back to our respective heads of state so that we may continue
                            resolving the matter. If we could reach such a tentative draft at this
                            meeting, these kinds of specific formulations would be advancing our
                            purposes. I honestly don’t think it is possible to be specific on
                            neutrality and defense, if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> does
                            not want to be specific on what Panama wants to recover, which for
                            practical purposes represents the rapid dismantling of the Canal
                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I think that in pointing
                            out the issues that are of importance to Panama, such as the recovery of
                            the lands and waters, you do require further conferences and
                            negotiations. I have indicated that we could possibly do something
                            regarding the railroad and housing. Maybe there are other things we
                            could turn over to Panama in the areas of ports, but first it is
                            necessary to negotiate these things out before we can incorporate them
                            in the kind of document that you are suggesting. The document ought to
                            come closer to each side’s positions. We can’t present a document with
                            your positions and our positions, yet with further discussion we could
                            draw the positions closer. You want to recover as much of the lands and
                            waters as possible; we want the minimum necessary for the operation and
                            defense of the canal. I feel that we have come closer on this issue than
                            on the others. On the other hand, it is important to us especially for
                            the purpose of submitting the treaty to Congress, that we deal with the
                            rights of the civilian employees, which is a matter we have not even
                            discussed. We face certain difficulties, but they are not insuperable,
                            in developing the kind of document that you have suggested.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I would like to say a
                            word to better relate to your approach. First, it is not a matter that
                            we want to be specific on neutral<pb n="117" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_117"
                            />ity and yet remain general on the other matters. On the contrary, our
                            proposal on neutrality is of a general nature, and we will need to work
                            out the rules. We want to agree on the principle, and later fill out the
                            appropriate specifics. Secondly, if you understand what we are trying to
                            do, we will be better able to serve our mutual interests. As Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has said we could take
                            any sort of proposals you make and submit them. However, we as friends,
                            would not be serving our cause well if we did not discuss and explain
                            what is politically feasible. I do not favor presenting something that
                            is going to be rejected, but I will do it if you insist. On the entity
                            you say that it should be restricted to operations only and not to
                            commercial enterprises. Yet, who is going to determine what are
                            commercial activities? How is it going to be done? On the matter of
                            jurisdiction over Balboa and Cristobal, I know it is not going to
                            happen. Maybe some changes are possible, but not your full ownership and
                            control of Balboa and Cristobal. On the railroad, as Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said, we can talk.
                            There are possibilities for exploring the matter further. Regarding the
                            lands and waters presentation of February 1977 and its modus operandi,
                            we cannot accept it. On Ancon Hill I cannot tell you it is possible
                            because there are certain problems, but we can explore the matter
                            further. We are willing to hear about the year 1990 instead of the year
                            2000 but you won’t get it and it won’t serve you well to insist on it.
                            We can take up the draft that Panama wants, but I feel it would be
                            better if we could get closer, in order to obtain approval.</p>
                        <p>There are two courses of action open to us. We could list, side by side,
                            your position for submission to General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>, and our position for submission to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, and they can study
                            them and observe the differences. Alternately, we could try to narrow
                            down our differences. This is feasible, but we will follow whatever
                            course of action you suggest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: Regarding the first
                            alternative that each side present its own position, it does not make
                            sense. For a long time now we have both known what our respective
                            positions have been. The second method is more appropriate as long as
                            the approximation of positions is not exclusively on the issues of
                            neutrality and duration but extends also to other issues that are
                            essential to Panama. All issues that you claim are vital to you, are in
                            fact mostly secondary. This confuses the Panamanian side. You say you
                            cannot go to Congress without a guarantee on neutrality and on defense
                            beyond the year 2000 against attacks from third countries because they
                            would not approve the treaty. We understand that. But you also tell us
                            that you can’t go to Congress with the issues of the ports, the
                            railroad, Ancon Hill, the lands and waters, the commercial activities.
                            We really don’t know what you can go to Congress with, and we must say
                            that we are confused.</p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_118"/>
                        <p>We must insist on knowing what is vital to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> and what is not vital. In theory, neutrality and defense
                            are vital, and yet in practice, when we come down to it, everything is
                            vital. We fail to understand this. We honestly think that it is possible
                            to reach a closer approximation of our positions on these matters. In
                            the same way as you require greater specificity on the issues of
                            neutrality and defense, so do we regarding the dismantling of the Zone.
                            I feel we can do this with goodwill. If you need to undertake
                            consultations on these problems, we will keep in touch and see what the
                            results of these consultations are. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he wanted to see a
                            rapid solution to the negotiations with Panama, and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> also wishes to reach a rapid
                            solution. This is the real core of the matter. To reach a decision.</p>
                        <p>I fail to see why the ports of Balboa and Cristobal cannot be transferred
                            to Panama when eighty percent of the cargoes are actually shipments
                            destined to Panama and are not related to canal transits. As long as in
                            the ports areas priority is assured to vessels in transit I cannot see
                            that the ports are vital to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. I
                            must insist to the distinguished ambassadors that each time we get into
                            a discussion of this problem we enter into a vicious circle in which all
                            is vital to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. We wish to separate
                            what is vital to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> from what is
                            vital to Panama. I think this will bring us closer.</p>
                        <p>If you seek flexibility from Panama on neutrality and defense, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> must also be flexible on the other
                            issues that are important to Panama.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I have something to
                            say and I would ask you to listen carefully. We want to show a spirit of
                            flexibility to try to find a way of resolving the issues before us.
                            Among the areas we have explored, and which I intended to indicate to
                            you later, but that I shall present to you now to show how seriously we
                            are considering the vital issues and seeking room for flexibility, is
                            the following.</p>
                        <p>When we read over our proposal on neutrality we decided to say that we
                            will not insist on a mutual assistance treaty. If you accept our formula
                            on neutrality, we will not press for a security pact. I think that it is
                            a tremendous thing for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to say
                            this. We do so because we are trying to find a way which is satisfactory
                            for you and meets our needs. Regarding the railroad I think there might
                            also be a way to show greater flexibility. I hope that you will study
                            this approach that I wanted to bring up before we go to lunch.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Morning meeting was recessed for lunch at 1:45 p.m.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: Good afternoon,
                            distinguished Ambassadors. I wish to start this meeting by requesting
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> give us
                            an explanation of the concept of neutrality that could be in the
                            agreement that he presented to us this morning. We want this so that we
                            could study its full dimension and import. We would appreciate this
                                informa<pb n="119" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_119"/>tion and know that
                            he will go along with our request to find out in greater depth how he
                            conceives the concept of neutrality can be developed, its content and
                            its modus operandi. In other words we would like to know all those
                            aspects that he feels would be necessary to allow us to understand more
                            clearly what he told us this morning.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: First let me say that
                            I welcome this opportunity and that I am flattered by your suggestion
                            that my proposal might be more complex than it really is. It is simply a
                            suggestion which I have put forward in the hope of providing greater
                            simplicity, instead of greater complexity to our search for solutions. I
                            suggested several separate aspects that might be covered by a neutrality
                            agreement. Two of them are those which Panama has advocated; first a
                            declaration by Panama, as territorial sovereign, that the canal will be
                            permanently neutral; second a provision after the termination of the
                            canal treaty that only Panama will maintain troops, unless both Panama
                            and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> were to otherwise agree; and
                            thirdly, a carefully framed provision that would say simply what might
                            be interpreted as meeting <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> needs as
                            well as Panama’s aspiration, to the effect that “Panama and the United
                            States agree to commit themselves to a regime of neutrality (later we
                            would define the specifics that would have to be agreed upon), which
                            shall be maintained in order that the canal shall be secure, free, and
                            open to all vessels without discrimination.” Later we would apply the
                            rules of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>What this formula does is:</p>
                        <p>(1) It starts on the day of the treaty when the United States has primary
                            responsibility for assuring the neutrality of the canal, and for the
                            period after.</p>
                        <p>(2) It does not say by whom or how such neutrality shall be maintained
                            but it simply states the concept in general language.</p>
                        <p>In short the implementation is left for future discussion and future
                            actions, instead of for present delineation. I think, and I wish this
                            kind of language should meet what we understand were your concerns
                            regarding sovereignty, and also, I hope, our needs as they have been
                            asserted in this country. Admittedly this is general language but it is
                            for these general terms that we have a preference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: Could I ask you a
                            question regarding this matter with the purpose of gaining a better
                            insight into some of these concepts:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: Certainly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: Regarding the
                            neutrality pact, how would it operate vis-a-vis third countries?
                            Concretely, what would be the relations between Panama and third
                            countries specifically with regard to the declaration of neutrality?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I don’t know. The
                            point is simply that we are stating our mutual concern that the canal
                            remain neutral and we are committing <pb n="120" facs="0155"
                                xml:id="pg_120"/>ourselves to a regime of neutrality. I have not
                            thought out how it would be done. We are talking of the principle. There
                            are greater advantages to this general language. We are not trying to
                            foresee what may eventually happen in the future. The language simply
                            joins us in our commitment to neutrality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I have another
                            question. How would the neutrality pact operate between the United
                            States and Panama? What would its effects be supposing the United States
                            went to war with third countries?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I have not thought
                            about that specific case. However, what we are saying, is that the canal
                            must remain neutral and that concept is covered. We have assured the
                            neutrality of the canal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I ask for your
                            indulgence, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>,
                            in asking so many questions. However to better understand those matters
                            we will have to study I have another question. In the neutrality pact
                            between the United States and Panama would third countries only adhere
                            to the pact, or would they form part of the pact? How would this
                            operate?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName>: The questions we are
                            posing regarding the three points are due to the fact that they contain
                            different elements. First, a declaration by Panama stating the permanent
                            neutrality of the canal as a function of its sovereignty. This we
                            understand would be a unilateral declaration by Panama. Second, when we
                            say that only Panamanian troops shall be maintained, where would this
                            formulation appear? Would it appear as part of the pact or in the new
                            canal treaty?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: It does not make any
                            difference. The agreement would be signed after the canal treaty. There
                            will be another document on neutrality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName>: There is another aspect I
                            wish to clear up. Would it be a bilateral declaration? Would it be a
                            bilateral agreement?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: The United States and
                            Panama would enter into a treaty which would be a separate one from the
                            new canal treaty. In it, first, Panama as territorial sovereign would
                            declare the permanent neutrality of the canal. Second, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> would agree, (and this could also appear
                            in the canal treaty), that no troops would be stationed after the
                            expiration with the exception of Panamanian troops. Third, the provision
                            that I have read to you plus the rules of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Arias</persName>: I do not see clearly the
                            point that the second provision attempts to make. If we are talking of a
                            neutrality treaty or agreement, not one on defense, why do we need a
                            provision that no troops would be maintained? The rules of neutrality do
                            not allow the presence of such troops.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: OK. Because it is so
                            important for Panama we could include a statement to that effect in the
                            neutrality treaty as well as in the pact.</p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_121"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I want to see if I
                            understand what is being said. In the new treaty on the canal we would
                            state that there would be no troops as of the end of the treaty. Then,
                            in the neutrality pact, we would not mention this question.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: Regarding the
                            neutrality pact between the United States and Panama what would be the
                            situation of third countries? Would they simply adhere to the bilateral
                            pact or would they become parties to the pact?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: First, only the United
                            States and Panama would enter a pact. Secondly, as we have suggested
                            previously, and if it meets with your approval the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is willing to support it, the United
                            States and Panama together would sponsor a resolution in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> calling upon all countries to
                            subscribe to a protocol asserting that they will respect such a
                            neutrality. The <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> could also be the
                            depository.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I have another question
                            on a matter of great importance. Your ideas regarding any bilateral
                            neutrality pact between the United States and Panama are always very
                            clear. However, if any problem arose regarding the operation of the
                            canal, resulting from domestic Panamanian policies or actions, such as
                            those that might be required because of internal terrorism we understand
                            that it would be the exclusive competence of Panama to resolve such
                            problems and that at no time you would invoke the neutrality pact.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: With all due respect I
                            want to say that your question is precisely the kind of question I
                            wanted to avoid. If you are going to require specific interpretations of
                            the provisions, then we will require specific interpretations of other
                            provisions. I see no reason for the United States to have to move in, in
                            the future, as a result of domestic Panamanian matters but I believe it
                            is a mistake to try to reach clear language for each specific
                            circumstance. The reason that this formulation can be approved is
                            because it leaves open the possibility of interpretation to the future.
                            We consider this a great concession. We are not playing games here
                            tonight. We have put on the table what we consider is a very substantial
                            concession on our part. I understand your questions. Maybe our proposals
                            sound too generous. However instead of devoting more hours to further
                            discussion I believe that at this juncture I should make clear to you
                            that I am trying to inform you of what will be needed to obtain the
                            required approval. However if we start once again speaking of specific
                            questions we will be largely defeating our purpose and we will find
                            ourselves back where we started.</p>
                        <p>I want to add that you must look upon this proposal as a very substantial
                            indication of how far we are ready to move in order to motivate you and
                            to find out whether we can agree or not on this principle of the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_122"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>: I understand,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>. The problem
                            is that as these questions must be studied in depth by our government,
                            the more information we have the better we will be able to study these
                            problems and reach appropriate decisions. I feel it is necessary to find
                            out whether the neutrality pact or bilateral neutrality agreement would
                            require, in addition to a definition of neutrality, a series of rules
                            regarding the modus operandi of such neutrality. Logically it is
                            necessary to develop procedures once the pacts have been drafted. The
                            problem is what is going to happen when neutrality is considered
                            violated. This is the reason for my question. To determine the import of
                            the rule first regarding how we are to interpret that a violation has
                            occurred, and secondly, what actions are to be taken against the
                            violators. And here is where we get into the military problem.</p>
                        <p>We really did not consider it necessary to enter into a security pact. We
                            saw that a security and a neutrality pact were not only redundant but
                            even contradictory.</p>
                        <p>A neutrality pact does not present us with a problem. However the
                            definition of the rules regulating neutrality are what both countries
                            will have to agree on. Regarding these regulations we will have to find
                            satisfactory answers to the question of when neutrality has been
                            violated, by whom, and what action will be necessary. I have posed these
                            questions because our government will be asking us these very same
                            questions when we return.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>: I understand your
                            reasons and I must tell you first that I don’t have all the answers.
                            Secondly, when we were in Contadora we gave you a paper with the rules
                            of neutrality which also referred to arbitration and mediation, as well
                            as the kind of things that are covered normally under the rules of
                                neutrality.<note n="14" xml:id="d27fn114">See <ref target="#d15"
                                    >Document 15</ref>.</note> I hope that we are not trying to
                            cover every single possible eventuality. In providing you with that
                            paper we were trying to find areas of agreement regarding the rules that
                            would apply. We have not thought beyond those rules.</p>

                        <p>3. High point of session was Torrijos’s expression of his willingness to
                            approve some form of bilateral security guarantee for the post-treaty
                            period. In return, however, he said <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            would have to be considerably more forthcoming than it has been to date
                            regarding lands and facilities that would be passed to Panama under
                            treaty. He talked emphatically on Panama’s requirement for port areas on
                            Atlantic and Pacific sides. Underlining his desire for area adjacent to
                            free zone in colon for construction of a container port.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he felt only
                            sensible way to handle transfers of land and waters and facilities was
                            on a fixed reversion schedule. He said he needed to be able to point out
                            to his people that Panama would be getting areas of significant use and
                            value to them—some immediately, some in the year x, some in year y, et
                            cetera. He said he had the feeling <pb n="124" facs="0159"
                                xml:id="pg_124"/>that <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            negotiators did not as of now have the authority to make the kinds of
                            decisions that he thought were required to get a successful treaty. He
                            said there had been entirely too much concentration on quote trivia
                            unquote in past negotiating sessions. He told us what was needed was a
                            quote command decision unquote to move forward toward rapid settlement
                            of the major issues and the minor points would then fall into place.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName> pointed
                            out to the General that he was new in his job and had not yet had an
                            opportunity to look into the details of such issues as disposition of
                            lands and waters. He also reminded <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that he was not engaged directly in the
                            negotiations, that they were in the hands of our able negotiators
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>. But he promised the general
                            that he would promptly undertake a thorough review of the Army’s and
                            canal company’s positions on these matters to see if the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> could not be more forthcoming.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> welcomed this
                            pledge.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that he was
                            under heavy pressures for movement in the treaty talks. Above all he
                            said he needed to know if we really intended to press forward toward a
                            treaty or if the slow pace and indecisive nature of recent sessions was
                            going to continue. He said he would rather know that a treaty was
                            impossible than to have the talks drift along at a snail’s pace. Army
                            Secretary and I both assured him that it was clearly the President’s
                            policy and the expectation of the secretary of state and the negotiators
                            to work toward a treaty with all deliberate speed. We reminded him of
                            the considerable problems we have with Congress and with public opinion.
                            He said he understood those problems and appreciated their depth. That
                            was the main reason for his assurance that a satisfactory solution could
                            and would be found to the post-treaty security problem. He then reminded
                            us that he had major problems, too, which he hoped we understood and
                            sympathized with. We told him we did.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that if a
                            settlement was going to be prolonged, it would be helpful if the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> could undertake to make some gestures
                            to Panama in the form of transfers of some significant real estate. He
                            referred specifically to New France field and the Coco Sola areas.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">France Field was a <gloss target="#t_US_2"

                                Zone.</note> He noted with extreme puzzlement that quote the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> says it will give us the field but
                            wants to keep the hangars unquote. He said that was like his quote
                            offering us a ten-story building without stairs or an elevator unquote.
                            He also said that it would be much better if the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> were to take the initiative in this matter and take
                            some of these unilateral <pb n="125" facs="0160" xml:id="pg_125"
                            />actions. Quote, we don’t want to be in the position of coming to you
                            to beg for such things, unquote, he said.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that while he
                            was willing to make major concessions on security questions—during and
                            after a treaty—he thought the Secretary should understand his real
                            attitude toward this matter. He said that frankly there was no security
                            for the canal quote against two men or against a major power unquote. He
                            said every experienced military man understood that. He recognized that
                            this was a political not a military problem and it was one he understood
                            full well.</p>
                        <p>9. That was the heart of the discussion. There was a certain amount of
                            unrelated talk. For example, he praised President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> highly for his stand on human
                            rights. He said the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> should regard
                            the reactions of such countries as Brazil, Uruguay and Guatemala as
                            quote a compliment unquote. He also spoke of the urgent need for some
                            kind of worldwide approach to the problems of commodity trade. He said
                            he was considering asking <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary
                            [General] <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> to organize
                            some kind of international commission to work on a more equitable system
                            of commodity exchange between developing and developed countries. It was
                            clear from the context that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> principal concern in this regard is the
                            terrible bind that Panama finds itself in now because of excessively
                            ambitious sugar production. (He said the world price was eight cents and
                            that it cost Panama at least 12 cents to produce refined sugar. So, he
                            said, he was going to have to let considerable cane rot in the
                            fields.)</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> also spoke of his
                            unemployment problem. He said it was now nine per cent in Panama City
                            (we think it is higher). He said if it reached twenty per cent quote we
                            can forget about stability, about progress and about negotiations
                            unquote.</p>
                        <p>11. The talk was unusually candid and good humored. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was in excellent spirits and
                            though generally serious, he showed flashes of humor. It was clear that
                            he and the Army Secretary had established excellent rapport and that he
                            appreciated <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName>’s honesty
                            and candor. During the evening, in the midst of a reception for visiting
                            Congressmen, I received a call from the foreign minister who said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> wanted me to know
                            how much he enjoyed getting [to know?] Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName> and that he was thoroughly
                            pleased with their talk.</p>

                        <p>As you know, the Policy Review Committee meeting of 26 January on the
                            Panama Canal negotiations has resulted in an interagency coordinated
                            effort to conclude a new treaty this year.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2"

                        </p>
                        <p>You will recall that one of the principal topics during the meeting
                            concerned the need for Defense to participate fully in legislative and
                            public affairs programs associated with both the negotiation and
                            ratification of a new treaty. Accordingly, I have directed a thorough
                            review of possible <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> resources and
                            programs to ensure that we will be prepared to do our part in providing
                            to the public, the Congress and the media, information and our views
                            concerning defense interests in the Panama Canal.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>Our purpose was threefold:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—to explain the Administration’s policy and approach;</p>
                            <p>—to provide a United States perspective on the negotiations to two
                                Presidents who had previously been exposed almost exclusively to
                                Panama’s view; and</p>
                            <p>—to review the issues to the degree that each President desired.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>We made several general points:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—a new Canal treaty is a foreign policy priority of the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration;</p>
                            <p>—the United States is prepared to negotiate reasonable terms, but not
                                to sacrifice its continuing interest in the Canal’s secure and
                                efficient operation;</p>
                            <p>—Panama must decide whether it prefers a ratifiable treaty or a
                                continuing Canal problem;</p>
                            <p>—if Panama were to choose to hold to its unrealistic demands, the
                                United States would not be ashamed for the world to know of its
                                current position.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>We judge as a success this first effort to take our case directly to
                            Latin American heads of state. The Presidents:</p>

                                negotiations (presumably learned from their regular meetings with
                                    Torrijos);<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">In telegram 69426 to

                                    he thought it unfortunate that such an important matter as the
                                    Panama Canal was being handled as a bilateral issue between
                                    Panama and the United States, rather than “with other, more
                                    advanced countries.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                            <p>—expressed understanding of the need to provide for our continuing
                                security interest in the Canal’s neutrality after the new treaty’s
                                expiration but cautioned that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"

                        <p>The Working Group reached two conclusions which serve as basic premises
                            to its recommendations:</p>
                        <p>—Much data relating to the scope of operations of the Canal and its
                            ability to generate revenue under the new treaty is not available and
                            its development should be a priority consideration; and</p>
                        <p>—To the maximum extent possible, any transfer of benefits to Panama
                            should sustain from Canal revenue.</p>
                        <p>Based on these conclusions, the Group made the following
                            recommendations:</p>
                        <p>—that the Negotiators seek to create a technical study group to compile
                            information on the maximum revenue that can be derived from the Canal
                            operations under varying assumptions and examine the anticipated
                            reduction in expenses as a result of the transfer of responsibilities to
                            Panama;</p>
                        <p>—that the level and types of payment to Panama under the treaty should be
                            payable from Canal revenues;</p>
                        <p>—that the value of the Canal assets be calculated and recognized as part
                            of the total “compensation” package to Panama and should be considered
                            as a negotiating tool for the United States Negotiators;</p>
                        <p>—that the annual payment to Panama consist of an amount per Panama Canal
                            ton but should not be less than a low, fixed sum for a period of time to
                            be determined on the basis of mutual agreement;</p>
                        <p>—that an inflation factor should be built into any annual payment
                            position of the United States Negtiators;</p>
                        <p>—not to commit the United States to an overall economic development
                            program in the treaty;</p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_131"/>
                        <p>—that the United States not commit itself to a security assistance
                            program in the treaty; and</p>
                        <p>—that the economic arrangements of the treaty should provide for a
                            bilateral mechanism to aid the implementation of the treaty and the
                            Canal operations during the treaty.</p>

                            with <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Sol Linowitz</persName> who brought me
                            up-to-date on the Panama Canal negotiations. He said that he has made

                            the other hand, that the two Latin American Presidents and many people

                            needs a treaty if he is to survive politically.</p>
                        <p>Sol feels that he has broken the back of the most difficult issue, that
                            of preservation of neutrality in the post-treaty period with the
                            accompanying right of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to
                            intervene to preserve such neutrality. Sol has also been spending a good
                            deal of time on the Hill. His opinion is that it is going to be a tough
                            fight. However, he has recently won over such opponents as <persName

                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. Subject: Next Negotiating
                            Round.</p>
                        <p>1. This morning George Fisher contacted me by phone to say that Edwin
                            Fabrega wished to talk with me and would appreciate a call. During a
                            conversation later in the morning on a rather poor circuit Edwin asked
                            when we wished to get together again for the next negotiating round. I
                            replied that we were prepared, as we indicated during our luncheon two
                            weeks ago,<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">No record of meeting minutes has
                                been found.</note> to meet at a convenient time and place to discuss
                            all outstanding issues. I mentioned, however, that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> would be out of the country
                            during the last week of April and that after I had talked with Sol I
                            would get back in touch with Edwin later today.</p>
                        <p>2. Sol and I have discussed the situation and agree that the best date to
                            resume the talks is sometime during the first week in May.</p>
                        <p>3. I have so advised Edwin and have indicated to him that we must decide
                            later on the location of the May talks. I also repeated to him my
                            earlier observation that we wish to take up all outstanding issues at
                            the next round of talks. My intention here was to emphasize that,
                            contrary to the suggestion made by <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Romulo</persName> and Edwin during our March discussions<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d34fn3">See <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note>
                            that they would be prepared to resume our discussions only after we had
                            made a “political decision” regarding the lands and waters issue, there
                            can be no repeat no preconditions from our viewpoint to scheduling the
                            next round of negotiations. Indeed, our intention during the next round
                            is to move forward with respect to any one issue only in the context of
                            our ability to agree ad referendum on all repeat all outstanding
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to confirm my second conversation with Edwin, I would
                            appreciate your contacting him as soon as possible and repeating to him
                            orally the gist of the above, namely:</p>
                        <p>A. That we are prepared to commence a full round of negotiations sometime
                            during the first week of May;<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note>

                        <pb n="134" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_134"/>
                        <p>B. That we suggest deferring decision on the exact date and location of
                            the meeting due to some unresolved questions concerning Sol’s freedom to
                            be away from Washington during the first part of May; and</p>
                        <p>C. That it is our intention to discuss all repeat all unresolved major
                            issues during the next round.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A while back, you suggested that periodically we take a look at how the
                            current <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> negotiating stance is
                            viewed in Panama and elsewhere in Latin America. In sending you this
                            analysis, I hasten to point out the obvious—that this memorandum
                            reflects that range of views available from intelligence sources,
                            Foreign Service reporting, and the press. Our negotiators, of course,
                            can add another dimension.</p>

                            reporting and other sources, we believe that Torrijos’s present
                            perceptions of the situation are that:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> proposals always contain some
                                degree of “give” and, because the new administration wants a treaty
                                quickly, it will be willing to make concessions if pushed.</p>
                            <p>—Washington is under domestic and international pressure to be more
                                forthcoming; if it does not give in to Panama’s “reasonable”
                                demands, the justice of the Panamanians’ position will allow them
                                “to go to the world.”</p>
                            <p>—Panama has already made real concessions; so far the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> has failed to match these, and
                                nothing more can be expected from the Panamanian side until it
                                does.</p>

                            <p>—The remaining matters in the dispute are “political” rather than
                                technical, and final <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> decisions on
                                these issues must be obtained directly from the White House.</p>

                            conversation we have tentatively agreed the following steps might be
                            taken preparatory to our meeting with the Panamanians Tuesday<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d36fn3">May 10.</note> afternoon:</p>
                        <p>With respect to neutrality I will be prepared to indicate to the
                            Panamanian Negotiators that we are proceeding on the assumption that the
                            language proposed in March on this issue is acceptable to them but that
                            they have put forward interpretations of this language which they regard
                            as important to meet their own requirements. By the same token it is
                            important that they understand our need to interpret the language to
                            meet our own requirements in this country and to assure requisite
                            approval by the President and the Congress.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind therefore we want to be able to interpret the
                            neutrality agreement as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The United States is committing itself together with Panama to the
                            maintenance of a regime of neutrality for the canal. Under this
                            commitment the United States must be in a position to take such steps as
                            may be necessary to assure that the neutrality of the canal is
                            maintained against a threat or attack from any source.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d36fn4">

                                next to this sentence in the left margin.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would then go on to say we hope that Panama would find this acceptable
                            and would understand the reason for our requirement. In connection with
                            the endorsement by an international body, I would point out that we are
                            agreed that such international endorsement would be appropriate and
                            desirable but that in our mutual interest it would be better to have the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>—a regional body under the
                            United Nations—<pb n="139" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_139"/>providing for
                            such endorsement by the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> member
                            countries rather than by the larger and more complex United Nations
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to the entity we would indicate our mutual agreement that
                            the entity would be devoted to the operation of the canal and not to
                            commercial activities and that the issue is simply how to delineate on a
                            mutually agreeable basis the functions entailed in such operation.</p>
                        <p>We envisage, as we pointed out, a Department of Defense agency—the Corps
                            of Engineers or another—which would have operating responsibilities. The
                            Joint Advisory Board to be established would be able to deal with policy
                            matters affecting operation and we would be willing to propose a
                            Panamanian be named as chairman of the advisory board.</p>
                        <p>As to the functions to be performed by the entity we should be able to
                            put before the Panamanians the appendix which lists all of the functions
                            presently performed by the Canal Company and by asterisks indicates
                            those mutually agreed which are to be retained by the canal operators,
                            those to be performed by military authorities, and those to be performed
                            by the Government of Panama.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">

                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to employees, instead of referring to <gloss
                                target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> rights we should turn over to the
                            Panamanians the list of employee rights as set forth in the appendix so
                            there will be a clear understanding of precisely what we have in
                            mind.</p>

                            has approved the lands and waters presentation of General <persName

                            to be disclosed to Panama at the most propitious time. It may well be
                            that this should not be done until after the President returns from
                                Europe<note n="6" xml:id="d36fn6">

                                meeting. On May 9, he traveled to Geneva to meet with Presidents
                                Furgler and Assad.</note> so that it will appear to have been
                            directed by our “highest authorities.” If the Panamanians press for
                            earlier discussion of this issue we should continue to point out that it
                            will require the determination on the highest level and that meanwhile
                            we should continue to try to dispose of the other issues.</p>
                        <p>If we are able to make progress along these lines then at some point it
                            might be desirable to propose that groups of the delegations undertake
                            to work separately on some of the aspects. For example General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> and Fabrega might be asked to
                            deal with functions and later lands and waters assuming requisite
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName> approval. Dick
                                <persName corresp="#p_WRR_1">Wyrough</persName> and a Panamanian
                            designee could be asked to deal <pb n="140" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_140"
                            />with the employee rights aspects. Perhaps other areas for such
                            separate treatment might develop during the course of the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Clearly the object ought to be to make progress in every area where there
                            seems to be room for movement—including economic benefits. On this point
                            it becomes ever more important that we have a full analysis and report
                            on the kind of annual payment which is feasible under anticipated canal
                            operations, the toll increase which would be practical and acceptable
                            and the alternative proposals which could be put forward for
                            consideration by the Panamanians on this issue. I would think that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSM_1">Morey Bell</persName> and a Panamanian
                            representative could be asked to serve as a subcommittee to deal with
                            this issue.</p>

                            would have to be the year because that is when the President’s political
                            strength was greatest. Next year his political strength will not be as
                            great; the year after that it will be even less. Therefore, Dr.

                        </list>
                        <p>1. (S) It is the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a new treaty
                            which modernizes the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Panamanian
                            relationship and provides a basis for development of a friendly
                            relationship between the two countries is of significant importance in
                            insuring that the Panama Canal will continue to be available to the
                            United States when needed.</p>
                        <p>2. (S) After discussion and review of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> military interests in the Panama Canal, the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff have determined that the primary military concern is in use of
                            the canal, not ownership. Therefore, as a minimum, in order to provide
                            reasonable assurance that access to and security of the Panama Canal are
                            protected in time of war and peace, the United States and Panama should
                            agree in the new treaty to the following provisions:</p>
                        <p>a. That the United States will operate and have primary responsibility
                            for the defense of the canal through 1999.</p>
                        <p>b. That there be established in the treaty a permanent joint <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Panamanian guarantee that, upon
                            termination of the new treaty, the canal will remain open to all world
                            shipping at reasonable tolls, without discrimination, in accordance with
                            specific rules of neutrality agreed to in the guarantee and that Panama
                            would take no action that would hamper the efficient operation of the
                            waterway.</p>
                        <p>c. That each country commits itself to protect and defend the canal after
                            the termination of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operation.</p>
                        <p>3. (S) It is critical to safeguarding <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            security interests that the universally recognized historical precedent
                            that the neutral character of the Panama Canal is defined by treaty
                            rules unique to the waterway be perpetuated.</p>
                        <p>4. (S) With these minimum acceptable provisions, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> military interests should be adequately protected by
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> defense rights and military
                            presence through 1999, a sufficiently lengthy period of time to assure
                                <pb n="145" facs="0180" xml:id="pg_145"/>the formation and
                            institutionalization of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Panamanian partnership essential to the long-term <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> use of the canal. After 1999, legal and
                            political arguments could be made to support a unilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> intervention in the event any nation,
                            including Panama, threatened the nondiscriminatory operation or security
                            of the canal in time of war or peace.</p>
                        <p>5. (U) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the views stated above be
                            conveyed to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Negotiators by the
                            Panama Canal Negotiations Working Group in a memorandum substantially

                            negotiations. They indicated at the beginning of the conversation that
                            agreement on major points of the treaty could well be concluded within
                            two to three weeks, and felt it was important to begin briefing Senators
                            on the key issues <pb n="146" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_146"/>of the
                            treaty. <gloss target="#t_AMB_1">Amb</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> described the major points of
                            the agreement to date, including lands and water, and most importantly,
                            the neutrality issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AMB_1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> then gave a more in depth description of
                            neutrality which was clearly the issue Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> was most interested in. After
                            describing the neutrality agreement, Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> asked a series of questions
                            concerning the defense of the Canal after the year 2000, as well as the
                            involvement of the Defense Dept in the negotiating process. <gloss

                                >Linowitz</persName> told him that the Defense Dept was in perfect
                            agreement, and described in brief, the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> program for defending the Canal after the treaty
                            expires. He stated that the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> did not
                            want or need troops in the Canal Zone after the expiration of the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> explained he had

                            neutrality issue, which he agreed was the single most important aspect
                            of the treaty. Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> then
                            suggested that a meeting be convened the week of June 12 with Senate
                            Armed Services, Foreign Relations and Leadership positions in

                            We currently pay $2.3 million a year. We will probably offer $35 to $40

                            are to come from the Canal tolls. The need for some increase in tolls is

                            issues hinge on a “package” agreement on all issues (a hedge we also

                            Members will have solid arguments in favor of it before they return to
                            their constituencies for the August recess and (b) so the Members can
                            complete action before the 1978 election year.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Lewis immediately addressed the details of the negotiations
                            and made the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. A stipulation that American employees will be rotated back to the
                            United States after five years in Panama should be written into the new
                            treaty. (Note: The current proposal calls for rotation according to the
                            regulations of the Department of Defense.)</p>
                        <p>2. Panama wants the right to be able to choose the three Panamanian
                            members of the Entity’s Board of Directors.</p>
                        <p>3. Since the United States has the right to go back into Panama under the
                            terms of the neutrality treaty, the right of priority transit of United
                            States warships in times of war or emergency is superfluous and should
                            be dropped as a negotiating question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his pleasure with the May round of the
                                negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">See <ref target="#d36"
                                    >Documents 36</ref>, <ref target="#d38">38</ref>, and <ref
                                    target="#d39">39</ref>.</note> He was, however, disturbed by
                            some of the additions Panama wanted to make because he feared that the
                            progress already made in the talks could be lost.</p>
                        <p>On the question of economic arrangements, <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> stated that it would be very difficult to raise
                            the toll rates to pay for the package. Ecuador and Peru especially would
                            be disturbed. Panama needs a large economic package because it wants to
                            become a developed country with the help of the United States. It wants
                            to be able to count on the United States in this effort and therefore
                            wants provisions for <pb n="157" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_157"
                            />development support written into the treaty. Moreover, there are
                            certain aspects of the Canal’s operation which lose money. If Panama is
                            not a developed country when it takes over the Canal, it will not have
                            the money to cover these losses.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that Panama’s economic arrangements proposal “is
                            not in the ballpark.” To turn over the Canal and also to give Panama a
                            large sum of money also would drive the Congress up the wall. We have
                            relationships with many other countries in which their development is
                            generously funded on a case-by-case basis. We can handle projects for
                            Panama on a case-by-case basis, but a large lump-sum payment is out of
                            the question.</p>
                        <p>The question of economic arrangements highlights our political problems
                            with the treaty in this country, he said. This afternoon we were barely
                            able to block a surprise amendment in Congress which would have stopped
                            the negotiations altogether.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">A reference to

                                introduced the following new section to Title I of the bill, which
                                dealt with State Department appropriations: “SEC. 105. None of the

                            after the talks move a little farther, he would like to fly back to
                            Panama to talk with General Torrijos. He asked if he could meet with the
                            Secretary again before he leaves so that he can carry the Secretary’s
                            views back to the General. The Secretary agreed, since the negotiations’
                            momentum must be maintained.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">No record of the

                            approve any property transfers involved in a new treaty, as Rhodes
                            mentioned. The Executive Branch has taken the position, and so testified
                            before Congress, that since treaties are the supreme law of the land,
                            they are as valid a way to transfer property as legislation; and no
                            legislation is required. Some members of the House, especially the
                            subcommittee of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee with
                            jurisdiction over the Canal, have contested that view. Provided the
                            Executive Branch can sustain the principle, whether or not the House is
                                <hi rend="italic">in fact</hi> involved in the property transfer
                            question becomes a matter of tactics.</p>
                        <p>To insure that the House Committee does not lose jurisdiction—a point
                            which caused problems in 1967 treaty drafts—we have secured agreement
                            with Panama that the new Canal operating entity will be an agency of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government. The House Committee
                            would retain jurisdiction over tolls, labor relations and the like.</p>
                        <p>Your other notation—that under a new treaty the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> cannot give Panama payments exceeding profits
                            generated by Canal operations—accords with our negotiators’ current
                            instructions. There is likely, however, to be hard bargaining on that
                            point. I have conveyed your concern on that score to the negotiating
                            team.</p>

                        <p>We are enclosing a most important letter from four former Chiefs of Naval
                            Operations who give their combined judgement on the strategic value of
                            the Panama Canal to the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">The
                                letter from Robert B. Carney, Arleigh A. Burke, George Anderson, and
                                Thomas H. Moorer, dated June 8, is attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We think you will agree that these four men are among the greatest living
                            naval strategists today, both in terms of experience and judgement.
                            Their letter concludes:</p>
                        <p>“It is our considered individual and combined judgement that you should
                            instruct our negotiators to retain full sovereign control for the United
                            States over both the Panama Canal and its protective frame, the <gloss

                        <p>We concur in their judgement and trust you will find such action wholly
                            consistent with our national interest and will act accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> began by
                            expressing appreciation for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>’s personal interest in the negotiations. Its
                            result is a nearly complete agreement on major issues. The type of
                            entity and its components are under study, such as the manner of
                            appointments of directors and Panama’s part in Canal operations. Panama
                            has promised that the United States will have clear control of the
                            entity through the last phase of the Treaty. It will not retreat from
                            that compromise. But it wants a clear understanding about the increasing
                            participation of Panama in the last stages. This is not a question of
                            goodwill but of clear need for an agreement. The residents of the Canal
                            Zone are involved. Panama has made a commitment about their future. At
                            the table, the Panamanian negotiators are working to fulfill the promise
                            regarding their jobs but Panama needs to have an undertaking about the
                            training of its nationals.</p>
                        <p>Economic issues remain to be resolved. Panama has received messages from
                            the United States and understands its political problems. Next week, in
                            the meetings of the experts,<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">A reference to a
                                series of meetings on financial aspects of the treaty held in
                                Washington. After negotiations abruptly halted on June 17 in
                                Washington, Panama’s negotiators returned to Panama for
                                consultations with Torrijos. Negotiations resumed June 23 in
                                Washington. On June 24, <persName corresp="#p_BNA_1"
                                    >Barletta</persName> made Panama’s initial presentation on the
                                issue of economic benefits. Panama presented a three-part proposal
                                for economic arrangements covering the period of the treaty: (a) a
                                one-time lump sum payment of $1.02 billion at the treaty’s start;
                                (b) annual payments of $300 million for the life of the treaty to
                                support Panama’s development; and (c) $50 million for military
                                assistance of the life of the treaty to support Panama’s role in the
                                canal’s defense. (Background Paper on Panama Canal Negotiations;

                            the political process of ratification. Panama <pb n="161" facs="0196"
                                xml:id="pg_161"/>wants to discuss the economic issues on their
                            merits and reach a meeting of minds on the subject which later can be
                            made politically feasible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied to the
                            Foreign Minister’s opening remarks by saying that he thought most of the
                            major problems could be resolved. The question of directors’
                            appointments, for instance, was not a serious longrun problem. On
                            participation of Panamanians in the Canal operations, the Secretary said
                            the United States Government understands the position stated by the
                            Foreign Minister. But it recognizes language is required over and above
                            a statement of goodwill. This too the Secretary thought could be worked
                            out. He said the Foreign Minister showed sensitivity to the problem of
                            Canal Zone citizens, a sensitivity to the problem of ratification. This
                            too can be worked out, the Secretary felt. Economic issues now have been
                            raised. This is a tariff problem. There can be no payment outside the
                            Canal revenue. The Secretary had made this clear to the Panamanian
                            Ambassador this week.<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">See <ref target="#d49"
                                    >Document 49</ref>.</note> Projects on their own, economically
                            feasible projects, can be discussed by the experts next week but the
                            distinction must be recognized. Financing of such projects would come
                            from increased Canal tariffs. We assume that additional revenues will be
                            available to Panama as a result of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Revilla said he would speak very frankly. He had sat in
                            on the discussions in Panama in preparation of the economic issues. He
                            had his doubts about the level at which this problem could be settled.
                            The point was to lay good groundwork now, to understand the rationale on
                            both sides, to understand what is behind the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> point of view, and what is behind Panama’s point of
                            view. This is a critical point. The economic help provided by the United
                            States is related in a reverse way to the question of ratification in
                            Panama. If it would be difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to reach the high figure, it would be difficult for
                            Panama to accept a small amount. Panama requires a political
                            justification to be made. The Panamanian Government requires a political
                            justification for the people of Panama, just as the United States needs
                            a political justification for its ratification of the Treaty. Not too
                            many preconditions should be set for these negotiations. There should be
                            a broad look at the entire question.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said it was
                            important to understand specifics. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss>’s expert is coming to Washington for a meeting on this
                                question.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">Presumably a reference to

                                    target="#d52fn2">footnote 2</ref> above.</note> The object is to
                            get the facts, study them and understand the nature of the problem. If
                            necessary we could consider the higher level but only if we had the
                            details. We need the facts first. Ambassador Rosa said it was really not
                            possible to separate economics from the political <pb n="162"
                                facs="0197" xml:id="pg_162"/>aspects of the negotiations. When the
                            Canal tolls were fixed sixty years ago it was a political decision to
                            favor <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> transit to and from the west
                            coast. The economic aspects on that occasion were secondary. Considering
                            political over economic issues is not a promising approach. A fresh
                            start is needed. Tolls cannot be the basic issue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said the raising
                            of tolls substantially would obviously be of interest to the other
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> countries who are attending
                            this meeting. An excessive increase would be of political concern to
                            other users. This is a political fact of life.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> said the economics of
                            running the Canal must be taken into account as well. This is one of the
                            issues that the experts will discuss next week. Ambassador Rosa said if
                            we deal only with tolls, we are lost. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said it would be necessary to
                            take a fresh look at the whole question of economic cooperation. That is
                            why the experts are meeting in Washington next week. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said he was
                            encouraged that the Secretary was willing to take this broad look.
                            Political aspects are important but it is necessary to begin with the
                            economic rationale and then to go to the political aspects to reach a
                            consensus. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName>
                            said a distinction had to be made between economic projects that can be
                            fully justified and compensated from Canal revenues. For political
                            reasons, it would be impossible for us to seem to be paying to give away
                            the Panama Canal. Ambassador McGee noted that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> already understands
                            the Washington climate. He has been here for a number of years. He
                            recognizes that in the Senate giving the Canal back and paying too would
                            be unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName>, in response to
                            Secretary’s question, said the Minister of Planning for Panama, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA_1">Barletta</persName>, will be coming to
                            Washington next week. He is a moderate person. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> sat in on preparatory
                            talks on the economic issue. He knows a lot of work has gone into it and
                            it is based for the first time on the Canal revenue figures which Panama
                            has never seen before. He suggested that a formula would have to be
                            found for Panama’s participation in the operation of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that there
                            are constraints on our ability to phase in Panamanian participation.
                            Current employees of the Canal Company must be considered. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said that Panama
                            accepts the fact that the new Panama Canal entity will be <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> run. It will have seven directors,
                            four <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens, three Panamanians.
                            It is difficult for the United States to accept that Panama should
                            appoint its own directors but the Secretary as a corporate lawyer must
                            realize that majority rules in a corporation. The United States will
                            still run the entity with four <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            directors, but the Panamanian directors must be appointed by Panama.</p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_163"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he
                            recognizes that difficult problems are ahead, but they can be resolved
                            with good faith and flexibility. <persName corresp="#p_GN_1"
                                >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said Panama would do its utmost to
                            reach a treaty as soon as possible. He has been instructed to remain in
                            Washington for these negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that time is
                            indeed important but the ratification process is time consuming. We
                            would like to see the Senate act this year before a new election
                            campaign begins.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said we do not
                            want to see a renegotiation. After an initial agreement is reached, when
                            clauses have to be addressed for a second or third time, this would be a
                            step backward the Secretary said. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said that neutrality had been a
                            problem that we thought had been solved and then suddenly we heard that
                            there where more problems and now these have been worked out. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said that Panama had
                            been at a disadvantage because the negotiations were in Washington.
                            There were to be negotiations ad referendum. It was difficult to manage
                            these from Panama. Neutrality is probably the highest price paid thus
                            far in the transaction. It was clear that without it no treaty could be
                            concluded. It was a hard decision to come to terms. Panama now expects
                            the United States to make hard decisions.</p>

                            said that ratification would be a very difficult process on both sides.
                            The grounds clearly would be opposite. Today Panama begins the process
                            of ratification, the process of selling ratification to the people of
                            Panama. It has adopted a cautious line. It is anxious not to blow things
                            out of proportion. There will be a plebiscite in Panama. A vote for or
                            against the treaty and its alternative. Today the Government of Panama
                            has begun to present a case to the people to allow them to reflect on
                            their responsibilities. The Government of Panama will try to separate
                            the issue of the Canal Treaty from the internal political problems which
                            Panama faces. An objective presentation, of course, is good but it would
                            be difficult to sell the Canal Treaty to the people of Panama if they
                            thought it was too favorable to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that if the
                            statement of Panama to the General Assembly was excessively negative it
                            would give support to the enemies of the Treaty in our Congress. Last
                            week in the House we faced an amendment aimed at hamstringing the
                                negotiations.<note n="5" xml:id="d52fn5">See <ref target="#d49fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 49.</ref>
                            </note> We marshalled forces to avert passage of this amendment and it
                            was defeated. It is a <pb n="164" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_164"/>difficult
                            process but an excessively negative statement will have a bad effect in
                            the United States. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1"
                                >Todman</persName> said that talk about a great victory raises
                            doubts in both countries. The way to achieve the treaty is the way that
                            the United States has attempted to approach this: on the grounds that
                            both parties will benefit from the new treaty. It is bad to talk of
                            victory and joint statements help to show common purpose.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said we had made
                            progress toward educating a large segment of the American people who
                            have doubts about the Canal Treaty. Talk of a great victory for Panama
                            could turn that educational process around. He asked Ambassador McGee to
                            speak to this topic.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador McGee said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GN_1"
                                >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> had much experience with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Senate. He knew that in the Senate
                            there were a hundred Secretaries of State. Some combed the record to
                            find statements made in Panama that would be embarrassing to the United
                            States. They speak for people who favor reckless statements. We do not
                            have a two-thirds majority for the treaty now. Ambassador Pitty and
                            Ambassador McGee will not make speeches in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss>, of course, but it is necessary to avoid speeches in
                            both countries claiming victory for either side.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said that he
                            had detected a great deal of optimism in Latin America over the progress
                            made toward the treaty. This is not a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Panama question alone. The Latin American countries are
                            vitally interested and pleased at the reports of progress. Too negative
                            a statement will affect international opinion and retard this process.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said his
                            statement would not be extremely negative. It will give credit to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration for
                            its efforts to negotiate a treaty. More progress has been made in the
                            last few months than in many years. But public opinion in Panama has
                            suffered from many ups and downs. The only responsible way to make a
                            joint statement is to sign the treaty jointly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said the United
                            States was not anxious for a joint statement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said he would send the
                            Secretary a copy of his statement in advance for him to consider and
                            prepare a similarly balanced statement for the <gloss target="#t_US_2"

                            be cautious but that it was also necessary not to be negative. The
                            general atmosphere is very important to the negotiations. He mentioned
                            the incident of rioting last week.<note n="8" xml:id="d52fn8">Presumably

                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed, but said that the economic situation in
                            Panama is not good. A joint statement would help Panama today because it
                            would encourage economic conditions in the private sector, but later the
                            credibility of the Government of Panama would suffer if the Treaty was
                            not forthcoming. Panama does not want to risk its credibility on a joint
                            statement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said
                            the United States was not interested in a joint statement, it was not
                            pressing for a joint statement. <persName corresp="#p_GN_1"
                                >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> said the Government of Panama was
                            running out of explanations. It has been given the run-around for eight
                            years. The government of General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> promised to carry the flag, to achieve a new
                            Canal Treaty but last week the students were relatively restrained in
                            their demonstrations. That surprised the Government of Panama as well.
                            The problem is, frankly the students don’t believe in the Government
                            anymore. The Government has asked the people to give it one more year;
                            and is working hard to achieve the new Treaty. Secretary <persName

                            Senate approval of a treaty. The whole spectrum of Senate sentiment on
                            the Panama question was represented. In general, treaty supporters had
                            few questions or comments. Discussion focused on problem areas and
                            addressed questions raised by those skeptical or opposed to a treaty.
                            Highlights included Senator <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                                >Jackson</persName>’s commentary on neutrality and Senator <persName

                                >Rogers</persName> was effective in explaining the defense

                            </hi>, noting the history of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                            I agreement, emphasized the importance of having <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> rights under a neutrality agreement set forth in the
                            treaty in language “which a fourth-grader could understand”. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> made clear that he understood
                            the difficulty of making the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> right
                            to take action against Panama too explicit. However, his initial
                            reaction was that the neutrality language “was not good enough”, and he
                            was skeptical about relying on the negotiating record as a basis for
                            unilateral <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> action against Panama.
                            After further discussion, he said he would defer judgement pending a
                            look at the full text of the neutrality agreement, including the
                            specific neutrality rules. He also advised that joint defense
                            arrangements under a new treaty be written to provide the United States
                            with the flexibility needed to act as it deemed necessary.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> firmly
                            supported treaty revision. He noted the dubious origin of the 1903
                                Treaty,<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">The Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty is

                        <p>These are some reflections on the present state of the negotiations for a
                            new Panama Canal treaty and steps which might now be taken to move the
                            negotiations forward.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations recessed on Friday, June 17th, and the Panamanian
                            negotiators returned home in order to consult with their Governmental
                            officials. Prior to the recess the chief of the delegation, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo Escobar Betancourt</persName>,
                            delivered an emotional, critical statement of over an hour expressing
                            Panamanian concerns and levelling certain charges. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> was obviously making the
                            exposition on the direct orders of General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and it is not without significance that during
                            the entire delivery of his statement all four members of the Panamanian
                            delegation kept their heads down and none was willing to look at any of
                            us sitting on the United States side of the table. What made the
                            presentation especially dramatic was that the day before we had
                            concluded our negotiations and lunch on the warmest and most friendly
                            note and the Panamanian negotiators had specifically asked that we be
                            ready to continue negotiations on Friday until all the issues then on
                            the table were disposed of leaving only the matter of financial
                            arrangements for subsequent discussion and agreement.</p>
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>’s diatribe—which he

                            fashion—he made the following charges: That the United States was
                            responsible for launching an international campaign against Panama; that
                            we were acting as though we were doing Panama a favor in the
                            negotiations rather than dealing with them as equals; that a campaign
                            was being conducted to denounce Panama as anti-Semitic because of some
                            charges that had been made and which ignored Panama’s strong support for
                            Israel and its fair treatment of its Jewish citizens; and that the

                            formal discussions, it is quite clear that Panama remains convinced that
                            it should have very large sums in down payment and for the annual use of
                            the canal and the Zone territory. Panama continues to argue that it
                            should be paid for the use of Panamanian territory for fourteen military
                            bases on a scale comparable to what the United States pays to countries
                            such as Spain and others for base rights. Our discussion with the
                            negotiators at lunch on Thursday<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">June
                                16.</note> had been to suggest that the matter of the annual payment
                            under the treaty be disassociated from the economic package which Panama
                            might undertake to negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and the international agencies in order to be able to
                            further its economic development program. The negotiators had told us
                            that they would convey this word to Panama and said that they regarded
                            our exchange at luncheon exceedingly helpful and constructive—an
                            attitude wholly different from the one displayed when we met the
                            following day.</p>
                        <p>Upon reflection it seems to me that several factors may have been
                            involved in the change of tone and atmosphere and these have to be taken
                            into account in determining how to get the negotiations moving again in
                            the right direction.</p>
                        <p>1. Unbeknownst to us here in Washington, at the same time we were
                            speaking candidly and with utter frankness to the Panamanian negotiators
                            on the economic arrangements issue, Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> was apparently striking the same
                            note with the Panamanian Foreign Minister in Grenada.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d54fn5">See <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> To
                            the Panamanians this very likely will <pb n="170" facs="0205"
                                xml:id="pg_170"/>have appeared to be an orchestrated effort on our
                            part to lessen their financial expectations and to try to move them into
                            a more reasonable and practical frame of mind. For both in Grenada and
                            in Washington they were told that the Congress would never approve a
                            treaty which called for very large payments which could not be met out
                            of the tolls from the canal operation—and this position is one which the
                            Panamanians have resisted and continue to resist, arguing that separate
                            payments should indeed be made for military bases and other economic
                            advantages to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> during the treaty
                            period. Conceivably this was the first time the Panamanians recognized
                            that we were both serious and determined on this issue—or conceivably it
                            might be the first time they really understood our position.</p>
                        <p>2. The issue of Panama’s right to appoint Panamanians to serve on the
                            Board of Entity and also as Administrator and Deputy Administrator of
                            the agency running the canal has become increasingly important in recent
                            days, clearly because of political appearances. We have been trying to
                            find formulae which will assure Panama’s agreement to any Panamanians
                            appointed to these posts. At first that seemed to be an acceptable
                            solution but now it is increasingly obvious that Panama wants to be in a
                            position to indicate which Panamanians shall be appointed both to the
                            Board and to the Administrator posts with the knowledge that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> will have to accept Panama’s
                            determination in this regard. Our failure to accede to this has led them
                            to make frequent statements about our attempting to infringe on their
                            sovereign rights in that respect.</p>
                        <p>3. The anti-Semitic issue arose when Panamanian newspapers learned that a
                            Panamanian official who is a cousin of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> had presented a statement which attested to the
                            fact that a Yugoslav contractor doing work on a Panamanian dam had not
                            employed or had any business dealings with Zionists or other Jews. This
                            document was apparently for submission to Libya in order to elicit
                            Libyan interest in Panamanian investment. The Jews in Panama did not
                            express great concern, knowing of Panama’s consistently favorable
                            relationship with Israel and the absence of anti-Semitic policies in the
                            Panamanian Government itself. A Panamanian Jewish citizen named Mizrachi
                            was, indeed, permitted to publish a letter denouncing the whole episode
                            and the Council member involved.<note n="6" xml:id="d54fn6">For

                            Washington and to members of the Congress including Representative
                            Benjamin Rosenthal. On Friday—the day when the negotiators launched
                            their tirade—Jack Anderson had a column which <pb n="171" facs="0206"
                                xml:id="pg_171"/>talked about the Libya-Panama deal and referred to
                            the anti-Semitism hullabaloo quoting from the letter by Congressman
                            Rosenthal to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> expressing concern about these anti-Semitic

                        <p>4. The United States soldier who shot the Panamanian guard apparently
                            made a confession which became the cause for Torrijos’ concern that
                            there was actually a plot under way to assassinate him. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is known to be fearful of
                            such assassination attempts and has in the past reacted strongly when
                            there has been word of any such effort. Since the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> had said that it would try the soldier
                            itself and would not extradite him, this may have fed Torrijos’
                            suspicion that there was indeed some connection between the United
                            States and the demented soldier’s statements.</p>
                        <p>5. Since he agreed to the terms of the Neutrality Treaty which go far
                            beyond anything <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he
                            would accept, it is known that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has been rather severely criticized by some of
                            his own people and by officers of the National Guard who feel he has
                            gone too far. Conceivably Torrijos’ concern has become intensified with
                            the passage of time and he may be wondering whether he has indeed
                            committed himself too far.</p>
                        <p>6. Hovering over all of this is the question which must be plaguing
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> as to whether he
                            can indeed survive—either with a new treaty or without one. He
                            recognizes that he needs a new treaty for the economic future of his
                            country. He is also concerned, however, that a treaty which does not
                            achieve all that he has said it would, will not be supported and may
                            bring about his downfall. He is, therefore, constantly tantalized by the
                            question whether it is better to have the Panama Canal as a cause rather
                            than as an achievement. His wavering on this issue is reflected in his
                            changes of temperament, tone and appraisal of the state of
                                negotiations.<note n="8" xml:id="d54fn8">In a June 21 memorandum to

                                of the May round of negotiations, in which he suggested that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>’s “long
                                nationalistic harangue” on June 17 was a negotiating tactic:
                                “Intelligence reports had previously indicated that Panama might
                                resort to this negotiating ploy—a tactic used during a previous
                                negotiating round. The reports also indicated that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was unhappy with our
                                informal rejection of the Panamanian economic demands and felt the
                                need to slow the negotiations in order to achieve maximum Panamanian
                                gains.” <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> concluded:
                                “It is clear that the recess and the sharp Panamanian harangue
                                presented at the last session are Panamanian negotiating tactics
                                designed to gain additional United States concessions.” (Washington

                        <p>In the light of these facts it would seem that the following course is
                            the best one for us.</p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="0207" xml:id="pg_172"/>
                        <p>1. We should continue our negotiations in a calm and fair spirit,
                            rejecting, of course, any inference or innuendo that the United States
                            is not acting in good faith with other than utter sincerity. Our aim
                            should continue to be to find mutually agreeable solutions to the
                            problems as they come up and to try to have Panama understand that we
                            are sincerely seeking fair answers which will take into account their
                            and our real needs. In that connection, Panama has to be aware of our
                            political concerns and the problems of ratification. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> did indicate during a press
                            conference in Grenada that a real effort would have to be made in the
                            Senate to get requisite support for such a treaty; and that if the
                            treaty were presented for ratification today there might be a question
                            as to its ratification.<note n="9" xml:id="d54fn9">For the text of the

                            This may well have intensified Panamanian concerns but is fully
                            consistent with what they have been told across the negotiating table
                            consistently for weeks and indeed months.</p>
                        <p>2. On the issues (apart from the one of economic arrangements), it should
                            be possible to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution in order to clear
                            the decks for the economic discussions. At the moment, the only problems
                            which still remain unresolved are</p>
                        <p>(a) appointment and removal of Panamanian Entity Board members,</p>
                        <p>(b) appointment and removal of the Panamanian Administrator and Deputy
                            Administrator of the agency operating the canal,</p>
                        <p>(c) rotation policy affecting present employees of the Canal Company,</p>
                        <p>(d) <gloss target="#t_APO_1">APO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PX_1"
                                >PX</gloss> privileges for the United States canal employees.</p>
                        <p>There will obviously have to be some give and take on both sides but
                            these issues are ones which can be resolved if there is a willingness to
                            resolve them.</p>
                        <p>3. The problem of financial arrangements will remain a massive one
                            because Panama’s demands are astronomical and the practical fact is that
                            any treaty which calls for payments to Panama beyond those which can be
                            obtained from the operation of the canal itself will risk and possibly
                            invite rejection by the Senate. This means that there are really two
                            sets of financial arrangements to be agreed upon. In the first place,
                            terms have to be worked out for an annual payment under the treaty to be
                            derived from tolls. In addition, an arrangement will have to be worked
                            out for assuring Panama of the financial help it will require for its
                            economic development programs. The latter will involve the cooperation
                            and guidance of the United States and the international <pb n="173"
                                facs="0208" xml:id="pg_173"/>agencies, and the United States should
                            indicate willingness to work with the Panamanian officials in putting
                            together an acceptable package of appropriate size and content which
                            might meet requisite criteria of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>,
                            the international institutions, and in due course the private
                            sector.</p>
                        <p>4. Because the financial demands and expectations of Panama seem to be so
                            great, and because there seems to be an unwillingness to differentiate
                            between economic arrangements which can be properly made part of the
                            treaty and those which have to be dealt with separately, it may be
                            desirable for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            to telephone General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            after the Panamanian representatives have had the opportunity to state
                            their case<note n="10" xml:id="d54fn10">See <ref target="#d52fn2"

                            </note> in order to assure General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that the United States is eager to be helpful
                            to Panama in connection with its economic requirements. The President
                            could state that there are limitations on what can be properly made part
                            of the treaty as a financial arrangement, but that it should be possible
                            to supplement this through discussions with the United States and the
                            international agencies as well as with the private sector to endeavor to
                            assure that Panama will have the funds it believes it needs in order to
                            carry forward its economic development program.<note n="11"

                            met with President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName> of

                            they both indicated their awareness that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had very large demands in
                            mind in connection with economic arrangements and recognized that the
                            problem was one which would have to be encountered head on. It may be
                            that at a propitious moment we will want to involve President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName>, President Lopez Michelsen, and
                            possibly also President <persName corresp="#p_LJ_1">Lopez
                                Portillo</persName> of Mexico and President Oduber of Costa Rica to
                            try to moderate Torrijos’ excessive expectations and to convey to him an
                            understanding of why the United States position is reasonable.</p>
                        <p>6. Since virtually all the other terms of the treaty will have been
                            agreed upon, it would be appropriate to indicate to Panama at an
                            appropriate time that if a treaty does not eventuate because of
                            disagreement on the financial arrangement issue, the United States would
                            expect to make public the terms of the treaty offered by the United
                            States to Panama to assure both the countries of Latin America and the
                            world generally of the magnanimous spirit in which we have approached
                            the negotiations and the fairness which we have displayed in trying to
                            resolve all these issues. This should not, of course, be put <pb n="174"

                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> on Saturday<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d55fn3">June 25.</note> and last night I spoke with the
                            group of Panamanian negotiators who are presently in Washington, D.C.,
                            and both have said the same thing, that is, that we already have almost
                            reached an agreement regarding what will more or less go into the
                            finished treaty itself. It is a treaty in which the Panamanians feel
                            they have made great concessions to satisfy United States requirements.
                            They understand the reasons why it has to be so, however, though the
                            matters of lands and waters, neutrality, and security are practically
                            agreed, Panama feels it is now confronting considerable difficulty in
                            the area of economic compensation. They base their positions on three
                            arguments:</p>
                        <p>First is the argument that Panama like all other countries is living
                            through an accelerated inflationary process and has to confront the
                            claims for better salaries that are being made by Panamanian workers;
                            that for the Panamanian people the settlement of the Canal will produce
                            no visible or tangible results, that as far as the people are concerned
                            all is going to remain the same. Also for a number of other reasons
                            there will be a deterioration in the economic situation within Panama.
                            They need to demonstrate to their people that a solution of the Panama
                            Canal issue through a treaty will also provide some improvement in their
                            standard of living. They are aware that they are confronting internal
                            criticism regarding the manner in which the Canal issue is being
                            settled. General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has
                            the intention of submitting the treaty to a plebescite, a measure he
                            feels will provide the treaty with greater strength, and he thus fears a
                            situation which could be critical if he cannot as a result improve the
                            economic situation in Panama.</p>
                        <p>His second argument is that a new treaty should be drawn along the lines
                            of other agreements that the United States has signed with other
                            countries and should reflect the same kind of terms and a similarity of
                            conditions. It should pay compensation for concessions in the areas of
                            lands and waters and military bases that are being provided by Panama in
                            the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the treaty is going to impose upon Panama certain new
                            obligations, obligations that carry with them a cost, and also the
                            serious responsibility, after the year 2000 of assuming responsibility
                            for the <pb n="176" facs="0211" xml:id="pg_176"/>management and
                            operation of the canal. This in turn will require that the people of
                            Panama achieve a high level of development. This will serve the common
                            interest of the United States and Panama and such action will not be
                            possible for Panama to undertake without the effective economic
                            cooperation of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I personally believe that you should have something along those lines.
                            The two problems that you face are first how are you going to present
                            this before <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> public opinion and
                            before world opinion. Secondly, how much money is going to be paid and
                            how is this to be done. I have made great efforts to convince General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and his advisors
                            that he must act in such a way that he be most careful to avoid making
                            the new treaty appear as if it were a new sale of the canal, as if the
                            canal were being sold all over again, because this would do considerable
                            damage to the image of both countries. It is also necessary to take care
                            of appearances, to make sure that the impression is not created that
                            simply this or that member of the National Guard is going to be
                            pocketing substantial sums of money. They understand this, that it
                            should be presented in their view as an effort to support cooperation
                            for development through some type of direct or cash contribution for the
                            immediate solution of social problems. However, for them it is
                            impossible to accept an outcome without some kind of settlement of this
                            nature. They tell me that the United States had been negotiating with
                            the Philippines and offered substantial compensation for the presence of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military bases on Philippine
                            territory, and they could not understand why the same could not be true
                            for Panama. This is the picture as they presented it to me.</p>

                            President, as usual you have summarized very simply and clearly the
                            issue and you have accurately reflected the position of the Panamanian
                            representatives, as we understand it. Let me start by stating the fact
                            that we both want the same thing. First, we want Panama to prosper and
                            second we want Panama to feel that it is receiving a fair arrangement
                            with the United States that will be useful to the furtherance of the
                            good relations between our two countries. However, the primary issue at
                            this point is the matter of timing, and of the inter-relationship
                            between the treaty and some kind of internal development program for
                                Panama.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">An unknown hand highlighted the
                                last two sentences.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>What we are saying quite simply is, let us take one thing at a time. Let
                            us conclude a treaty, one in which we are offering very generous
                            economic compensation which is directly related to the canal itself, and
                            then when the treaty is signed be assured that the United States
                            Government will work in any way it can, to assist in the development <pb
                                n="177" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_177"/>of an economic program that
                            would involve not only the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government
                            but also international lending agencies, that will contribute to the
                            achievement of the goals that you have set for your country. However, if
                            we tie one to the other you are basically assuring the defeat of the
                            treaty in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Senate. Because, as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated when we
                            visited Caracas, the most prevalent question posed to us when we are up
                            on the Hill is “Do you mean to say we are giving them all of this which
                            we value at more than $6 billion and we still have to pay millions or
                            billions of dollars to have them take the Canal over?”</p>
                        <p>To further complicate the achievement of a satisfactory treaty, something
                            which is difficult at best, would be the effect of trying to tie an
                            economic development program to the outcome of such a treaty. It would
                            suggest to the Congress that it is part of the price that we have to pay
                            for the treaty and would consequently strengthen the hand of those who
                            oppose the treaty in Congress.</p>
                        <p>What I have said to our friends on the Panamanian side is simple: let us
                            give you assurances of our desire to help you; of our desire to be
                            friendly and to cooperate in all possible forms; but let us not make it
                            part of the treaty negotiations.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">An unknown

                            ones that it makes it impossible for us to consider them. I assume that
                            this is an opening gambit in the negotiations yet their figures are much

                            involved. First they understand the difficulties that the United States
                            Government has in Congress, however, for them to present an agreement to
                            Panamanian public opinion and to Latin American public opinion, they
                            need to link both aspects, even if they were to be dealt with in
                            separate documents or be treated separately. They see no way in which
                            they can submit one without the other, and they consider this a
                            condition which they cannot renounce. That reason makes them very
                            demanding. As far as the amount of monies to be received, it is a
                            question that can be negotiated. However, it is probably the time for
                            the United States to make a counter-proposal for their
                                consideration.<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6">An unknown hand

                            understand the matter of the figures they have brought up in the
                            negotiations because they elevate the negotiations to the high
                            atmosphere and we certainly cannot engage in astronomical gyrations. We
                            understand that this might only be a tactic. However, I do not believe
                            it is wise for them to use this approach because, for instance,
                            yesterday, in connection with this very same problem, they met with very
                            high-level representatives of the Department of the Treasury, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> State Department and representatives
                            of the international banks.<note n="7" xml:id="d55fn7">No record of

                            by the figures suggested by Panama.</p>
                        <p>However, taking into account their concerns—and we can appreciate the
                            reasons for some of their concerns—it would be possible to find a simple
                            way of broaching the subject. First, we could sign a treaty. Secondly,
                            we would have a period between the signature and the ratification of
                            this treaty. Third, during this period we would be happy to work on a
                            program for the economic development of Panama, however, one cannot be
                            part of the other. For their purposes they can say that they have
                            achieved this economic development program and present it to their
                            people as if one were part of the other, but we, in the United States,
                            cannot say that one is a part of the other.<note n="8" xml:id="d55fn8"

                            Under such circumstances, the United States could assume to study what

                            <hi rend="italic">PEREZ:</hi> There are certain objections that I feel
                            you should know of and I, as an outside participant, as an observer,
                            would have to say certain things that the United States would not be
                            willing to accept. First, that the sovereignty over the Canal was
                            illegitimately taken away from Panama by the United States. This is not
                            my personal opinion, yet that is the way in which many people see it.
                            That is how the situation is perceived and it is one of the reasons that
                            could give rise to attacks on the manner in which General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is conducting or directing
                            the negotiations and could be the basis for attacks on the treaty you
                            reach on the part of extremists who seek out any argument that will
                            provide them a basis for criticism of the treaty and of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> Government. This kind of
                            solution is not one that would be received with applause by all
                            concerned. Some would accuse Panama because they will not recover all of
                            the lands and waters, and because military bases will still remain. They
                            would argue that the only achievement would be that there has been a
                            shrinking in the military occupation but that basically nothing had
                            changed. This would be a way to attack the treaty as it is now
                            conceived. This is a matter of the greatest concern for Panama. They
                            feel that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government pays for
                            the use of bases in other areas and they see no reason why they couldn’t
                            do so in Panama also. Therefore, the solution they seek appears to be
                            the only defense that would offset the charges that could be leveled <pb
                                n="180" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_180"/>against them. I am making these
                            observations because I see the Panamanian position hardening
                            considerably now.</p>
                        <p>About ten or twelve days ago the Panamanian negotiating team came to
                            Venezuela to visit me and I gave them a number of reasons why they
                            should not speak in terms of millions of dollars but rather should
                            discuss only numbers of projects to be implemented. However, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was both concerned
                            and angry that I told him this because he expected support from me in
                            his aspirations. That was the reason General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> came to Caracas on
                                Saturday.<note n="13" xml:id="d55fn13">In telegram 6476 from

                                59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770230–0910)</note> I was able to
                            give him a number of arguments to demonstrate to him that he should be
                            very careful regarding any outcome that would mention the fact that
                            large amounts of cash were being received. In spite of this, last night
                            Romulo insisted that they were going to maintain the same position. So I
                            do not see easy progress in the negotiations now. You are at a very
                            difficult impasse, and General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> does not understand well that the negotiations
                            might be—at present—at a critical juncture.</p>
                        <p>He told me that he was not interested in having a treaty ratified by the
                            Senate now, that it could be ratified some years later. I told him that
                            it is not so in countries such as ours, that we cannot simply sign a
                            treaty and lock it in a desk drawer and maintain it secret. It has to be
                            exposed to public scrutiny and submitted to Congress for ratification.
                            It is evident that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> now is at a
                            most difficult time in the negotiating process and that it has to agree
                            on a treaty that will be least subject to attack in the Senate. Maybe
                            one problem is that we are starting with the wrong premise, the premise
                            that the Panama Canal belongs to the United States. So the problem is
                            further complicated and I think that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> will not accept an agreement
                            without a precise and certain assurance regarding compensation.</p>
                        <p>Maybe we could search for some way, as I stated earlier, in the form of a
                            general declaration that would express confidence in decisions,
                            decisions to be taken in other places, regarding the development
                            program. It would be necessary to avoid an impasse such as the one that
                            resulted at the time of the negotiations on lands and waters and
                            security and neutrality, all of which have now been overcome. Maybe it
                            is necessary now for the United States Government to present a
                            counter-proposal.</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_181"/>
                        <p>There is another important aspect, that of the annuity. According to the
                            Panamanians, the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators hold
                            the thesis that any annuity could only come from the benefits resulting
                            from the tolls collected. Therefore, if Panama wants a higher amount, it
                            would be necessary to increase the tolls for transit through the Canal.
                            This, in their view, would set world public opinion against Panama. If
                            you were dealing with a single enterprise, responsible only for the
                            transit of ships through the Canal, it would be appropriate to think
                            that Panama should receive only income derived from the operation of the
                            Canal. The issue however is much more complex, because in addition to a
                            canal you have military bases, as well as other areas of Panamanian
                            territory devoted to other activities which are affected by the use of
                            the canal. And that has a price. Therefore they need to see the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> change its position regarding the
                            payment of an annuity and not link it to the tolls.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">LINOWITZ</persName>:</hi> Mr.
                            President, you have just touched upon the key issues in our negotiation.
                            First, regarding the annual payment under the new treaty for the use of
                            the Panama Canal, we have been directed by the President—and have
                            assured the Congress—that, considering all the commitments and other
                            conveyances to be made to Panama (with a value of approximately $6
                            billion), we cannot go to the Congress for an annual appropriation as
                            part of the treaty. Therefore, any payment resulting from the terms of
                            the new treaty must come from the tolls. Though we have not formally
                            presented it yet at the negotiating table, we have ready to present a
                            study which indicates, that with a 25% increase in the tolls, the
                            traffic through the Canal would remain high, and there would be no
                            adverse effects.<note n="14" xml:id="d55fn14">Not found.</note> As a
                            result, a sufficient amount would be received to provide $1 billion
                            during the life of the treaty. That is to say, that they will receive
                            substantial amounts under the formula we are considering. This could be
                            one formula that could be approached. Secondly, we would be turning over
                            assets worth approximately $6 billion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">BUNKER</persName>:</hi> Many of these
                            assets in fact would be earning assets which would make an additional
                            contribution to the economic benefits that Panama would derive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">LINOWITZ</persName>:</hi> Millions of
                            dollars will come into Panama as a result of some of those assets to be
                            turned over. For example, $115 million are to be received for services
                            rendered to the Canal operations, such as bunkering, etc. These we would
                            turn over immediately at the time of the signature of the treaty. In
                            addition as a result of the return of a number of commercial operations,
                            they would also be benefitting from new sources that would bring a
                            number of millions of dollars a year. <pb n="182" facs="0217"
                                xml:id="pg_182"/>So financially, they would be doing very well as a
                            result of our present offer. Our problem is to explain to the Congress
                            why we would have to give something in addition. This would represent an
                            added obligation, of a multi-million dollar level to an economic
                            development program, which complicates the negotiations to the point
                            that we cannot count on a serious consideration of the matter as they
                            are now presenting it.</p>
                        <p>In your presentation, Mr. President, you may have the formula that we
                            could perhaps follow. Panama could agree to the conclusion of a treaty,
                            and agree on most of the other issues that are now related to
                            compensation within the terms of the treaty. Perhaps then at the time
                            the treaty is signed, and while discussions are taking place outside of
                            the negotiating process, you could tell General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government will do all that it could
                            possibly do to help with an economic development program. You could also
                            assure General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> that the
                            United States desires to help in any way that is possible. Thereafter,
                            through ensuing negotiations and discussions on the form of the economic
                            aid—once these are brought to solution before ratification—Panama would
                            find itself in a position that would permit General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> to state that he has a
                            satisfactory treaty and that he has a satisfactory program for economic
                            development. However, I feel we should neither stop the negotiations now
                            nor tie one thing with another.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">PEREZ:</hi> The internal difficulties faced within the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government are obvious, and I
                            understand them. Yet I also see that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> cannot risk to announce the
                            satisfactory conclusion of a treaty if he does not have a clear
                            indication on other pending matters. This reflects a very difficult
                            situation. Because if at the same time he cannot announce that the
                            economic aspect is resolved, his personal political situation would be
                            endangered in his own country. We have to bear in mind the inter-play of
                            personal ambitions within Panama. We cannot tell what the outcome of
                            these might be. There are always hidden forces that are interested in a
                            confrontation and could create difficulties in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>I see that we are coming to a moment of great danger. The expectations
                            are many. For all practical purposes you have already reached an
                            agreement that would favor a positive conclusion. Yet I am very
                            confused, because I see that we have reached a point where the two sides
                            have become firm and entrenched in antagonistic positions.</p>
                        <p>You will recall, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName>, that when you were in Caracas you mentioned
                            that you feared because you did not know what Panama would be asking in
                            terms of economic compensation. At that time you already foresaw
                            difficulties in this area. As I told you at that time I am fully
                            disposed to contribute to softening the position of Panama, yet I must
                            also tell him, General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>,
                            that I am equally willing to assist in softening the United States
                            position.</p>

                            should be further explored. If General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> were to be told in a letter from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, that at the time of
                            the signature of the treaty, of strong indications of the commitment on
                            the part of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government to take
                            affirmative, constructive and positive steps to help Panama to work out
                            its economic development plans, this might give him the sense of trust
                            that we need at this time.<note n="15" xml:id="d55fn15">See <ref
                                    target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> We would try to work out
                            something, although we do not know the specifics. However, as we
                            negotiate and discuss we would try to arrive at these specifics.</p>
                        <p>The other alternative would be to hold up the treaty until all problems
                            have been resolved. However, we might lose the appropriate or the best
                            time to achieve progress. This would be a risk that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would run, as well as a risk
                            that we would be running.</p>

                            that we have exchanged. There is another point that I would like to
                            bring up that has been a source of unhappiness amongst our friends.
                            Apparently, some installations are being dismantled and these are part
                            of what would be turned over to Panama. The Panamanian negotiators
                            showed us some photos of the buildings that were being dismantled. They
                            do not believe that this is due to instructions from higher levels or
                            from high-level decisions in the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government. Yet decisions are being made at lower levels, and because of
                            the hostility that has existed among certain groups against Panama in
                            the area, these developments are unsettling.</p>

                            those photographs. They are of old wooden buildings of over 70 years and
                            the cost of their maintenance is prohibitive. Some of those buildings
                            are coming down because they cannot be maintained. This is done normally
                            on a regular basis and it is not related in any way to this present
                            stage of our negotiations.</p>

                            allegations. What happened is what he has explained and we will be happy
                            to show the Panamanian negotiators the reasons why these buildings are
                            being torn down. These actions are in no way related to the
                            negotiations. However, this event underlines a problem that we are
                            facing at present: the long-held suspicion and distrust that we have
                            been working so hard to overcome during the course of our talks. We have
                            great respect for the Panamanian negotiators. We feel they are men of
                            integrity and they are trustworthy. I hope that they will believe us,
                            yet we fear that this distrust still exists. As a result, a small
                            incident such as the one referred to with the photos, as well as two
                            other incidents in recent <pb n="184" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_184"

                            States make progress more difficult. We are trying to be patient in
                            explaining that we are not trying to get around the provisions of the
                            treaty or harm in any other way the interests of Panama. The <gloss

                            <hi rend="italic">PEREZ:</hi> I have a question. How did the <gloss

                            equipment—no specific amounts of dollars. These loans and equipment can
                            be translated into money equivalents, yet the transfer is not of funds
                            but of facilities and loans.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">LINOWITZ</persName>:</hi> This is the
                            same thing that we would be doing with Panama. We would be making
                            resources available in a sense in exchange for use of facilities and of
                            the bases. I am not at all afraid of making comparisons in this context.
                            I would like to add one word; that is, that I am not afraid of such
                            comparisons. We are proud of what we have offered Panama. We would be
                            proud to let the world see and to let our country see the terms of our
                            treaty, because we feel that we have been most generous, most
                            magnanimous, and we have made genuine efforts to arrive at a treaty of
                            which we can be proud. There is nothing therein of which we are ashamed.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> ought to know
                            that we would be pleased to let the world see what the United States is
                            willing to do. I think it is very important.</p>
                        <p>We are not unaware of the fact that there are some unhappy chapters in
                            the history of the relations between the United States and Panama, yet
                            we now are at what we could consider the proudest chapter of these
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">PEREZ:</hi> I also feel that great progress has been
                            accomplished within the concept that prevails in the United States
                            regarding the Panama Canal—a concept which we do not necessarily share.
                            At the same time we see two parallel views struggling for approval
                            before world opinion. On the one hand there is the view that the United
                            States is handing over assets valued at over $6 billion as well as
                            turning over rights that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> has
                            exercised for many years. On the other hand, there are the views of
                            those who feel that the Canal represents a usurpation by the United
                            States which obtained advantages at a very small cost, from a very large
                            territory it has occupied for many years. Now they should not only
                            return what they took but should also compensate Panama.</p>
                        <p>This same kind of thesis was sustained by some in Venezuela at the time
                            of the negotiations on the nationalization of oil. Some sectors argued
                            that it was inconceivable to pay compensation to multi-national
                            corporations that for over 50 years had been exploiting our oil
                            resources, oil obtained at very low prices, enabling them to realize
                            very large profits. These profits represented two to three times the
                            investment <pb n="185" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_185"/>they had made in
                            Venezuela. Therefore, Venezuela should not only receive the oil
                            installations but also additional compensation. On the other hand the
                            argument was made that this did not represent a rational approach and we
                            were aware of the fact that to reach an agreement we should pay some
                            compensation and we did so. I offer this comparison because it parallels
                            the arguments made by Panama regarding why they should get additional
                            compensation in connection with the conclusion of a new treaty. When I
                            mentioned this to the Panamanian negotiators, they pointed out that
                            there was an essential difference. Venezuela took over productive
                            profitable operations which in turn could benefit the people of
                            Venezuela. In contrast, Panama would be acquiring something of
                            theoretical value but it would be very difficult to provide immediate
                            benefits for the people of Panama and therefore it would be very
                            difficult to explain the value of the treaty to the Panamanians.</p>
                        <p>I don’t doubt that there is some solid basis for progress, and I feel
                            that this is the time when an imaginative effort must be made to work
                            out some kind of an acceptable formula.</p>
                        <p>What would be your concept of something that could be provided, some
                            level of funding, not at the levels that Panama is suggesting, yet at
                            some reasonable level which would allow the Government of Panama to do
                            something tangible for their people as a result of the signature of a
                            treaty?</p>
                        <p>I am aware of the fact that the Senate would raise an uproar if
                            confronted with unreasonable demands.</p>

                            time is short now. I would like to suggest once again one possibility
                            for discussion. Under the terms of the treaty, a certain amount of funds
                            could be made available in the order of $30–40 million. That amount
                            could be used when the treaty is signed as leverage to obtain a larger
                            loan, something in the order of half a billion dollars. This could be
                            achieved by taking future income from Canal tolls and using it to
                            liquidate the loans. But we cannot have this type of a formula until we
                            have a treaty. We must know where we can start, as well as how we can
                            undertake this cooperation without endangering the successful outcome of
                            the new treaty.</p>

                        <p>The discussion was positive and constructive and focused as much on the
                            domestic political context as on the substance of a treaty.<note n="3"

                            spoke very frankly about the political difficulties attendant on
                            securing approval of a treaty, they appreciated the need to address the
                            Canal problem and suggested a number of steps that might be taken to
                            smooth the way for a favorable vote in the Senate. With regard to the
                            treaty itself, security and defense<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4">An

                            be the first area of concern. There was also discussion of compensation
                            and of possible future Panamanian and Latin American demands for further
                            treaty revision.<note n="5" xml:id="d56fn5">An unknown hand underlined

                        </p>
                        <p>Timing was a matter of acute concern, particularly to those Senators like
                                <hi rend="italic">Johnston</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Domenici</hi>,
                            who will be running in 1978. As <hi rend="italic">Johnston</hi> put it:
                            “I am convinced that it is important to get this treaty to the Senate
                            just as soon as possible—after November 1978.” <hi rend="italic"
                                >Johnston</hi> thought <pb n="187" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_187"
                            />there was no possibility the Senate would have time to consider a
                            treaty in 1977, and Senators <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Chiles</persName> and <persName

                            </hi> warned that the treaty did not have the votes at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Several Senators urged that authoritative information (especially from

                            new treaty be made available to help convince the public of the
                            desirability of a new treaty. They asked that this cover:</p>
                        <p>—the strategic value of the Canal (<hi rend="italic">Senator

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Senator <persName corresp="#p_MRB_1">Morgan</persName>
                            </hi> stressed the need to counter anti-treaty propaganda alleging that
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was a communist and
                            that there was heavy Cuban and Communist influence in Panama. He also
                            suggested that in justifying increased compensation to Panama, we cite
                            the precedent of our Philippine base treaties, which have several times
                            been revised to provide for increased payments to the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The need to enlist public support for the treaty from individuals and
                            organizations that could influence conservative opinion was also
                            emphasized. Suggested targets included:</p>
                        <p>—Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>, who might be
                            invited by the President to make a trip to Panama. This would provide an
                            occasion for <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> to
                            publicize his support of treaty revision (Suggested by <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>—The incoming American Legion national commander, a Louisiana resident
                            whom <hi rend="italic">Senator Johnston</hi> believes might be persuaded
                            to support a treaty.</p>
                        <p>—The American Security Council (suggested by <hi rend="italic">Sen.

                        <p>Questions on the security aspects of a treaty dealt with our right under

                            </hi>), and the military value of the Canal (Senator <hi rend="italic"
                                >Johnston</hi>). <hi rend="italic">General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>
                            </hi> explained the security risks involved in maintaining the status
                            quo and the willingness of the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> to
                            support new arrangements that included an adequate neutrality agreement.
                            He said that the Canal would be of little use in a nuclear war but would
                            be valuable—though not vital—in a non-nuclear situation to facilitate
                            rapid deployment of our full military sealift capacity, which was
                            normally divided between the Pacific and the Atlantic. As to neutrality
                            in wartime, he explained that all ships, including those of countries at
                                <pb n="188" facs="0223" xml:id="pg_188"/>war with the United States,
                            would have the right of passage, but that the United States would rely,
                            as in World War II, on its capacity to intercept enemy ships before they
                            reached the Canal. <hi rend="italic">Senator <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HHJ_2">Heinz</persName>
                            </hi> cautioned against overestimating the capacity of overland
                            alternatives (especially railroads). <hi rend="italic">Senator <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>
                            </hi> emphasized that discussion of the possible costs of Canal closure
                            should not obscure the key point about security—that a new treaty would
                            greatly improve the chances that the Canal would continue to be open and
                            available.</p>

                            </hi> said these were out of the ball park and that the <gloss

                            amounting to $30–50 million. In response to Ambassador <persName

                            </hi> and <hi rend="italic">Johnston</hi> said that from a domestic
                            political standpoint security would override compensation as an issue in
                            considering a new treaty, although <hi rend="italic">Johnston</hi>
                            thought that there might be some public resistance even to raising
                            payments to Panama from the present $2 million to $30–50 million.
                            Senator <hi rend="italic">

                            </hi> suggested fixing compensation as a percentage of net canal revenue
                            in order to provide an incentive for the canal to operate at a profit.

                        <p>1. We appreciate the opportunity to review State’s June 25 drafts of a
                            Canal Treaty and implementing agreement, since the rapidity of changes
                            and new agreements in the accelerated negotiations in recent weeks have
                            made it impossible for us to stay fully abreast of developments.<note

                                requesting prompt consideration of a draft treaty package. State
                                requested urgent action on the draft treaty in the hopes of
                                commencing treaty drafting with the Panamanians during the week of
                                July 4. (Washington National Records Center, ISA Files, FRC:
                                330–79–0089, Panama, January–15 Aug 1977)</note> Our review will be
                            somewhat restricted by the short deadline and instructions to the effect
                            that the drafts embody principles and language already agreed to by
                            Panama and that we should therefore try to minimize suggestions for
                            change.</p>
                        <p>2. Since the matter apparently is being rapidly brought to a conclusion,
                            I have at your invitation sent representatives to Washington to
                            participate in the meetings now going on. This message will be
                            restricted to observations and suggestions concerning selected major
                            issues, by way of stating our position or pointing up some areas we
                            think involve inconsistencies or ambiguity.</p>
                        <p>3. The drafts are said to be based upon a draft treaty the Panama Canal
                            prepared in 1975, but, although there are similarities in form and
                            substance, it is apparent that in a number of areas important to Canal
                            operation the negotiators have not been able to sustain this agency’s
                            positions. The matters that do not reflect our views, most of which have
                            been stated many times and are covered by the Panama Canal drafts,
                            include by way of example:</p>
                        <p>A. Ownership of installations and property. Vesting immediate ownership
                            in Panama of all <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> real property
                            including improvements thereon (Canal locks, dams, all buildings and
                            installations, etc.) is not sound in my opinion. The reason for
                            proposing this transfer of right, title and interest is not clear to us.
                            Presumably it is intended that Panama at the same time grants back to
                            the United States full right to use the property as though it were the
                            owner. The problems involved <pb n="190" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_190"
                            />include: (1) it is important to fiscal management that the property be
                            subject to the usual depreciation; (2) management should be free to
                            modify, replace or otherwise dispose of or act with respect to
                            improvements to real property as an owner would in the operation of the
                            enterprise; (3) potential conflict with Panama over interpretation of
                            use rights of facilities in the light of their ownership by Panama. If
                            the concept of Article VIII<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Article VIII of
                                the final Panama Canal Treaty was entitled “Privileges and
                                Immunities.”</note> is pursued, it should be made absolutely clear
                            that the Panama grant of use under Article III<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d57fn4">Article III of the final Panama Canal Treaty was
                                entitled “Canal Operation and Management.”</note> is free of charge
                            and includes the right to modify, replace, or otherwise dispose of
                            improvements, and that any inconsistencies in other provisions be
                            resolved so that there is no doubt as to the rights that accrue to the
                            United States even though Panama is the owner of, say, a building or
                            other improvement to real property.</p>
                        <p>B. Control of Balboa port facilities, including Drydock No. 1, <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> housing, and licensing of land in
                            Canal operating areas. The drafts do not give the Canal administration
                            the control we have recommended and still recommend.</p>
                        <p>C. Status of forces agreement application. The drafts treat Canal <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> employees differently than military
                            civilian <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> employees in some
                            important respects, contrary to our recommendations and to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> negotiating position in the past. Most
                            importantly, the use of military exchanges, commissaries and post
                            offices should not be limited to five years.</p>
                        <p>4. I have serious concern about the coordinating committee established by
                            Article III of the draft implementing agreement, and its functions which
                            are many and varied under the provisions of the agreement. There should
                            not be, in my opinion, in addition to the board of directors and the
                            consultative committee, a further joint committee with independent
                            authority which could superimpose its management of certain matters on
                            the Canal administration, diluting its authority and affecting its
                            responsibilities. I do not question the need for coordination between
                            the Canal administration and Panama in the many matters referred to in
                            the drafts.</p>
                        <p>We have in the past concurred in a joint advisory committee, with
                            technical subcommittees, to coordinate various matters with Panama, with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> representative being either the
                            Canal administrator or his designee. I think the relationship between
                            the coordinating committee and the administrator needs to be clearly
                            established and, specifically, I recommend that the committee be
                            composed of a <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen <pb n="191"
                                facs="0226" xml:id="pg_191"/>who is either the Canal administrator
                            or his designee, and a representative of Panama.</p>
                        <p>5. There are a number of other questions or comments concerning the
                            drafts which my representatives now working with you in Washington will
                            bring to your attention and which are therefore not included in this
                            message.</p>
                        <p>6. On many occasions, particularly in the past two months, my staff has
                            been called upon to choose between what we have viewed as unsatisfactory
                            alternatives bearing on the future operation and maintenance of the
                            Canal and retention of the necessary skilled workforce. I realize that
                            the negotiators are balancing broad national policy considerations
                            against our operational considerations which have often been outweighed.
                            It should be understood, however, that our attempts to select the best
                            from among alternatives which do not reflect our position, and our
                            efforts now in working to make the best of whatever is decided, are not
                            to be construed as an endorsement of the negotiators’ positions that are
                            contrary to ours.</p>
                        <p>7. In order to achieve a treaty, the negotiators have made concessions
                            which cause me real concern as to whether the United States will have or
                            be able to retain the controls it needs to maintain and operate the
                            Canal for the duration of the treaty with a reasonable degree of
                            efficiency and on a sound financial basis. Apart from the basic question
                            of jurisdiction, resolved in favor of Panama long ago, the concessions
                            causing this concern include the dilution of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> control over the Canal operating area; relinquishment
                            of Balboa port facilities, including Drydock No. 1, that are essential
                            to Canal support; relinquishment of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            citizen housing with only limited use rights retained; the switch in
                            1990 to a Panamanian administrator; and inadequate treatment of employee
                            rights and benefits.</p>
                        <p>8. On the latter point, I feel obligated to emphasize once again that the
                            adequate protection of employees is very important not only to the
                            employees, both <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens and
                            others, but to Canal management as well. If our employees perceive the
                            proposed treaty as deficient in this respect, I anticipate labor
                            problems which could disrupt or shut down the Canal operations, with
                            results that could complicate and jeopardize the ratification process.
                            Our detailed, written views on employee rights, benefits and assurances
                            have been fully presented during the past year.</p>

                            Venezuela. It was a very profitable conversation, not only because
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName> has been a

                            the Panama Canal issue. He also indicated the great difficulties that
                            you and the President have to face here in the United States. He stated
                            that, in his personal opinion, the President and both of you were
                            honestly attempting to arrive at an agreement with Panama. He felt that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was being kept
                            well informed by you regarding the status of the negotiations. We also
                            told him that we felt President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> and you were earnestly seeking a treaty with
                            Panama. We told President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName>
                            that we were going to have this private luncheon with both of you and he
                            is aware of the fact that we would be bringing up matters, which at this
                            time, it is not advisable to bring up at the negotiating table. He
                            advised us that in discussing in all honesty and candor the economic
                            issues, that we should not lock ourselves into positions. I feel that
                            what has brought us here together today, is our desire to seek a
                            solution to what has been labelled economic aspects, but which we really
                            believe are political decisions that the four of us must reach.</p>
                        <p>We have seen in recent days indications of an attempt on the part of the
                            United States delegation to seek a satisfactory solution. The very fact
                            that they have tried to present a new formula, is in effect important to
                            us. We are not here to go over the history of our negotiations regarding
                            that aspect which refers to what Panama expects in terms of economic
                                compensation.<note n="6" xml:id="d58fn6">See <ref target="#d52fn2"

                            </note> We have done so repeatedly at the negotiating table. For
                            instance, we are aware of the formula suggested under which as a result
                            of a twenty-five cent increase in the toll additional revenues would
                            make possible annual payments to Panama in the order of $45 million. We
                            have already indicated that we find that that is too little, and that we
                            expect a formula will be developed in the near future to make that
                            amount larger.<note n="7" xml:id="d58fn7">

                                considered the annual payments too small. It was agreed that the

                            <hi rend="italic">ROYO:</hi> There is an important point that I want to
                            make. It is that we have not come here today to discuss figures with
                            you. I would like to precede my comments with the following remarks. Dr.
                            Escobar and I are not negotiating here in the United States, because we
                            are the best lawyers in the country or because we are the best patriots
                            in Panama. We are negotiating here because General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> selected us as part of a
                            group to come to negotiate with you. But more specifically, Dr. Escobar
                            and I have been selected because we will be the ones responsible for
                            defending the treaty in Panama. The defense of the treaty in the United
                            States will involve explaining it to Congress, presenting it to the
                            press, and convincing a certain sector of American public opinion. For
                            us the defense of the treaty involves something further. It means that
                            we will have to meet in public plazas or squares, in the meeting halls
                            of universities, in union halls and address workers and speak to
                            students, as well as appear on TV panels and answer questions from our
                            enemies. These enemies will try to portray themselves as greater
                            patriots than we. Now, why have Dr. Escobar and I been selected? Because
                            both of us were student leaders. Dr. Escobar for more years than I but
                            in addition we were selected because none of us has been a Congressman
                            nor a cabinet minister nor a high-level official in any previous
                            Panamanian government. This means that we start with a clean slate. As a
                            result, and I hope you excuse the false modesty implied, because of our
                            credibility as leaders. It is this credibility that will make us more
                            effective when we confront workers, farmers, and students, and take up
                            the defense of the treaty that we will sign with you. Dr. Escobar has
                            been rector of the University of Panama for five years. In that
                            university he had all kinds of elements, Maoists, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName>-communists, capitalists, and all
                            other representatives of the political spectrum. On the other hand, I
                            have been Minister of Education for three and one-half years and I am
                            sure you are well aware of what it means in Latin American to be a
                            rector of a university or a Minister of Education. It is indeed a very
                            different proposition from what those positions entail in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Escobar and I have firmly decided that upon our return to Panama when
                            the treaty is agreed, we will assume the responsibility <pb n="195"
                                facs="0230" xml:id="pg_195"/>of selling the treaty, of disseminating
                            information on its value and we shall do so by telling the whole truth.
                            We will be reporting on the good things in the treaty and I feel sure
                            that in five minutes you could prepare a list of those things, as well
                            as the bad things, something on which we could also prepare a list in
                            less than five minutes. We naturally assume that you will also be
                            talking about the good things in the treaty and we are well aware that
                            Congressmen will be pointing out the bad things in the treaty. Within
                            that framework of explaining the treaty by telling the whole truth about
                            it, we feel we will be facing great difficulties. The question that
                            arises is whether we will be able to defend before our people a treaty,
                            simply by explaining what the achievements are in contrast with those
                            other matters that are not that favorable, and that in fact hurt the
                            people of our country. Machiavelli in his book “The Prince” stated that
                            the people are quick to forget their gratitudes for the positive things
                            that their governors have provided, yet they always maintain their
                            claims to the unfulfilled promises, and it is the latter that they
                            always remember. In other words our people would not be looking so much
                            upon what we got for them under the treaty as to those things which we
                            did not get for them. It is our wish to strike a balance between the
                            good and the bad in the treaty and maybe this can be accomplished by
                            achieving the “ugly” that is to say through money. This is because our
                            people are still affected by malnutrition and there are considerable
                            social needs that the government yet has to meet, and funds are
                            necessary to find solutions to those pressing problems.</p>
                        <p>It is very difficult for us, and we plead with you that you believe our
                            sincerity, to present the argument which says: In the area of Panama’s
                            economic aspirations, we have obtained an increase in the tolls that
                            ships will have to pay for transitting the Canal; we have also obtained
                            a greater margin regarding long-term financing of loans for development
                            projects. These loans are debts that have to be paid back. We have also
                            heard about possible cooperation between the two countries as outlined
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CRN_1">Cooper</persName>, but all these refer to
                            possibilities to obtain more financing. These deal only with certain
                            economic aspects, but not with those that Dr. Escobar and I feel
                            constitute actually a political issue that requires a political
                            solution. We have to bear in mind the argument that with the military
                            bases staying in Panama, this could justify economic compensation to our
                            country for the use of such bases. Therefore, we would like to find out
                            whether it would be possible to find some kind of a formula of a mixed
                            or ambivalent nature which could serve the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government in the sense that it could avoid stating
                            that it was giving economic compensation, a matter <pb n="196"
                                facs="0231" xml:id="pg_196"/>which we understand is very difficult,
                            and at the same time would serve us, and allow us to say that for the
                            use of the airspace the military installation, and some other
                            privileges, over the next 23 years, our country could obtain some
                            benefit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">ESCOBAR:</hi> That is the general framework of the
                            ideas we wanted to present to you. We know that the matter of an annuity
                            is one which can be satisfactorily arranged by the economists of both
                            countries. We also know that the United States, in fact, would help
                            considerably in the economic development of Panama. It would do so with
                            pleasure because it is a country which believes in development. The
                            political problem for us is to find through some formula, through some
                            avenue the solution which will make possible the approval of the treaty
                            by the Panamanian people. We must receive some cash amount before, or at
                            the time of, entry into force of the treaty. Let me explain why. At the
                            time the treaty goes into force, we will not be otherwise in a position
                            to produce an immediate reduction in unemployment. We will not be able
                            to solve some of the basic needs of our country. This our people will
                            not understand and they will reject the treaty. On the other hand, with
                            the adoption of our own emergency plans, we could create favorable
                            conditions and favorable attitudes regarding both positive and negative
                            aspects of the treaty. We have an immediate need to satisfy economic
                            problems in our country. We are not trying to say what sum this should
                            be. That could be worked out as we progress in the negotiation of the
                            treaty. The money is not important to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> nor is it important to us. It
                            is important from the political point of view in the context of having
                            the treaty approved.</p>
                        <p>We confront a difficult problem of attitude in our country. We might
                            present to the people of our country all the documents we want signed by
                            the highest authorities in the United States, yet our people will feel
                            frustrated because they believe that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> will not live up to those commitments. That is the
                            interpretation people give to your actions in our country. People do not
                            believe in what we are doing and they say that anything we sign with the
                            United States is going to be worthless because they do not trust the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> I am sorry to say so, but I
                            have to be frank and that is the atmosphere that exists in our country.
                            Therefore, there must be some way for our people to really see that the
                            United States is serious in its negotiation with the United States and
                            the only way to demonstrate it to them is with money. Money that we can
                            use to provide employment, health, and schools. These should be funds
                            that are not subject to programs, but to use at our own initiative. When
                            the people of our country hear about a program of loans, they feel much
                            resentment. They do not understand such a <pb n="197" facs="0232"
                                xml:id="pg_197"/>program and they do not like it. We know better,
                            and we realize that these programs can be useful. Yet our people don’t
                            understand these programs and they want to see something more concrete.
                            This is what we need to present a treaty that will be approved. We must
                            make efforts now to find the way to return the faith of our people so
                            that they believe in the possibility of better relationships with the
                            United States. In order to do so, we cannot proceed from theory to
                            reality or from hope to material realizations, but on the contrary, we
                            have to start from reality and we have to start from material
                            accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>I must also say that General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> is the only person who has managed to hold
                            things under control in Panama. In our country we have many individuals
                            who have been trained in Cuba, in North Korea, in China and in the
                            Soviet Union. However, we have managed to contain them for many years.
                            We feel that when those individuals who are now restrained are released,
                            the outcome might be more costly to the United States than would be the
                            economic or cash compensation we are seeking now. We might reach a time
                            when it is not possible to control those elements in our society any
                            longer. That is why we ask the two <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            negotiators, that they don’t allow that current of opinions to overcome
                            the present Government of Panama, because though it would be very hard
                            on Panama, it would be much more costly to the United States. These
                            individuals could paralyze the Canal operation at will in spite of the
                            efforts of our government. You are well informed of their existence, we
                            have always communicated with you whenever they have been arrested or
                            whenever they have planted in the Canal Zone or when they have attempted
                            to interfere with the operation of the locks. It is for these reasons
                            that we want to find a solution to the problem that we face and reduce
                            the possibility of having the country fall under another type of regime.
                            These threats are true facts of life in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>In other words our question, which we are posing to both of you now, is
                            the following: Is it possible to undertake a search for some formula
                            without immediate reference to an amount in dollars, that would permit
                            the Government of Panama to handle a sum of cash, which would make it
                            feasible for the treaty between the United States and Panama to succeed,
                            or do you feel it is not going to be feasible to find such a formula? I
                            very frankly have to say that we are going to have very hard and
                            difficult meetings during the course of the next week when we return
                            from Panama. We must be able to say that the economic arrangements do
                            not depend exclusively on income derived from tolls or on financial
                            loans. We must be able to say that it will be possible for the
                            Government of Panama to handle a certain amount of <pb n="198"
                                facs="0233" xml:id="pg_198"/>monies in cash. If you really feel that
                            this is going to be impossible, please tell us. We will quote you at our
                            meetings in Panama. I feel that if this is the case, I will not dare
                            continue negotiating with the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> on
                            this matter.</p>

                            reasonable. However, it would be crazy for us to say that if an increase

                            <hi rend="italic">ROYO:</hi> However, the economic team appears to be
                            operating with limitations. Regarding the intent, they are only looking
                            at financing loans and with very little money at that. Yet, that is not
                            why we are here. It is the political problem we are presenting here
                            which is the real one we have to deal with in Panama. To give you an
                            example, we have been told that some thought is being given to some kind
                            of corporation with a capital of $360 million. That the Panama Canal
                            Company owes the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Treasury a certain
                            amount. With this amount a joint or mixed corporation could be created.
                            The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> could contribute the Panama
                            Canal Company debt and Panama would contribute its natural resources and
                            its geographic location. The joint corporation with income from the
                            tolls, plus a yearly amount that the Panama Canal Company owes the
                            Treasury could provide a figure of about $65 million. This amount
                            resulting from tolls and income from the Panama Canal Company owed to
                            the Treasury, could be used for economic development projects in Panama.
                            It would, in addition, serve to obtain funds in the international
                            monetary market. This has been one of the possibilities that has been
                                stated.<note n="9" xml:id="d58fn9">See <ref target="#d58fn7"
                                    >footnote 7</ref> above.</note> However, this does not solve the
                            problem that we are bringing up today. Namely, the matter of a cash
                            compensation for the presence of military bases during a period of 23
                            years after the date of entry into force of the treaty. We sincerely
                            believe that it would be possible to find some kind of formula that
                            would accomplish this and would be acceptable to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> The answer to that question is the one
                            that we will need when we return to Panama to answer the first and the
                            last question that will be posed.</p>

                            insisting that those two should not be the only two alternatives. That
                            we must find another alternative to save the treaty. We cannot be
                            specific now as to the quantity, nor do we want to be. Because we would
                            wish the United States to propose the amount. How much you believe would
                            constitute a dignified cash consideration for Panama. We don’t want an
                            answer today.</p>
                        <p>One point which is of great importance is the form or manner in which you
                            undertake your consultations. If you state that in addition to the $45
                            million from tolls and the financing formulas agreed, should Panama
                            receive anything in addition, then the persons you talked to will
                            respond negatively. However if you consult them in terms of considering
                            not only income from the tolls or financing plans but what other
                            solution to Panama’s economic problems can be provided in view of the
                            presence of the United States military bases in Panama for 23 years, as
                            well as other privileges, and whether this would not justify a decision
                            of the United States Government to offer a just and reasonable
                            compensation, then the persons you consult will respond affirmatively.
                            As far as we are concerned, it all depends on the manner in which
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> undertake the
                            consultations and present the concerns and the message that Panama

                            appointment ends, I will be able to help you along on this issue. I just
                            wanted you to know that it is a six-month Presidential appointment that
                            I am serving under and I wanted to make you aware of the fact that it

                        <p>Invitations have also gone to two Defense officials—Canal Zone Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHR_1">Parfitt</persName> and General
                            Macauliffe, who heads the Southern Command. Defense intends to provide
                            only Governor <persName corresp="#p_PHR_1">Parfitt</persName>, who will
                            appear with the understanding that his testimony will be confined to
                            factual data on Canal operations and will not enter into the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the best solution would be to have Legal Adviser <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHJ_1">Herbert Hansell</persName> appear as the
                            Department witness. This choice can be justified on the basis of the
                            subject of the hearings. It will also facilitate confining testimony to
                            the legal/constitutional issues and avoiding discussion of the
                            negotiations. In addition, it will provide less of an incentive for
                            media attention than would an appearance by you or the negotiators. The
                            negotiators and L concur in this view.</p>

                            agreement on a treaty dimmed somewhat this week as Panama continued to
                            insist on an unacceptable high level of economic payments from the
                            United States and reopened, in some significant areas, the question of
                            lands and waters involving the military sector. On payments, Panama,
                            while showing some flexibility, continues to demand benefits
                            substantially beyond the Canal’s revenue generating capacity.<note n="2"

                            lands and waters issue stems from Panamanian National Guard efforts to

                        <p>Thank you for your letter of June 15.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">See <ref

                            Canal retains strategic and commercial importance for the United States.
                            I also clearly understand the concern that you and your colleagues have
                            expressed about negotiations on a new Panama Canal treaty, and I respect
                            the military judgments of the four former Chiefs of Naval
                                Operations.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">See <ref target="#d51fn2"

                            </note> My goals are the same—to preserve unfettered access to the canal
                            for our naval and merchant fleets. But I believe that the prospects for
                            attaining those objectives are poor if we simply insist on maintaining
                            the status quo.</p>
                        <p>We are negotiating because we want to protect our basic national interest
                            in Panama—a canal that is open, efficient, secure and neutral.</p>
                        <p>I intend that the new treaty will specify that the United States will
                            operate, maintain and defend the Panama Canal for an extended but finite
                            period of time. After the treaty’s termination, the United States and
                            Panama will ensure that the canal remains open to the ships of all
                            nations on a non-discriminatory basis. These provisions will be just as
                            binding as are those of the treaty presently in force between the United
                            States and Panama.</p>

                        <p>1. The interest payments—$18 million (which will serve as security for a
                            loan of $200 million.)</p>
                        <p>2. An Export-Import Bank pre-commitment to loan approximately $100
                            million.</p>
                        <p>3. An <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> loan guarantee of $20
                            million.</p>
                        <p>4. An <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> package of $80 million over
                            five years.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased taxes on <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> employees.</p>
                        <p>This package has not been put forward as a formal proposal, but the
                            problem is that it still does not come anywhere near satisfying the
                            Panamanians, who have asked for $150 million annually and $465 million
                            in a lump-sum payment. While not enough for Panama, this economic
                            package may, I fear, already be much more than what the Congress will
                            accept.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that a meeting of the National Security Council be convened
                            as soon as possible to consider the proposals on economic concessions,
                            to review the final negotiating instructions and provide guidance to the
                            Negotiators, and to decide on a final strategy for completion of the
                            treaty. If we have indeed reached an impasse, then the options for
                            trying to break it include:</p>

                            DoD and State—are singing the same tune. Otherwise we will certainly be
                            carved to pieces on the Hill. I believe you should consider talking to
                            the President rather than writing on this subject. We have a heavy
                            Panama schedule on the Hill next week—see the attached excerpt<note

                                outlined his proposal for a sea-level canal. His presentation
                                certainly gives one the feeling that we are spending a lot of energy
                                and political capital on the past rather than on the future as we
                                negotiate the Canal treaty. Gravel now recognizes, however, that
                                success in the present negotiations is critical to future good
                                relations with Panama.</p>
                            <p>I am sure Gravel reviewed the Congressional picture with
                                you—particularly his idea that we might sign the Treaty but not seek
                                a two-thirds vote in the Senate until we have paved the way with
                                some enabling legislation by majority vote in both Houses. Gravel
                                proposed a legislative package consisting of the following
                                elements:</p>
                            <p>—Pension and other labor legislation to reassure the Americans in
                                Panama,</p>
                            <p>—Authorization for a $7 million update on the existing sea-level
                                Canal studies,</p>
                            <p>—Authorization for the President to transfer lands, so that we could
                                begin to disengage even before the Treaty is signed,</p>
                            <p>—Provision for transferring some measure of responsibility for
                                operation of the Canal to Panama</p>
                            <p>—Toll increases to help Panama finance the cost of services for which
                                it will assume responsibility.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Gravel’s legislative strategy may have merit, and we will work out the
                            implications in detail. He believes the property transfer question can
                            somehow be buried in an attractive legislative package and slip by
                            without too much opposition; I am skeptical.</p>
                        <p>If we handle it creatively, the idea of a new canal in Panama could, I
                            believe, be helpful in gaining support for a settlement on the old
                            canal. People may feel more comfortable if they see the possibility that
                            we and the Panamanians may be building toward a promising joint
                            enterprise in the future rather than simply disengaging from an

                            relationship. We must not, however, allow the sea-level canal idea to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Last Round of Negotiations</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> began by
                            reviewing the latest round of the negotiations, which has focused on
                            economic arrangements. The Panamanians began with a proposal which
                            called for extremely large payments to the Panamanians; they have since
                            reduced their claims by <pb n="212" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_212"/>about
                            half, although it still remains too high for us. Our Negotiators
                            informed their counterparts that the President would only accept
                            compensation by way of toll increases, and they offered 25 cents per
                            canal ton (requiring approximately a 25 percent increase in tolls). They
                            have since increased their offer to 30 cents. This could probably
                            generate about $50 million in revenues to Panama, though no one can be
                            certain. It is possible that a further increase in tolls (two increases
                            in the past three years have totalled 50 percent) would generate lesser
                            revenues, perhaps a deficit. While raising tolls does not require
                            Congressional approval. Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1"
                                >Cooper</persName> pointed out that Congressional approval might be
                            necessary to get the increased revenues transferred to Panama.</p>

                        <p>In response to a question by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> on whether the part of the treaty dealing with the
                            transfer of lands and waters to Panama was completed, Deputy Negotiator
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> explained that
                            the Panamanians had just reopened that issue and made demands for bases
                            (including all those on the Atlantic side), which the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> consider essential for the defense of
                            the Canal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            explained that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> feels
                            that he needs the complete support of the National Guard to defend the
                            neutrality treaty, and thus he appointed Colonel <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Contreras</persName> has just upped the

                                discussed the treaties and stated that, “in the future, I would say
                                that we will need a sea level Panama Canal that can handle our large
                                warships and the large tankers and freighters that are part of
                                international commerce now.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                                1326–1327)</note> During the last round, the Panamanians asked to be
                            compensated for the right to an option to build a sea-level canal. The
                            Negotiators rejected that proposal, but in the light of the President’s
                            remarks, they believe the Panamanians will ask for more money for the
                            sea-level canal option. They are also concerned that it will hurt our
                            efforts to persuade Congress, which will wonder why a new treaty for an
                            obsolete canal is necessary. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                            Gravel’s proposal for enabling legislation to transfer some facilities
                            to Panama would delay and conceivably jeopardize the negotiations and

                            the questions—in particular, jurisdiction—that a new treaty would raise,
                            only it would call for two battles instead of just one.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he was not aware of
                            Gravel’s desire to delay the signing of the treaty, and he felt that
                            Gravel’s proposals for a sea-level canal were not yet finalized. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that the President’s
                            remarks could conceivably strengthen rather than weaken our bargaining
                            position vis-a-vis Panama. If a sea-level canal will be valuable and if
                            Panama cannot finance it without our guarantee, then our hand will be
                            strengthened, particularly when Panama realizes the money that will flow
                            into Panama during construction.</p>

                            which were suggested to Panamanian negotiators as a way to be responsive
                            to their economic demands. In addition to the annuity of $50 million
                            through the increase in the tolls, the “package” has come to
                            include:</p>

                            its size or per capita income would warrant. Representative Fascell
                            would need to be consulted on the HIGs because he is opposed to using it
                            for resource transfer.)</p>
                        <p>5. Use <hi rend="italic">$10 million of the interest payments</hi> to

                        <p>This summed to $495 million in loans and guarantees (without the <gloss

                                >Blumenthal</persName> said that the data on Canal revenues were not
                            adequate to judge how much a 30 cent per ton increase would provide in
                            revenues, and he asked who would pay for the deficit. He recommended
                            that we tell the Panamanians that we will not guarantee any revenues to
                            them.</p>

                            million loan (which would be financed by $10 million in interest
                            payments) would become a <hi rend="italic">grant</hi>, and all agreed
                            that he should be disabused of that impression immediately. <persName

                            military bases, but we have not responded yet. <gloss target="#t_Lt_1"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> reminded everyone
                            that the President has not yet approved any of this proposed package.
                            With the exception of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> loans, he
                            thought that the package would require Congressional consultations, but
                            not appropriations. Though Congress has not yet been consulted
                            comprehensively, he had a preliminary reaction based on conversations
                            with several Senators:</p>
                        <p>1. Loan money does not bother them.</p>
                        <p>2. Grants of money to disturb them.</p>
                        <p>3. They see <hi rend="italic">some</hi> justification for paying for
                            bases, though they believe the payment should be small.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that Congress
                            would accept the 30 cents per ton annuity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWM_1">Blumenthal</persName> said that he had just

                                >Allen</persName> asking him to testify on July 29 on whether it is
                            permissible to conclude an economic package separate from a treaty.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Allen</persName> clearly believes that
                            it should be part of the treaty, and all at the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> meeting agreed that for political purposes, it would be

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWM_1">Blumenthal</persName> asked the Negotiators
                            about the best kind of strategy to deal with the Panamanians: Should we

                            should we present our final, bottomline proposal to them, and make
                            crystal clear, that that is it? <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> recommended the latter strategy, and said that

                            said as much to him. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            said that we should present a firm proposal but retain a little

                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> wondered whether we

                            <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that a pause might
                            be interpreted as a break-off of negotiations, and it could very easily
                            provoke riots in Panama. <pb n="215" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_215"/>

                            it was “the reluctant consensus” that we ought to recommend to the

                            though there is some question about the exact elements and quantities.
                            The memorandum should include a comment on the likely Congressional
                            reaction to this package and also whether the Panamanians will accept

                            had been pushed too quickly to accept the package, and we should pause
                            to reconsider it. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said
                            that if we can justify it on its merits—basically the need to contribute

                            mature partner in the operation of the Canal—then we can sell it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we

                            confronted with the major issues of economic arrangements and lands and

                            30 cents per ton over the life of the treaty. At the same time Under

                        <p>The Panamanians originally sought an annuity payment of $300 million per
                            year and have now reduced it to $150 million per year. In addition they
                            originally asked for a $1 billion “down payment” which they have now
                            reduced to $460 million. The economic package which <persName

                        <p>Panama has been adamant in insisting on economic payments and

                        <p>Recently, Panama tabled a number of additional demands for military areas

                            and firmly that the Panamanian economic aspirations were “outside the

                            the Panamanians would be most surprised and disappointed. He said it was
                            imperative that General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            be personally informed of the United States position in an authoritative
                            fashion and suggested that this could only be done by a direct message
                            from you. He further said that he thought that unless such an approach
                            were taken it was “not only possible but almost inevitable that there
                            would be a rupture in the talks and that this might lead to confusion,
                            disruption and violence.” On the other hand, he thought that the course
                            he <pb n="221" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_221"/>recommended had a good
                            chance of defusing the situation and keeping the negotiations on

                            cleared by Jim Fallows. At Tab C is a summary of the <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>The reason for the urgency in sending the letter before you decide on the
                            final negotiating instructions is that Panamanian Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> believes it imperative that you
                            communicate directly with General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> about our position on economic arrangements. He
                            said that unless such an approach is taken, he believes it “inevitable”
                            that negotiations will break down. This is not the first time that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> has urgently
                            requested White House involvement, and as the intelligence report at Tab
                                D<note n="7" xml:id="d68fn7">Not attached. The intelligence report
                                is printed in <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> suggests,
                            his interpretation of recent developments does not appear to be
                            accurate. That report suggests that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> is prepared to conclude an agreement. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is indeed ready to
                            complete negotiations, then he must be basing his judgment on the
                            “package” which was suggested by our Negotiators in the last few weeks.
                            It is outlined as a series of “ideas” in the summary of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> meeting (Tab C, page 3).</p>
                        <p>The letter (at Tab A) is intended to be a general statement of support
                            for the Negotiators, but I believe it implicitly commits you to the <pb
                                n="223" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_223"/>“package” of proposals before
                            you have had an opportunity to review them. In the letter, you mention
                            that the formal proposals, which we will make, <hi rend="italic">will be
                                less than the Panamanians expect</hi>. That is the way the package
                            has been described to them in the past. The letter commits you to
                            “working as closely as possible . . . on improvement of Panama’s
                            economic health and development.” It also virtually bars any more
                            discussion of the lands and waters issue.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that you delay in communicating with <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> until you have had an
                            opportunity to review the current issues at stake. I do not think that a
                            delay of two–three days would in any way jeopardize the negotiations;
                            the far greater risk is that you send a message to the Panamanians,
                            which could be interpreted incorrectly.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">co-financing</hi> of revenue-producing capital
                            development projects in the Canal area. Projects would be selected and
                            developed by a <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian
                            government commission. The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> share of
                            co-financing (which would not exceed 50 percent of any single project)
                            would be lent by the Panama Canal Administration (<gloss
                                target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss>), which would borrow as needed up to
                            $200 million from the Federal Financing Bank (<gloss target="#t_FFB_1"
                                >FFB</gloss>). (Congressional authority would be required for this.)
                            The $200 million borrowing would be secured by the $20 million annual
                            payment from Canal Administration revenues which would be held in a
                            special account at the Treasury. Loan repayment schedules would provide
                            for project and <gloss target="#t_FFB_1">FFB</gloss> loans to be repaid
                            before the end of the treaty period. A variation on this arrangement
                            would allow the <gloss target="#t_FFB_1">FFB</gloss> to re-lend to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss> during the treaty period as
                            loans are repaid, as long as no more than $200 million in loans from the
                                <gloss target="#t_FFB_1">FFB</gloss> were outstanding at one time.
                            This variation would increase the total amount of finance available, but
                            would require that another <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> agency
                            guarantee repayment of amounts falling due beyond the treaty period.</p>
                        <p>b. Alternatively, the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> could offer
                            Panama an additional fixed <hi rend="italic">annual payment</hi>. The
                            money for this payment would come from the amount received annually by
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> from the Canal Administration.
                            Panama might attribute part of this payment as military base
                            “rental”.</p>
                        <p>We recommend that this payment be either (according to the judgment of
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators):</p>
                        <p>(i) $10 million per year ($220 million over the lifetime of the treaty),
                            or</p>
                        <p>(ii) $20 million per year, payable only if Canal revenues permit (up to
                            $440 million over the lifetime of the treaty.)</p>
                        <p>These two arrangements, 3a and 3b, share a common difficulty. The only
                            complete projections we have of Canal Administration revenues and
                            expenses show moderate losses during the early treaty years, and these
                            projections are not presently reliable with regard to revenues and
                            expenses over a greater number of years. Yet since 3a and 3b depend on
                            Canal revenues, their success could be threatened by the possibility of
                            losses.</p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_226"/>
                        <p>We would therefore take the following cautionary measures:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">With regard to the Federal Financing Bank co-financing
                                proposal</hi>: Should it not be possible to meet shortfalls by such

                            have at least an equal claim as Panama’s annuity payments on the Canal
                            Administration revenues. Thus, if the Canal Administration, in an <hi
                                rend="italic">in extremis</hi> situation, were forced to reduce
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interest payments that year,
                            Panama’s annuity payments should be reduced <hi rend="italic">pari

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">With regard to the fixed payment alternative</hi>, we
                            would offer Panama only half the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            interest payment—$10 million annually on a firm basis, or the full $20
                            million annually only if Canal Administration revenues permit. Treasury
                            opposes the former because it believes that if substantial deficits
                            occur and if costs cannot be cut or tolls raised further, the only way
                            to meet a fixed payment to Panama would then be borrowing from the
                            Treasury—which would mean that the payment would be financed from <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> rather than Canal revenues.
                            Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> favor the former because of
                            their view that a pledge of funds on an “if available” basis will be
                            unacceptable to the Panamanians so long as the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> maintains control of management of the Canal.
                            Furthermore, we believe that the remaining $10 million in interest
                            payments to the Treasury, combined with possibilities for cost-cutting
                            from current projections of Canal expenses or toll increases provide
                            ample assurance against the need to borrow to cover the $10 million
                            payment to Panama.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">In either case</hi>, payments not received by Panama
                            could be made up when Canal Aministration surpluses are sufficient to
                            cover them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>The package proposed by the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is
                            realistic in light of our constraints. It is also flexible in that it
                            can be tailored to Panama’s needs and aspirations, as well as its
                            capacity to absorb developmental assistance.</p>
                        <p>We have not, however, consulted Congress on the details of a financial
                            package, and would emphasize that consultation would be desirable before
                            the package is put to the Panamanians. Congress clearly does not relish
                            the idea of paying anything to give up the Canal, but this package,
                            consisting of loans and guarantees rather than grants, can probably be
                            sold on the Hill. Each element of the package expands the number of
                            committee jurisdictions affected, and therefore increases the
                            opportunities for hostile Members to attack the package. Fortunately,
                            however, treaty supporters will play major roles in the oversight
                            committees with jurisdiction over the package. For example, Chairmen of
                            the key subcommittees on Eximbank matters—Congressman Neal and Senator
                            Stevenson—are basically favorable to the treaty. And, as <pb n="227"
                                facs="0262" xml:id="pg_227"/>has been mentioned, Congressman
                            Fascell, who generally objects to the use of housing guarantees for
                            resource transfer purposes, is favorable to the treaty, and could well
                            drop his opposition in this case in deference to the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Panama has asked for a $460 million lump-sum payment at the treaty’s
                            start and annual payments of $150 million. In contrast, the suggested
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> position would provide Panama
                            no grants, but $300 million in loans and guarantees and annual annuity
                            payments of $45–50 million per year. This could be supplemented by
                            either $200 million of additional loan commitments or $220–440 million
                            in added annuity payments over the life of the treaty. While the package
                            is consistent with our objective of not paying Panama excessively (and
                            paying them only from Canal revenues), it is possible that Panama will
                            reject it.</p>
                        <p>In developing the recommended package, several additional elements
                                (<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>-supporting assistance,
                            Panamanian taxation of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizen
                            employees, and a larger annuity) were considered in order to make the
                            package more appealing to Panama. They were rejected, however, as too
                            politically sensitive or, in the case of a larger annuity, possibly not
                            supportable by Canal revenues.</p>
                        <p>Existing <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program levels will
                            continue to be recommended to the Congress. Increases of $5–10 million
                            in this program are possible, but have not been included because Panama
                            already has a high level of assistance relative to its size and per
                            capita income.</p>
                        <p>We believe that Panama’s current position is not its “bottom line.”
                            Whatever the case, ours is a reasonable offer. While Panama might not
                            accept that offer, we should make it to demonstrate our good faith and
                            reasonableness.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As a result of the discussions with the Panamanians on the various
                            elements of the economic package, our Negotiators believe that the
                            Panamanians <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> an economic package and that
                            negotiations would break off if we did not present one. So the issues
                            for decision have narrowed to:</p>
                        <p>• How big should the package be?</p>
                        <p>• What items should be in it?</p>
                        <p>As a way of underscoring the importance of these decisions, let me just
                            sketch very briefly two alternative scenarios which might follow from
                            these decisions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scenario I.</p>
                        <p>If you decide on a small package or, for that matter any package which is
                            not satisfactory to the Panamanians, then it is quite probable that
                            negotiations will indeed breakdown. With equally high probability, there
                            will be rioting in Panama, which will spill over into the Zone.<note

                            The Canal would be jeopardized and relations with Panama and all of
                            Latin America and the developing world would be seriously, perhaps
                            irreparably, harmed.<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">

                        <p>Our negotiators believe that if you accept the package recommended by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> that we could
                            justify that position internationally. They believe that the Latin
                            Americans will readily acknowledge it as a positive and reasonable
                            offer, and as a result, that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> will be forced to accept it.<note n="6"

                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scenario II</p>
                        <p>If you decide on the full package, and the Panamanians accept it, then it
                            is quite possible that the Senate would not ratify the treaty. All
                            agencies agree that the fight in Congress will be much tougher if such a
                            package exists. A defeat in the Congress on this issue will not only
                            jeopardize the Canal and our relations with Panama and Latin America;
                            because you will have to invest so much of your political capital in
                            this effort, a defeat might strike a significant blow at your overall
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the decision is a momentous one, and you might first want to
                            consult with the Vice President, who has been meeting periodically with
                            Senators to discuss this issue, and with <persName corresp="#p_JH_1"
                                >Hamilton Jordan</persName>, and also perhaps to speak with several
                            Congressional leaders (<persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Byrd</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CA_2">Cranston</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> will probably take the lead
                            on this issue).</p>
                        <p>The decisions become even more difficult when one examines the individual
                            elements in the package. <hi rend="italic">Raising tolls</hi> by 30–35
                            percent will cause serious economic and more serious political problems
                            with <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> (and foreign) shippers, who
                            still complain over the two toll increases (totalling about 50 percent)
                            in the past two years. On the other hand, the economists say that the
                            Canal would increase its revenue as a result of the toll hike, though it
                            is hardly certain that it will earn as much as $40–50 million.</p>
                        <p>On the other elements of the package—Eximbank, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> Housing Guarantees, <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss>, military assistance—we will clearly need more
                            detailed consultations, but the important point is that they will be
                            viewed as parts of an overall package with a bottom-line dollar figure
                            of $345 million (plus $50 million from tolls = $395 million). On the
                            question of the use of interest payments, both State and Treasury are
                            indifferent on whether we should use the $20 million to establish a $200
                            million co-financing scheme or as a fixed payment. The co-financing
                            scheme may not be acceptable to Congress, but the alternative of a fixed
                            payment provides the Negotiators with a fall-back position. Where State
                            and Treasury disagree is whether we should guarantee a fixed payment
                            (State prefers) or guarantee such a payment <hi rend="italic">only if
                                revenues permit</hi> (Treasury and I prefer).</p>

                        <p>The President told Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> that he could not in good conscience go to the
                            American people and explain to them <pb n="232" facs="0267"
                                xml:id="pg_232"/>that we are going to pay to give up the Canal. He
                            said that he could justify the sharing of interest payments, the
                            increase in tolls, and the loan guarantee package, but it was impossible
                            to go any further. He said that the total volume of the package should
                            include tolls. On the question of whether to give a fixed payment of $10
                            million out of interest payments or $20 million which would vary with
                            the level of revenues, he said that he would leave it to the
                            Negotiators, who are in a much better position to know. He said,
                            however, that he was eager to conclude a treaty.</p>
                        <p>In talking about the meeting, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> suggested that the President stress his
                            personal commitment to concluding negotiations and perhaps also mention
                            that we will want to continue our partnership after the treaty is signed
                            and to help Panama. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> then ran down the elements of the package
                            including the 30 cents per canal ton to Panama and the $10 million
                            interest payment, and the President said “that sounds good,” and agreed
                            that he would not get into the details of the package in his discussions
                            with the Panamanians.</p>
                        <p>The President also said that he wanted the meeting first, before signing
                            the letter, but that he would look at it and sign it in the
                                afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">See <ref target="#d72"

                            as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said, had
                            problems within Panama on the issues of neutrality, a <gloss

                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> will retain the dominant
                            position during the life of a treaty.</p>
                        <p>The President said that both sides could put a good face on the package.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> can talk about the
                            total package, and we can refer to annual payments.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Second Meeting</p>
                        <p>In the meeting with the Panamanian Negotiators, while the press was
                            there, the President expressed his deep appreciation for the superb work
                            which all of the negotiators had done, and to their leader, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, for his
                            constructive attitude toward the negotiations. The President said that
                            he is pleased with the great progress made in the negotiations and is
                            eager and determined to rapidly conclude an agreement on a new
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the major differences had been resolved, and he
                            hoped that the remaining items could be dealt with quickly. He said that
                            he would prepare a letter for them to take to Torrijos.</p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_233"/>
                        <p>The President remarked that the Panamanian and American people were aware
                            that negotiations had been difficult, but that all are eager to see the
                            treaty negotiations conclude to show that a strong autonomous and
                            independent Panama can work alongside a strong and independent United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>After the press departed, the President said that he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would both have a difficult
                            job trying to convince their people that a treaty is in the best
                            interest of both countries.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the remaining differences, which were primarily economic,
                            the President said that it would be impossible for him to convince the
                            American people that we are paying Panama to take a Canal which many
                            Americans believe is ours. He said that we could solve this problem by
                            giving Panama assurances of economic benefits that will meet their needs
                            and would be acceptable to the American people. He said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators will make a proposal in
                            the near future which will include toll fees and loan guarantees. There
                            is a great need to move rapidly to conclude negotiations so that the
                            Senate can ratify the treaties early.</p>
                        <p>Finally, he said that he wanted to extend his personal good wishes to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, and that he
                            wanted to sign a treaty in a way which would be good for <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and acceptable to the
                            American people.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Escobar thanked the President and said that his words confirmed what
                            the Panamanians had thought—that the President was determined to
                            conclude a treaty, and because of that greater progress was made in the
                            last six months than in the previous 13 years. He expressed his high
                            regard for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators, and his
                            optimism at the early conclusion of negotiations. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had asked him to tell
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that he would
                            be meeting in Bogota with the Presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Costa
                            Rica, Venezuela, and later Jamaica on August 5 to permit him to give a
                            detailed explanation of the negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">See

                            </note> President Oduber had called the night before to tell the
                            negotiators that he supported Panama’s position, but that he thought the
                            meeting could play an important role of informing public opinion,
                            particularly in the United States, of the realities in Panama and in
                            Latin America. Oduber had said that the meeting will reaffirm that the
                            fundamental problem in inter-American relations is the Canal. Also,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> planned to organize
                            the final signing of the treaty for all Latin American Presidents in
                            Panama.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> mentioned that the

                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military presence—but <pb

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he
                            would personally like to participate in the signing ceremony because he
                            would like the people of both Panama and the United States to see a

                            <salute>Dear General Torrijos</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I know you must be as pleased as I am that the negotiations between our
                            countries on a new Panama Canal treaty have made so much progress over
                            past months, and are now nearing completion. This historic treaty will
                            serve as an example to the world of how nations can work together for
                            the benefit of all.</p>
                        <p>You will be able to take great satisfaction in knowing that this historic
                            advance was achieved through your personal leadership.</p>
                        <p>Two most important issues remain to be resolved as we search together for
                            the fair and just treaty to which I am dedicated. They are lands and
                            waters, and economic arrangements. The United States has made a number
                            of major concessions in the lands and waters area during the past
                            several months. For my country to make any significant further
                            adjustments would handicap us unacceptably in operating and defending
                            the Canal.</p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_235"/>
                        <p>We are giving great thought to the question of economic arrangements, and
                            are taking into account your goals and aspirations. The proposals on
                            annual payments to Panama which our negotiators will soon present to
                            your representatives will be the product of intensive analysis and an
                            effort to be just and fair. The Departments of State and Treasury will
                            soon have responses to your request for economic help. These, too, will
                            be the result of very careful and thoughtful analysis.</p>
                        <p>It may be that these proposals will be less than you had expected or
                            wished, but I hope that you will understand that they represent the most
                            that we could undertake to do, based on our consultations with the
                            Congress. In my best judgment, the proposals will be generous, fair, and
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Once a treaty has been negotiated, we will be looking forward to working
                            as closely as possible with you on improvement of Panama’s economic
                            health and development. There will be many chances to cooperate
                            effectively as we operate, maintain, and protect the Canal together. We
                            fully intend to seize those opportunities.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that you understand the problems I face and the
                            difficulties that lie ahead of me. Please be assured that I, too, am
                            fully sensitive to the problems and difficulties that confront you.</p>
                        <p>I believe that, with understanding and patience, we can quickly achieve
                            the goal that has eluded past governments and leaders in both our
                            countries. I welcome the opening of a new era in our relations: one in
                            which our people will cooperate fully in civilian endeavors and in
                            military affairs.</p>
                        <p>I look forward with great anticipation to the day when you and I will
                            sign a great historic document that will make our countries and our
                            peoples real partners in the adventurous years ahead.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards.</p>

                            Notably, however, the Panamanians are no longer talking about a $460

                            <hi rend="italic">Panama</hi>. All Senators present agreed that the
                            Administration will have to do a good job of telling the country why the
                            new treaty with Panama is in <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            interests. This, as you know, has been a recurring message during my
                            consultations with members of the Senate. They believe the President and
                            the Administration will have to go to the people not only via television
                            from Washington, but also through “work in the hinterlands” to explain
                            the importance of the new treaty and the reason it is in our national
                            interest. Senator Nelson noted that while he has a flow of mail against
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panama negotiations, he has not
                            had a single letter in favor of the negotiations. Senator Stafford said
                            that if people in America, including people on the right, had a better
                            understanding of the specifics of the negotiations—including the fact
                            that American troops will be able to stay and the fact that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> will be able to intervene to safeguard
                            the canal’s neutrality after 2000—that there would be increased support
                            for the negotiations. The Senators want to be supportive, but they alone
                            cannot be expected to argue a new treaty’s merits. They believe the
                            Administration will have to take a strong lead.</p>

                            we believe it is entirely possible that agreement on a new treaty may be
                            reached next week when we will be in Panama.</p>
                        <p>On the economic issue, the Panamanians have abandoned their excessive
                            demands and are close to accepting our offer in the memorandum which you

                        <p>They have asked for modifications to our offer in order to reach
                            agreement. We recommend that you approve two changes which in our

                            may conceivably cause some problems with the Senate since it gives

                        <p>The 1970 Canal Studies Commission explored more than a dozen routes
                            through Nicaragua, Colombia, and Mexico as well as Panama, and
                            recommended the #10 route through Panama.<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">A
                                reference to the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Commission’s
                                report: <hi rend="italic">Interoceanic Canal Studies, 1970: Final
                                    Report</hi>. The Commission (also referred to as the Sea Level
                                Canal Study Commission) was established in 1964 to determine the
                                feasibility of a sea-level canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific
                                Oceans. The Commission was also charged with recommending the best
                                site for such a canal, its cost, and the best means of constructing
                                it, including the possibility of nuclear excavation.</note> There is
                            little likelihood that if we chose to build a sea-level canal it would
                            be anywhere else but Panama. Although it might be argued that the option
                            to build a canal in a third country gives us added leverage over Panama,
                            any hint of using such leverage would provoke such an adverse reaction
                            in Latin America that, in effect, we couldn’t use it.</p>
                        <p>We suggest you might want to speak directly with Ambassadors <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> on this. Essentially, the question at issue is
                            whether to adopt the provision in the status report or the proposed two
                            additions (<gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Panamanian). We
                            should add that the Panamanian Ambassador just told us that the four
                            Latin American Presidents (of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Mexico and
                            Colombia) “personally request” you to accept the Panamanian sentence (if
                            we insist on ours), and that our refusal would lead to a break in the
                            negotiations.</p>

                                Negotiators in Bogota and in Panama City. These conversations lasted
                                from about 6:30 to 11:30 p.m., involved discussion of all
                                outstanding issues, and brought us even closer to agreement on a new
                                treaty.</p>

                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Economic Arrangements:</hi> Panama will accept
                                our proposal (including use of an appropriate <gloss

                                subject to making up deficits from surplus in future years).</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lands and Waters:</hi> Most issues have now been
                                settled on the basis of our recent negotiating position. We have
                                agreed to explore under the treaty, settlement of remaining issues
                                which have been in our discussions, and expect no major difficulty
                                in their resolution.</p>
                            <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sea-level canal:</hi> The Panamanians this
                                morning proposed the following sea-level canal provision instead of

                                the possibility that in the future a sea-level canal in Panama may

                                after the Panama Canal treaty enters into force and during its
                                lifetime to study jointly the feasibility of a new interoceanic

                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is that the Panama Canal is a
                            major defense asset, the use of which enhances United States capability
                            for timely reinforcement of United States Forces. Its strategic military
                            advantage lies in the economy and flexibility it provides to accelerate
                            the shift of military forces and logistic support by sea between the
                            Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to overseas areas. United States
                            military interests in the Panama Canal are in its use, not its
                            ownership. Any new treaty must assure that access to and security of the
                            Panama Canal are protected in time of war and peace. This assurance may
                            be met by a permanent, joint <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Panamanian guarantee that the canal will remain open to all
                            world shipping at reasonable tolls, without discrimination, in
                            accordance with specific rules of neutrality agreed to in the guarantee,
                            and that Panama would take no action that would hamper efficient
                            operation of the waterway. The strategic value of the canal is not
                            expected to change substantially throughout the life of a new canal
                            treaty and beyond so long as it provides the sole means of transiting
                            ships across the American continent.</p>
                        <p>Defense of the Panama Canal has two components, i.e., internal security
                            and external defense. Internal security under the current treaty is the
                            responsibility of the Canal Zone Police and security forces reinforced
                            by United States military units assigned to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> Southern Command. Internal security is a problem of
                            surveillance and control. In a hostile environment, even under the
                            current treaty, continued operation of the canal cannot be guaranteed.
                            Under a treaty which recognizes Panamanian sovereignty and jurisdiction
                            over the canal, internal security would be the responsibility of the
                            Government of Panama which has a vested interest in the continued
                            operation of the canal. A period of transition would allow for a gradual
                            assumption of that responsibility by Panama. A permanent joint guarantee
                            of neutrality assures that the United States can act to protect its
                            interests if required.</p>
                        <p>External defense of the canal under the current treaty is the
                            responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. Current plans
                            provide for rapid reinforcement of Canal Zone forces from <gloss
                                target="#t_CONUS_1">CONUS</gloss>; the size and nature of these
                            forces are dependent on the threat. Under any new treaty, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will have primary responsibility for
                            defense of the canal in conjunction with the Panamanian Forces during
                            the period the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operated the canal.
                            The Panamanian Guardia Nacional and the appropriate United States forces
                            commander would develop plans in concert to provide for mutual defense.
                            Provision for reinforcement from the United States would <pb n="244"
                                facs="0279" xml:id="pg_244"/>continue to ensure the United States
                            interest in access to and use of the canal are preserved.</p>
                        <p>The preferred protection and defense of the canal would be in conjunction
                            with a friendly Panama. A new treaty which provides a basis for
                            development of a continuing friendly relationship between the United
                            States and Panama is of significant importance in insuring that the
                            Panama Canal will be available to the United States when needed. An
                            effective neutrality guarantee, in conjunction with <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> defense rights and military presence
                            throughout the period the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operates
                            the Panama Canal, would adequately protect <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> military interests.</p>
                        <p>Once the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> no longer operates the canal,
                            an effective neutrality guarantee will provide adequate basis for
                            safeguarding our interests in the canal.”</p>

                        <p>1. The President sent the following message to members of Congress by
                            domestic telegram Sunday evening, August 7.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin quote: Today Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                            negotiations for a new treaty may be concluded very soon. I believe you
                            will be gratified by the result and believe the public will find we have
                            achieved much more than had <pb n="245" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_245"
                            />been expected. I expect to be able to announce conceptual agreement
                            shortly, and pledge my best effort to show the public that the treaty
                            will advance our legitimate national security interests. I hope you can
                            support the treaty. In any case, I urge you to reserve judgment on it
                            until you have an opportunity to read the treaty, discuss with our
                            negotiators, and examine it in great detail. Once you have, I am
                            confident you will agree with me that the treaty will provide the best
                            defense for the canal and lead to improved relations with Panama, all of
                            Latin America and the Caribbean. Signed <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                            treaty has been gratifying. Your continued support will be essential to
                            achieve congressional approval of this historic treaty which I believe
                            will provide the best defense for the canal and will lead to improved

                        <p>The negotiators are encountering some new problems as they examine the
                            new Panamanian draft of the treaty. We do not yet have a sense of how
                            serious these problems are. In addition, the military negotiators
                            working on the land and water issues have encountered minor problems.
                            Under these circumstances, it would be best to hold off making any
                            telephone calls until we have further word.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Talking Points on Canal Treaty</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>We have reached agreement with Panama on the terms of a treaty to
                                guarantee and modernize the Panama Canal’s role as a neutral
                                international waterway open to all nations on an equal basis.</p>
                            <p>—Our main objectives are to keep the Canal open, operating
                                efficiently, neutral, and open to all ships on a nondiscriminatory
                                basis. The Canal cannot remain open for long or be operated
                                efficiently if we do not have the cooperation of the Panamanians
                                since the Canal is extraordinarily vulnerable. (One person carrying
                                a suitcase full of dynamite can blow up a lock or a dam and put the
                                Canal out of business for two years.)</p>
                            <p>—The 1903 Treaty with Panama no longer reflects the many changes that
                                have occurred in Panama, the United States, and the World. Today no
                                nation, including ours, could continue to accept a treaty which
                                permits the exercise of such extensive extra-territorial rights in
                                “perpetuity.” Last week, in Bogota, our closest friends in the
                                hemisphere—the democracies of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia,
                                Mexico, and Jamaica—issued a Joint Communique urging the United
                                States and Panama to complete and ratify this new treaty.<note n="5"

                            </p>
                            <p>—There are two parts to <hi rend="italic">our agreement:</hi> one
                                deals with the operation, jurisdiction, and defense of the Canal,
                                and it will remain in effect until the year 2000; the second part
                                will give us the right to guarantee the neutrality of the Canal
                                forever. During the 23-year lifetime of the basic Treaty, the United
                                States will retain the primary rights and responsibilities necessary
                                to operate and defend the Canal. But we will gradually seek to
                                increase the role of Panama in both the operation and the defense of
                                the Canal so that Panama will be ready to shoulder its full
                                responsibilities after the year 2000. Our job will be to help Panama
                                become a full partner. The Canal is their most important resource,
                                and they therefore have a strong incentive to see that it works
                                well.</p>
                            <p>—After the year 2000, the United States will not have the
                                responsibility to directly operate or defend the Canal, but we will
                                retain the rights <hi rend="italic">to take whatever action is
                                    necessary to guarantee its neutrality</hi>.</p>
                            <pb n="249" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_249"/>
                            <p>—At the Treaty’s start, Panama will obtain <hi rend="italic"
                                    >jurisdictional</hi> rights over the Canal Zone. The United
                                States will retain rights of criminal jurisdiction for <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> civilians over a three-year
                                period, and for our military during the life of the treaty (under a
                                status of forces agreement, as we have with all our military bases
                                overseas).</p>
                            <p>—The Canal will be <hi rend="italic">operated</hi> during the
                                Treaty’s lifetime by an organization in which the United States will
                                have effective control.</p>
                            <p>—The United States will continue to have access to all the <hi
                                    rend="italic">lands and water areas and defense facilities
                                    necessary</hi> for the operation, maintenance, and defense of
                                the Canal during the treaty period.</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">The United States will not have to pay any tax
                                    dollars</hi> to Panama. Panama will share in the toll revenues
                                (30 cents per canal ton, plus $10 million, plus an additional $10
                                million if revenues permit) and will receive approximately $295
                                million in loans, guarantees, and Export-Import Bank credits.</p>
                            <p>—Panama and the United States will jointly study the feasibility of a
                                    <hi rend="italic">sea-level canal</hi>, and if they agree that
                                it is necessary, we will negotiate terms for its construction.</p>
                            <p>I have no doubts that this treaty will provide for the most effective
                                defense of the Canal and will further our strategic, commercial,
                                economic, and moral interests. In addition, I am confident that the
                                new treaty will lead to closer political and commercial relations
                                with all Latin American and Caribbean nations.</p>

                            Upon arrival, they immediately proceeded to the White House Cabinet room
                            for an hour meeting with the President, Secretary <persName

                            Staff and assorted White House staff members. In the course of the
                            meeting, there was a detailed review of the principal provisions of the
                            new treaty. Near the close of the session, the press was called into the
                            Cabinet Room to overhear the President note the value of the new
                            agreement and praise <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and

                        <p>As you know, Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> have reached an
                            agreement in principle with the Government of Panama on the Panama Canal
                            Treaty, and have now reviewed the terms with me, the Acting Secretary of
                            State, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was
                            the unanimous conclusion of us all that our national interests will be
                            advanced by the terms of this agreement. The Joint Chiefs have been
                            represented in the negotiations, and give their unqualified support to
                            the terms of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>I will continue my review of these principles, and I expect to authorize
                            the completion of the formal treaty drafting.</p>
                        <p>This is a difficult political question, and I need your help during the
                            coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the treaties are essential to ensure the continued
                            effective use of the Canal for American commercial and security
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>You can call us directly with specific questions, but in the meantime I
                            am enclosing for your use a short summary of the agreement in

                            <p>The agreement envisions the possibility of building a new sea-level
                                canal. The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Panama will
                                jointly study its feasibility. If they agree that such a canal is
                                desirable, they will negotiate the terms for its construction.</p>

                            incorporated in the new treaty.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option No. 1:</p>
                        <p>“The Republic of Panama and the United States of America, foreseeing the

                            jointly the feasibility of a new interoceanic waterway on Panamanian
                            territory. Therefore, if the parties agree that such waterway is <pb

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option No. 2: Includes Option No. 1, plus:</p>
                        <p>“No new interoceanic canal will be constructed on the territory of the

                            provided or as the two governments may otherwise agree. During the

                        <p>In making your decision, you may want to take into account two items of
                            information, which will probably be known by avid opponents of a treaty.
                            First, under the Treaty of 1903 (Article V),<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2"
                                >The Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903.</note> Panama gave the United
                            States a permanent monopoly over the “construction, maintenance, and
                            operation of <hi rend="italic">any system of communication</hi> by means
                            of canal or railroad across its territory between the Caribbean Sea and
                            the Pacific Ocean.” This is one of many rights we will be giving up with
                            the new treaty.</p>
                        <p>From the other side, however, the Panamanian route for a sea-level canal
                            was judged to be the best. The 1970 Report of the Canal Studies
                                Commission<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">See <ref target="#d76fn4"

                            </note> chose among eight routes, and they follow in order of
                            preference:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1970 Prices</p>
                        <p>1. No. 10 Route—10 miles West of present canal (“the most advantageous
                            sea-level canal route”)—$2.9 billion</p>
                        <p>2. No. 14 Route—right alongside present canal (less desirable because it
                            would disrupt shipping during construction)—3.0 billion</p>
                        <p>3. No. 25 Route—through Colombia—would require nuclear excavation but
                            geological structure makes it unsafe (by nuclear explosions)—2.1
                            billion</p>
                        <p>4. No. 23 Route—through Panama and Colombia: By conventional means—5.3
                            billion With partial nuclear explosions—2.4 billion</p>
                        <p>5. No. 17 Route—in Panama (East of Canal): With partial nuclear
                            explosions—11.0 billion</p>
                        <p>6. No. 8 Route—Nicaragua and Costa Rica: By conventional explosions—11.0
                            billion By nuclear explosions—5.0 billion</p>
                        <p>7–8. Through Nicaragua and Panama—both were conventional lock-type
                            canals.</p>

                        <p>Given the strong recommendation of the Canal Studies Commission for the
                            Panama route and the importance which the Congress might attach to the
                            right of first option, it might make more sense to choose Option No. 2.
                            The disadvantage, of course, is that that option flags the entire issue,
                            which may conceivably not become an important issue.</p>

                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: We are very eager to have the treaty ratified by the
                            Senate. It would help very much, if you and I, under the auspices of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, invited the Heads of State of
                            the continent to witness the treaty signing ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>: I agree. I am ready to
                            cooperate in any manner that is necessary to insure that the treaty is
                            ratified as soon as possible. There is a problem however. It is my
                            feeling that if the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> were to issue
                            the invitations, fewer Presidents would be likely to attend the signing
                                <pb n="258" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_258"/>ceremonies than if it were
                            the White House that would extend the invitations.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: General, I am interested in having as many Presidents as
                            possible from Central and South America. If you and I jointly extend an
                            invitation and follow it up with personal messages to the Heads of State
                            I think we would achieve the greatest participation. I am planning to
                            meet first with you regarding the treaty and how it effects us and also
                            how it effects you in Panama. Then I also want to meet with the leaders
                            of the other countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">

                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ_1">Lopez Portillo</persName> did not attend
                                the signing ceremonies in Washington. In telegram 15000 from Mexico
                                City, September 7, the Embassy reported: “It now seems clear that
                                Mexico does not want to associate itself publicly in any way with
                                the neutrality agreement which has been publicly interpreted by
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> officials as giving the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> the right to militarily
                                intervene in Panama at any time after the year 2000 should the

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>: Now it is clear to me
                            what you propose to do. I think it is an excellent idea. I know that
                            between both of us we will get the largest number of Presidents of Latin
                            America to attend. It is important though that while the rest of them
                            decide on coming, that the first statements to the press be made in the
                            sense that a number of Presidents have already been contacted and they
                            have assured us they will attend. Then we would see what the other
                            Presidents would do because it would be in their own interests to
                            communicate their decisions.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. I think it would be advantageous if we were to
                            keep expectations low regarding the number that would attend so that the
                            public would be more surprised at the number in attendance. I am sure
                            that if we stated that twenty Presidents were to come, and only 14
                            showed up in Washington, D.C., the next day the headlines would read:
                            SIX PRESIDENTS REFUSE TO GO TO WASH<pb n="259" facs="0294"
                                xml:id="pg_259"/>INGTON, D.C. On the other hand, if the expectations
                            are kept low, and 14 Presidents and 6 Foreign Ministers attend the
                            ceremonies, the press and media would focus on that in a positive
                            manner. Therefore, I feel that public statements should be of such a
                            nature as to maintain expectations low, so that with the large number in
                            attendance, public opinion would be favorably impressed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>: I completely agree
                            with you. I believe that there is a political feeling in Latin America,
                            and it might be the case with you also, whereby the number of Presidents
                            attending might be thought of in terms of the goals scored in a soccer
                            match. It will be good to keep expectations low in statements to the
                            press. I do have a question though. That is, how many have already
                            confirmed their acceptances?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: First, let me say that I do not know yet. I believe about
                            six have already made definite plans. However, they have been somewhat
                            hesitant because the formal invitations have not been extended yet, and
                            no official date has been set yet. However, now that you and I have
                            agreed, I will undertake to make a maximum effort to contact directly
                            the Presidents inviting them to witness the ceremony of the signing of
                            the treaty, as well as to come to Washington to conduct other business.
                            We are also preparing a banquet at the White House on the 7th of
                            September, after the signing of the treaty, which I believe will provide
                            a delightful end to that day. During the two days thereafter, we will
                            have a chance to follow up in our talks with the various Heads of State
                            present. At this point, I think we have good indications that eight
                            Heads of State will be coming.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Leaders from

                            important that you make a statement in the sense that certain leaders,
                            without specifying their numbers, have been invited and will attend, and
                            that you announce the date. I have a suggestion to make also. That we
                            invite Canada. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TP_1"

                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it would be a great pleasure to do so. He also enjoys
                            great popularity in the United States, and I believe he should be
                            included. We feel that this is so important that it be publicized
                            throughout the country to the people that we are planning to have the
                            ceremony covered on live television in our country. We have not
                            approached the networks yet, but the possibility exists. I would like to
                            know whether you would have any objection to this?</p>

                            objection. The moment is of great significance for the Americas, and I
                            think it would be very advantageous to provide for TV coverage
                            throughout the Continent.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I would like to suggest that some key White House staffers
                            go to Panama with your Ambassador to arrange the details with you.</p>

                            the spirit of cooperation that has been shown by your Negotiators and by
                            you. My wife and I are looking forward to your visit to the White House.
                            Rosalynn was delighted with the complimentary remarks that you made
                            while she was on her trip of Central and South America.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>: Thank you, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. I want to tell you
                            that you have shown great moral courage by the way you have faced the
                            problems at hand. It was only with great moral courage that our ends
                            could be achieved.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I am proud of the progress we have made. There are a
                            number of things that you and the leaders of Latin America can do to
                            help us, and we are also eager to help you get your people to approve
                            the treaty. I hope your visit will allow us to establish ties of
                            personal friendship and understanding that will assure the approval in
                            the Senate and by the people of Panama. It is very important that our
                            citizens know that you and I have consulted and are ready to cooperate
                            in the future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>: I agree. Thank you
                            very much, Mr. President.</p>

                        <p>I was not in the room where the conversation took place but was able to

                            detailed explanation of how the two new treaties were negotiated and how
                            they would be applied. They furnished the Governor with the State
                            Department Fact Sheet and copies of their testimony before the Merchant
                            Marine and Fisheries Committee on August 17.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d83">Document 83</ref>.</note> Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> said that he would read the
                            material carefully before making any decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Governor had a list of questions from which he read. He had obviously
                            done extensive “homework” on the subject. He proceeded to voice his
                            objections to the defense aspects of the new treaties. He said that it
                            would allow even “enemy ships” to use the Canal in time of conflict. The
                            Ambassadors pointed out that the present treaty also grants that right
                            and that Japanese and German ships would have had the right through
                            international law to use the Canal during World War II. The Governor was
                            not aware of this, and he said that based on their explanation of the
                            neutrality treaty he was satisfied that the defense aspects had been
                            covered.</p>
                        <p>The Governor then went into the sovereignty issue. He said that it was
                            clear to him that the majority of the American people agreed with him
                            that we had sovereignty over the Canal Zone and that the original
                            negotiations begun in 1964 had given up our “hole card” by freely
                            agreeing that we would recognize Panama’s sovereignty over the Canal
                            Zone. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>
                            explained again that we do not <pb n="263" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_263"
                            />have sovereignty. Governor <persName corresp="#p_RR_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> said that the Spooner Act<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d87fn3">The Spooner Act of 1902 authorized President
                                Theodore Roosevelt to purchase rights for the purposes of building
                                the Panama Canal.</note> clearly stated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> was sovereign. The Ambassadors
                            responded that this has been reversed on a number of occasions by the
                            Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> said that if we
                            give in to Panama on the sovereignty issue every little country in the
                            world will get the idea that it can get its way by “tweaking our (the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>) nose.” He also said it would
                            be a signal to all the world of another <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> “retreat” under pressure.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said he
                            wished to make three basic points:</p>
                        <p>1. This is the first time we got a concession on neutrality in perpetuity
                            out of the Panamanian government.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> has never acted under duress
                            from Panama on a new treaty. We have stated many times that we have the
                            right to maintain the status quo under the 1903 Treaty, but we wished to
                            modernize an out-dated relationship.</p>
                        <p>3. The favorable reaction of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to
                            a new treaty will have a highly favorable impact on all of Latin America
                            and the rest of the less-developed world.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said he did not believe that the rest of Latin America was
                            solidly behind the treaty. The Ambassadors pointed out that we had heard
                            from many Latin American nations that they liked the fact that we would
                            maintain control for the next 23 years, and that they have all expressed
                            their satisfaction with the neutrality treaty in perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> then asked
                            the Governor what he would do if he had to make a decision on a new
                            treaty. The Governor said that he had no objection to a revised treaty
                            which would give Panama more income and possibly some more jurisdiction
                            in operation, but he would not give in on sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said he could not understand why we were agreeing to a
                            treaty which gave Panama the Canal, the Canal Zone, and were then paying
                            them large sums of money from a Canal which is not making money.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> told the
                            Governor that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government had
                            realized more than $642 million in interest payments during the years of
                            the Canal’s operation. What we are proposing to do is pay Panama a fair
                            rent for its territory which we are now getting for approximately $6 per
                            acre—the most valuable piece of land in the country. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> said he had no objection to a
                            just compensation.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said that he feared that a successor government to <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> might not abide by the
                            treaty. The Ambassadors told him this would amount to abrogation of a
                            treaty and we would then, of course, <pb n="264" facs="0299"
                                xml:id="pg_264"/>take any action we deemed to be necessary to keep
                            the Canal open to world shipping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> said that he suspected
                            that Communist influence was behind the “give-away”. He said that he had
                            first read of turning the Canal over to Panama in a Communist document
                            in 1932. He said he feared that the Panamanians would nationalize the
                            Canal as Nasser did in Suez. The Ambassadors reminded him that we still
                            have full control for 23 years under the new pact.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said he understood the problems the Ambassadors had in
                            negotiating because of all of the previous attempts at negotiating a
                            treaty and particularly because they had the issue of “sovereignty”
                            taken away from them as a negotiating tool.</p>
                        <p>He also said that the treaties described by the Ambassadors represented
                            the best “package” he had heard regarding a new treaty. He indicated
                            that he was still not satisfied but would think about their presentation
                            at length.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> then asked a
                            question which he qualified as being one which the Governor might regard
                            as being out of line. He asked the Governor if his decision would be
                            against a new treaty would he head an organization in opposition to the
                            treaty?</p>
                        <p>The Governor responded that he had no intention of becoming involved with
                            any organization, but that he would speak his convictions at any time he
                            was given the opportunity. He said he knew of only two formal
                            organizations—one headed by Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                                >Thurmond</persName> and another backing statehood for the Canal
                            Zone sponsored by a Southern California professor.</p>
                        <p>It was noted by the Ambassadors that the Governor did not bring up the
                            subject of Zonians or Canal Zone employee rights during the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The three participants agreed that the Ambassadors would tell the press
                            waiting outside the building that the Governor was giving full
                            consideration to the briefing and had had all of his questions answered
                            fully and to his satisfaction (not necessarily his agreement.) The
                            meeting lasted one hour and five minutes. The Ambassadors were quizzed
                            by the press and they stood by their agreement. One reporter asked if
                            they thought they had convinced the Governor and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said they had convinced the
                            Governor to consider their views.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Later in the day I called to talk with the Governor’s Public
                            Relations Advisor (Peter Hanniford) and by chance got <persName
                                corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> himself on the phone. I told him
                            about the press statements made by the Ambassadors and also took the
                            liberty of telling him that you had both been very impressed with his
                            reception of your presentation and his great knowledge on the subject.
                            He said to tell you that he had the <pb n="265" facs="0300"
                                xml:id="pg_265"/>highest respect and admiration for both of you and
                            knew that you were doing what you believed to be in the best interests
                            of the country. He said he regretted that he would be on “the other side
                            of the fence” on this issue.<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">In an August 25

                        <p>The President said that, after fourteen years, treaty negotiations on the
                            Panama Canal have been successfully concluded, and that he has just
                            received the final texts of the treaties. He commended Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Sol Linowitz</persName> for a superb
                            job and said that the treaties are very beneficial to the United States.
                            The treaties will be signed on September 7th at the Organization of
                            American States headquarters in Washington; 15 Latin American leaders
                            have already agreed to attend and more are expected to be present. The
                            President said that he will have bilateral discussions with all of the
                            Heads of State attending the signing. He asked Cabinet members for
                            suggestions as to appropriate topics that might be included in the
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>The President introduced Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1"
                                >Linowitz</persName> and asked them to comment on the treaties:</p>
                        <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said that there
                            are two treaties; a basic treaty which expires December 31, 1999, which
                            gives the United States primary responsibility for operation and defense
                            of the Canal during that time; and a second treaty which guarantees the
                            permanent neutrality of the Canal. Some of the major provisions of the
                            first treaty are:</p>

                        <quote>
                            <p>—That, with the participation of Panama, the United States can use
                                and share all land and water necessary to operate and defend the
                                Canal;</p>
                            <p>—That the Canal will be operated by a board of nine members—five from
                                the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and four from Panama;</p>
                            <p>—That the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> will administer the
                                Canal operations until 1990 and Panama will do so from 1990 to
                                1999;</p>
                            <p>—That no United States bases will be maintained in the area beyond
                                the year 2000;</p>
                            <p>—That United States employees in the Canal Zone will have rights
                                similar to <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> employees around the
                                world, as well as the right of early retirement; and</p>
                            <p>—That United States institutions and organizations will continue to
                                function as they presently do during the term of the treaty and
                                thereafter as other businesses do in Panama.</p>

                        <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that
                            the second treaty regarding permanent neutrality gives the United States
                            authority to assure that the Canal will remain open, accessible, secure
                            and efficient.</p>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that a third
                            set of issues involves economic arrangements. The Canal Commission
                            agrees to pay 30¢ per Panama Canal ton transiting the Canal, plus a
                            fixed sum of $10 million per year for operation of the Canal and up to
                            an additional $10 million per year if revenues permit. Arrangements have
                            also been agreed to concerning economic progress—up to $300 million in
                            loans and guarantees from the Export/Import Bank and similar
                            institutions, and as much as $50 million in foreign military sales
                            credits over a period of ten years.</p>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> said that there are
                            three additional important points to be made about the treaties:</p>
                        <p>1. The issue of the Panama Canal does not simply involve the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Panama; it is an issue which
                            affects the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and all of Latin
                            America. If a confrontation should occur, it would involve the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            <hi rend="italic">against</hi> all of Latin America. On the other hand,
                            if the issue is handled fairly, it will set an example for all of the
                            third world;</p>
                        <p>2. Our objective is to assure that the Canal remains open and accessible.
                            The greatest danger to this objective is to continue with an outmoded
                            treaty that is totally unacceptable to Panama;</p>
                        <p>3. The surest way to achieve that objective is to ratify a treaty which
                            reflects both Panamanian aspirations and <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interests.</p>
                        <p>—The President noted that following the year 2000, United States warships
                            will still have the right of expeditious passage through the Canal. He
                            added that efforts are underway to inform Congress thoroughly about the
                            issues, and that meetings with appropriate groups are being held
                            throughout the country. Former Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> were thoroughly briefed
                            and have endorsed the treaties. The President specifically asked for the
                            Cabinet’s help in securing ratification of the treaties.</p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="0303" xml:id="pg_268"/>
                        <p>—In answer to a question from the Vice President, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said that a sea-level canal is
                            being studied jointly with the Panamanians. Under the treaty, the United
                            States has the right to construct such a canal during the term of the
                            treaty with Panamanian consent, and agrees that it will not construct
                            such a sea-level canal in any other country.</p>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRS_1">Strauss</persName> raised four concerns
                            often expressed by people he talks to, and asked for Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>’s comments on each one:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Concern:</hi> We are giving away something that we
                            own.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> has never had sovereignty over the Canal Zone. The
                            original treaty granted us the “right, power and authority <hi
                                rend="italic">as if</hi> (we) were the sovereign.” After it was
                            signed, President Taft said that the treaty “seems” to preserve
                            Panamanian sovereignty. There are similar references in subsequent
                            administrations. A 1907 Supreme Court decision, <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WLH_1">Wilson</persName> V. Shaw</hi>, did
                            refer to <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> sovereignty, but a
                            subsequent decision indicated that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> has never been the sovereign.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Concern:</hi> Why cave in to the threats of a
                            dictator?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> We have never been threatened in
                            fourteen years of negotiations. We enter the new treaties because they
                            serve the highest and best interest of the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Concern:</hi> Even if the first treaty were unfair
                            to the Panamanians, giving the Canal back to Panama is comparable to
                            giving Alaska back to the Russians.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> We purchased Alaska and got the full
                            and complete “rights and appurtenances” to that land. In contrast, we
                            did not take sovereign title to the Panama Canal, and we have been
                            making annual payments for our rights of usage ever since the Canal was
                            built.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Concern:</hi> What happens if General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is overthrown and the next
                            leader of Panama repudiates the treaties?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> Panama has an excellent record of
                            abiding by the Canal treaty. In any event, the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> does not turn over complete control of the Canal for
                            twenty-three years, and if the treaty is abrogated by one party, it will
                            not be binding on the other. Thus, it is clearly in Panama’s interest to
                            adhere to the treaties.</p>
                        <p>—The Attorney General asked why we would have no <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> base in Panama after the year 2000. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> responded that <gloss

                                corresp="#p_BGS_1">George Brown</persName> say that such a base is
                            not necessary and might even be counter-productive.</p>
                        <p>—The President suggested that Cabinet members read <hi rend="italic">The
                                Path Between Two Seas</hi> by David McCulloch—an excellent history
                            of the circumstances and events surrounding negotiations of the first
                            Canal treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="0304" xml:id="pg_269"/>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ACD_1">Andrus</persName> said that the
                            briefing materials on the treaties recently circulated by the Cabinet
                            Secretary are excellent and should also be distributed to the press.</p>
                        <p>—The President noted that at the request of several Senators, the White
                            House has invited key delegations from some states to be briefed on the
                            treaties by the Secretary of Defense, Ambassadors <persName

                                Brown</persName> and key White House staff. Last Tuesday,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d89fn2">August 23.</note> delegations from Mississippi and
                            Kentucky were at the White House for a briefing, and delegations from
                            Florida and Georgia will be here tomorrow. A briefing is planned for
                                Thursday<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">September 1.</note> for groups
                            from West Virginia and Arkansas.</p>
                        <p>—The President said that a vote on the treaties will not be later than
                            February of next year but could come earlier if it appears that we have
                            the necessary votes.</p>
                        <p>—The President reiterated his commendation and thanks to Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> for their excellent work.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Panama.]</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. Schultze briefly outlined some statistics concerning economic
                            relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Latin
                            America, all of which underscore the importance of the Panama Canal
                            treaties. United States’ assets in Latin America in 1975 were $68
                            billion, of which $22 billion was direct investment. That money earns
                            approximately $5 billion per year, and the return increases each year.
                            Approximately $17 billion of goods are directly exported from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to Latin America each year, with an
                            additional $4 billion in non-tangible exports. Imports from Latin
                            America approximate the same monetary value. Most of the imports are raw
                            materials (e.g., 25% of our steel-making ingredients; 41% of our lead;
                            17% of our tin; 21% of our copper; and 27% of our non-ferrous

                        <p>This memorandum provides a brief description of the Department of
                            Defense’s past use of the Panama Canal and the canal’s potential impact
                            on defense planning for various conflict scenarios.</p>
                        <p>United States’s military use of the Panama Canal has two broad strategic
                            aspects:</p>
                        <p>—Interoceanic transfer of warships and their supporting auxiliaries.</p>
                        <p>—Logistical support (movement of supplies and equipment) for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and allied forces in Europe and the
                            Pacific.</p>
                        <p>A review of historical data shows that during a nine year period of the
                            Vietnam conflict, 1964–1972, the canal averaged 123 warship and 645
                            military logistical transits (about four million tons of military cargo)
                            per year. For the four year period between 1973–1976, the averages for
                            warship and logistical transits were reduced approximately two-thirds to
                            42 and 219 (about one million tons of military cargo) respectively.
                            During the peak 1967–1969 period, approximately 49 percent of all <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government cargo arriving in Vietnam
                            passed through the canal. The highest this figure ever reached was in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1968 when 69% of this type of
                            cargo passed through the canal. These figures represent all naval ship
                            transfers between the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The largest naval
                            transit was the 39,000 ton amphibious assault ship <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>Our planned wartime and contingency use of the canal (Tab B provides
                            details and is classified SECRET)<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">Attached
                                but not printed.</note> is based on a strategy which permits rapid
                            augmentation of forces in the Atlantic or Pacific theaters. Canal use
                            improves availability of surface escorts, amphibious shipping, and
                            logistical support. Its use reduces transit times and this equates to
                            increased defense force availability in the early period of a conflict.
                            Current planning reflects programmed use of the canal; however,
                            alternate routes and measures are part of military planning in the event
                            the United States is denied its use. Attack carriers and their escorts
                            already use routes such as those around Africa and South America
                            although this adds an average of 15–21 days to their transit time.</p>
                        <p>In a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> conflict, significant numbers
                            of cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and a substantial portion of
                            amphibious lift for Marine Corps forces would transit the canal. This
                            would reduce the time to achieve availability by 15 to 21 days for the
                            Atlantic-Mediterranean theaters when compared to ship transits which did
                            not use the canal. The canal also assists in the movement of military
                            cargo from West Coast ports and facilitates the assembly of shipping in
                            the Atlantic. The use of the canal results in a net increase in cargo
                            capacity of 30 percent during the first month of mobilization.</p>
                        <p>The escort requirements are not as significant in a Pacific only
                            scenario. However, because of West Coast port limitations (safety and
                            capacity), current plans require approximately 75 percent of certain
                            critical cargo to be shipped from the East Coast during the first thirty
                            days of a conflict in the Pacific. During the 60-day initial period, use
                            of the canal facilitates assembly of shipping and improves delivery of
                            critical cargo by 18–25 percent. The canal also reduces the time
                            required to assemble amphibious shipping by approximately 30 percent.
                            Tab B provides a classified examination of the effect of canal closure
                            on operation plans.</p>
                        <p>The paper does not address long term alternatives which might be
                            undertaken to compensate partially for the unavailability of the canal.
                            In sum, assured ability to transit the canal remains of military
                            importance, though rather less than in the past. Therefore, the
                            principal military interest is to assure that ability. I agree with the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> that the proposed canal
                            treaties are the best way to do so.</p>

                        <p>(C) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed drafts of the Treaty
                            Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,
                            27 August 1977, and the Panama Canal Treaty, 27 August 1977, and the two
                            accompanying agreements in implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty.
                            Based on their assessment of the military and national security
                            implications of these treaties and agreements, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            support the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of
                            the Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Treaty.</p>

                        <p>The President welcomed General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and the members of his delegation. He said it
                            was gratifying to know of the cooperation that all Panamanian officials
                            had demonstrated this year in support of the new treaty. He said he
                            wanted to offer his personal thanks to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> particularly for his
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>Noting the presence of many Latin American leaders, the President hailed
                            this as “a great demonstration” of their interest and support. He said
                            their appearance was a great personal tribute to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> as a result of his contacts
                            with them and his encouragement of their support over the past year. The
                            President said he thought their presence would be a great help to us in
                            underlining the importance of the issue to Latin America as we take this
                            matter to the American people. He said he hoped that TV coverage of the
                            signing ceremony would be carried live to Panama, and asked if that
                            would be the case.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said it would
                            be.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought that the ceremony would be a great help to
                            him in getting the Senate to ratify the treaty. It would also help
                            demonstrate to the people of Panama the great interest of the Hemisphere
                            in the treaty. He asked when the plebiscite would be held in Panama.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> noted that there
                            would be a huge manifestation of support from the people when he
                            returned to Panama. He said he planned to hold the plebiscite on October
                            23—a Sunday. He said he wanted to have the plebiscite when the students
                            were in school and <pb n="277" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_277"/>during the
                            rainy season—in other words, the most difficult conditions for a smooth
                            vote. If the Panamanian people voted for the treaties in these
                            conditions, it would be another significant example of their support. He
                            said he had been advised to hold the plebiscite when the students
                            (potential opponents) were on vacation and after the rains had stopped.
                            He rejected this advice.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked what he
                            thought the chances of success were.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he was going to
                            travel throughout his country—by helicopter, by horse, on foot—to make
                            the case to his people. His basic argument, he said, would be that it
                            was not perfect but that the new arrangement was vastly better than what
                            they now had. He estimated that some 900,000 of his people would vote—of
                            a 1.7 million population. Many young people of 18 would be voting for
                            the first time in their lives. He said it was important to get the
                            largest possible turnout.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked what we in
                            the United States could do to convince the Panamanians that the treaty
                            was good for them, for us, and for all the people of the world.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> replied that “what we
                            are doing now is very important.” (By this, he meant the White House
                            meeting, the Washington signing of the treaties, and the gathering of
                            Latin American leaders.) <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> said it would be helpful if he could carry back
                            to Panama with him a letter from the President so he could deliver the
                            message in person to his people.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> He noted that both the
                            United States and Panama were “selling the same product” but were doing
                            so in two different markets. The President laughed and agreed that both
                            countries had difficulties. He said the two would have to use two
                            different advertising campaigns with their respective markets.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought we had a good chance to secure
                            ratification. Support of the Senate was essential, but he said good
                            progress was being made. He noted that the signing ceremony on
                                Wednesday<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">September 7.</note> would be
                            very important and that all the Senators had been invited to attend. He
                            told <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> that last year
                            some 40 Senators had signed a resolution opposing the treaty.<note n="4"

                        <p>The President noted there was great interest in the Hemisphere in the new
                            treaty arrangements and in the mutually beneficial terms thereof. He
                            said everyone wanted a peaceful solution. He thought there was a good
                            chance to win ratification. He told <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that the public <pb n="278" facs="0313"
                                xml:id="pg_278"/>statements the Panamanian leader would make during
                            these days would be most important here.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said he wanted
                            to say in close touch with General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> as we move forward—either directly or through
                            their Ambassadors. He said he did not want to say anything that would
                            make things more difficult for <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> in Panama. It was important, he said, to
                            maintain a close coordination. He said there was one additional
                            factor—the great public awareness here of the constructive statements
                            the General had made. He said it should be clear that neither side had
                            been negotiating under pressure or the threat of violence. The key
                            element was that the treaty was good for both sides. He said the press
                            had covered the story very well and that had been important.</p>
                        <p>The other benefit the President could see was that the treaty opened the
                            way to an era of close cooperation and friendship between Panama and the
                            United States. He said it was helpful to us here for people to
                            understand that—and possibly in Panama, too. He said he hoped the treaty
                            would be only the first step in a process of cooperation and friendship
                            in the years to come.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he wanted to be
                            absolutely frank. He said he never thought we would get to a final
                            treaty. Always in the past, he said, we had talked around it—we never
                            got down to the real issues. He said Panamanians could never understand
                            such things as having United States police arresting their young people.
                            Now, he said, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            had come up with a new philosophy and attitude. He realized that “some
                            people” did not like it. But he said it was “an act of valor” on the
                            part of the President. He said he had not, before his present visit,
                            understood the depth of the problem here. Now he understood.</p>
                        <p>He said he was confident that the treaty would open a new relationship
                            with Latin America. In the past, it had been Latin America’s impression
                            that the United States was the “rich brother.” You sleep with us but you
                            live in Europe, he said. He said it was not difficult for the United
                            States to improve its relations with Latin America. He said he didn’t
                            believe it meant spending more money than at present; what was needed
                            was a new philosophy and to pay more attention to them and their
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he was optimistic
                            about the treaty being strongly ratified by the people of Panama. He
                            said that “perpetuity” now had a final date. Each of the things that
                            have been hateful now has a “birth date” (he meant termination
                            date).</p>
                        <p>The Panamanian leader said he had profound admiration for the President’s
                            honesty and political valor. He said no one else would have had the
                            courage that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            had shown. He said it was almost like jumping from an airplane without a
                            parachute to take on this battle.</p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_279"/>
                        <p>The President said he felt the treaty was the right, fair and decent
                            thing to do. He said the American people are fair and decent. He said he
                            thought the treaty would be ratified. He promised to expand any effort
                            to bring this hope to reality. He felt certain it would eventually prove
                            to be a popular accomplishment for him and his Administration. He said
                            the climate would improve as the American people came to understand the
                            terms of the treaty and to realize the unfairness of the past. He said a
                            reasonable settlement was in the character of the American people. He
                            said he had great admiration for General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> for acting so patiently.</p>
                        <p>He said the treaty opened the way to a new era of mutual respect,
                            equality and friendship between our peoples. He said he believed that
                            Torrijos’ leadership would be an example to other leaders to meet and
                            discuss their differences in a spirit of cooperation using the examples
                            of the Canal Treaty. He referred specifically to Chile, Peru, Bolivia,
                            Ecuador, El Salvador and Honduras, Guatemala and Belize.</p>
                        <p>He said that Latin American leaders owe to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and the people of Panama a debt of gratitude.
                            The signing offers all the leaders a unique opportunity. He said he
                            would appreciate Torrijos’s views on how best to use the present
                            gathering of leaders to best advantage. He noted that he had emphasized
                            the importance of the human rights issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he had spoken to
                            several of the Latin American leaders. He said they have come with the
                            attitude of people who knew that nothing was wrong (in their own
                            policies). The fact that the President had adopted a policy of human
                            rights had eased the problem for many. He noted that some of them had
                            instructed their organs of investigation to change their methods. He
                            noted that he had had a good talk the previous night with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">George Brown</persName>.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d94fn5">No record of the conversation with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> has been found.</note> He
                            felt the General would have considerable influence with Latin American
                            leaders, particularly the military leaders. He noted the problems of El
                            Salvador and Honduras and of Peru, Chile and Bolivia. He said that in
                            many countries the arms race was being confused with the countries’ real
                            problems. (The clear implication was that Latin American governments
                            should be spending less for weapons, more for their people.) He said
                            that Honduras and El Salvador would get into some kind of agreement,
                            indicating the United States should play a role.</p>
                        <p>Going back to the arms race, he said many countries were arming
                            themselves against the Communists “in the name of the United States”—in
                            other words, claiming they were serving our overall strategic interests.
                            The result was that these countries were carrying on violence in the
                            name of the United States. He said our contacts with <pb n="280"
                                facs="0315" xml:id="pg_280"/>the above-mentioned countries on these
                            problems should be strictly private. He suggested that the
                            President—after these first contacts and laying down the United States
                            position—should call the Latin American leaders together and ask them
                            how things were going and if they were making progress on the matters
                            discussed. In the case of El Salvador and Honduras, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said it was the poorest
                            people who suffered but that none of the oligarchy suffered at all. The
                            poor go into the Army, he said, but the rich do not.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if that meant that if he were to talk to some Latin
                            American leaders about peace and less arms they would not be
                            offended.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said quickly that they
                            would certainly not be offended. In fact “they are almost wishing you to
                            do that.”</p>
                        <p>The President said he would be meeting with most or all of the heads of
                                state.<note n="6" xml:id="d94fn6">See <ref target="#d85fn2">footnote

                            </note> He would take up such matters as Bolivia’s access to the sea, a
                            solution to the Honduras-El Salvador war, Ecuador’s access to the
                            Amazon, the arms race. He asked whether El Salvador and Honduras had
                            relations and was told they do not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said there were many
                            factors at work. He noted that the Inter-American highway passing
                            through El Salvador could not be used by Honduras and this created a
                            serious economic problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would do the best he could. He told <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> he liked his advice at this
                            meeting and would like it to continue. He said the Panamanian leader
                            understood Latin American problems and differences better than he did.
                            He said he thought this would be a week of celebration. He hoped his
                            visitors enjoyed their stay in Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that once the new
                            treaty went into effect it would be important that the high elements of
                            both governments dealing with the Canal matters should be the best. He
                            urged the President to send people who had the kind of mentality that
                            recognized this as the beginning of a period of change. Right now, he
                            said, there were two different attitudes existing in the Canal Zone—some
                            were okay, but others felt they should maintain the status quo. He said
                            there were people “who would like to stop history with their hands.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said he would be
                            sure that this treaty—once it is in effect—will be carried out fairly
                            and in an orderly way. He noted that he had received the support of the

                            Chiefs of Staff. He said the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> were
                            prepared to work with him, especially in the changing over of defense
                            requirements to the National Guard. He said the basis had been laid for
                            an orderly and peaceful transfer.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> that
                            if the latter detected any problems as time went on he hoped the General
                            would let him know so that he could take appropriate action. He said
                            that on the day the treaty became effective he would be sure, in his
                            statements, that it was not a reluctant transfer of authority but an
                            enthusiastic one. He said he thought that would help induce an
                            appropriate attitude on the part of Americans in the Zone.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he would do the
                            same. He noted, for example, that he had been talking with the President
                            of the Canal Zone Pilots.<note n="8" xml:id="d94fn8">A reference to John
                                Williams. See <ref target="#d94fn7">footnote 7</ref> above.</note>
                            He said there was agreement on the need to set up a school for training
                            Panamanian pilots and that would be done. But he thought that some
                            individuals might try to stop the operation of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought the public attitude on his part and that of
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was most important.
                            He said he felt that if American citizens involved knew that he wanted
                            to cooperate, they would want to do so, too. We have to establish a
                            system of cooperation and coordination, he said, to avoid problems. We
                            must work to see that little problems do not become big ones. We can do
                            many things while we are in office so that our successors will have
                            fewer problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that was a very
                            good idea.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said he looked
                            forward to the ratification of the treaty and its implementation. It
                            will be good for you and good for us. He hoped there would be a chance
                            for their personal friendship to develop in the time ahead. He said he
                            would celebrate the achievement you (Torrijos) have been instrumental in
                            bringing into effect.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he had a couple of books he wanted to give to the
                            General—a copy of <hi rend="italic">Why Not the Best</hi> and a volume
                            of photos <pb n="282" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_282"/>from outer space
                            (including a picture of Panama). He commented that his book was “not
                            very good” but that it had sold well—after he was elected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> thanked the President
                            warmly.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> then said
                            he had a gift—an autographed baseball bat from Rod Carew of the
                            Minnesota Twins (and a Panamanian). He suggested that by giving away a
                            bat he was indicating that we no longer have to carry “a big stick.”</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended on this cordial note. The President accompanied General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> to his waiting car,
                            where they shook hands and said goodbye.</p>

                        <p>This has been an historic week for our two countries and for all the
                            peoples of the Americas. The treaties that we have signed mark the

                        <p>On your return to Panama, I would appreciate it if you would convey to
                            the people of Panama my warmest good wishes and those of the American

                        <p>The road to these treaties has been long, and our journey has not been
                            easy. The pledge to work out a new agreement to replace that of 1903 was
                            first made to your country by my predecessor, President Lyndon

                        <p>—The President said that our efforts to persuade the public and the
                            Congress that the Panama Canal treaties should be ratified are
                            continuing with considerable success. He noted that a recent Gallup Poll
                            shows that 39% of the public favors ratification compared with 8%
                            earlier this year.</p>
                        <p>—He observed that there was an unprecedented demonstration of the quality
                            of respect between the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and the
                            various Latin American countries which were represented at the signing

                            extremely important to the continuance of those relationships.<note

                            used threatening tactics of any kind in order to obtain concessions. The
                            Panamanian negotiators were persistent and fought hard for the best
                            bargain they could obtain, but never resorted to such improper
                            negotiating tactics. Moreover, it was clear that they were prepared to
                            take whatever time was necessary to reach an agreement which they
                            considered acceptable.</p>

                            toughness of our position and their possible response. But neither in
                            the negotiations nor in Washington consideration of these issues did
                            this factor have any role or effect whatsoever. In fact, the United
                            States continued to maintain its position which had so exercised the
                            Panamanians until it was the Panamanian side which conceded.</p>

                        <p>As the debate on the Canal Treaties intensifies, the Administration will
                            need to be able to respond quickly and accurately to arguments made by
                            those who oppose the new treaties. An incorrect response or a flawed
                            argument could be extremely costly not only in terms of disseminating
                            inaccurate information, but more importantly, because it could put us on
                            the defensive and leave the erroneous impression that we haven’t
                            adequately reviewed the treaties or that we aren’t on top of the
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>We expect that Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>

                            Office in the State Department should have primary responsibility for
                            responding to facts or arguments generated by the treaty’s opponents,
                            but there are many other people in the Administration who are regularly
                            asked questions about new facts or arguments and need to be prepared to
                            respond. We therefore suggest that the Panama Canal Task Force in State

                            endorses the Panama Canal treaties. The President commended the
                            Senator’s “extraordinary demonstration of courage” in view of the fact
                            that the senior Senator from South Carolina is one of four outspoken
                            opponents of the treaties.<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">A reference to

                                >Hollings</persName>’ support followed his recent visit to Panama
                            and his discussions of the treaties with several Latin American
                                leaders.<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">In telegram 6206 from Panama

                                William R. Scott (R–VA) also attended and expressed his opposition
                                to the new treaties. <persName corresp="#p_HEF_1"
                                    >Hollings</persName> did not commit himself to a position on the
                                trip, but “showed a considerable curiosity about political
                                conditions in Panama and the probable effect of a new treaty here.”

                            that other Senators may also make trips to Panama in an effort to learn
                            first-hand as much about the whole subject as possible.</p>
                        <p>—He added that he is still deeply committed to securing ratification of
                            the treaties, and that he works on the effort every day. He asked the
                            Cabinet members to continue their efforts to secure ratification and to
                            commend those Senators who have endorsed the treaties.</p>
                        <p>—Mr. Bergland noted that the farm community is generally quite supportive
                            of the treaties; the President suggested that Mr. Bergland pass on that
                            information to <persName corresp="#p_MF_2">Frank Moore</persName>.</p>
                        <p>—The President said that a briefing on the Panama Canal treaties with 150

                            this past week on the Canal treaties, and that the Senator is working on
                            the telephone to persuade his colleagues on the need for
                            ratification.</p>

                            from constituent groups for the treaties. The President answered that
                            those efforts should be undertaken immediately and noted that his own
                            activities were proceeding on two fronts: private meetings with Senators
                            and with groups of leading citizens from various states; and planning

                            to Andres Aguilar, Chairman of the Commission. The Deputy Foreign
                            Minister of Panama is apparently a close friend of Andres Aguilar, and
                            he, as well as other Panamanians, have been trying to phone Aguilar
                            without success to work out a convenient time for the visit.<note n="3"

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> concluded that Aguilar
                            was trying to avoid the issue, but he did not know why. He was worried
                            that Winston Robles, a conservative Panamanian currently in exile, and
                            other Panamanians in exile, may have tried to contact Aguilar in an
                            effort to become members of the visiting Commission. <persName

                            joking mood, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that
                            he was keeping one well-fed political prisoner in the prisons so that
                            the <gloss target="#t_IACHR_1">IACHR</gloss> could release him and

                            that <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> had sent him. That
                            message was essentially the same one that we had heard from Senator

                            the Hemisphere that he is willing to wait until it is ratified. He
                            expected the normalization of relations between the <gloss

                        <p>In my initial conversation with <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>, I brought up a case which had been brought to
                            my attention during the previous week. The Boston-Panama Company, a
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> company which had extensive
                            property holdings in Panama, had been subject to what it considered a
                            discriminatory and unreasonably high tax. Over several decades, the
                            Company had contested the tax in court, sometimes obtaining some
                            satisfaction, other times none. Finally, in 1969, while the case was in
                            the Appeals Court, the Company counsel was replaced by someone
                            unfamiliar with the case, and the courts decided to pay the tax owed by
                            the Company by auctioning the property. The Panama Government was the
                            sole purchaser and when the Company protested, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> broke off negotiations and
                            made a “political decision” not to deal with the Company anymore. Within
                            the last year, the Company has decided to exploit the sensitivity of our
                            relationship during the treaty negotiating and ratifying process and
                            have sought from Congress and the State Department to have sanctions
                            imposed (the Hickenlooper-type Amendments on foreign aid and <gloss

                        <p>In order to try to head-off any complications with the Senate on this
                            issue, and after extensive conversations with State Department lawyers,
                            I raised the issue in the following way. I said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not wish to make a determination
                            at this time on the merits of the Boston-Panama case. Whether or not
                            they have a good case, however, is not so important as the political
                            implications of the Company applying pressure on the Congress at so
                            sensitive a time in the ratification process. It therefore seemed to me
                            to make eminent sense for the Panama<pb n="294" facs="0329"
                                xml:id="pg_294"/>nian Government to reopen negotiations with the
                            Company as well as permit them access to Panama’s courts. I said that I
                            thought that is all that the Company wants right now, and even if Panama
                            did not believe that the Company had a good case, still it appeared to
                            me to be in Panama’s interests to open a dialogue, particularly since
                            judicial proceedings would probably extend beyond February or March of
                            1978—after the expected time of ratification of the Treaties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> listened very closely,
                            appeared to be pleased that I was not making a case on behalf of the
                            Company but rather on behalf of a smooth ratification process, and said
                            at the conclusion of my remarks that he “heard my message.” The clear
                            implication to all of us was that he would indeed instruct his advisers
                            to reopen negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Manfredo</persName>, the Minister to the Presidency, and with

                            agreed that <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> would be in
                            touch with the Company’s American lawyers and reopen negotiations. A

                                >Torrijos</persName> had distinct views on every one. On Bolivia’s
                            goal to have access to the sea, he said that he had spoken with Banzer
                            and outlined the strategy that he had pursued in raising international
                            consciousness to the importance of the Canal Treaty negotiations. He
                            suggested a similar strategy be used to focus attention on Bolivia’s
                            problem. The first step called for Bolivia to get a seat on the <gloss

                            discuss this issue. (Panama had a similar meeting in the Canal Zone in
                            March of 1973.) He urged Banzer to begin to mobilize international
                            support for that effort.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> read to me a communique
                            which he planned to issue in Israel, and I recommended a number of
                            changes, particularly in areas which I knew would cause great concern
                            among American Jews (e.g., the Palestinian issue). He accepted my
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>It became clearer to me the difficulties he was having in the non-aligned
                            movement and with Libya as a result of this trip. Even <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> had said to his negotiators that
                            he had significant reservations about his trip to Israel. I reassured
                            him that other countries would “understand” the importance of such a
                            trip. We spoke about his trip to Israel and to Europe and he asked
                            whether it would be useful for him to try to encourage the leaders to
                            send telegrams to the Senate on the Canal <pb n="295" facs="0330"
                                xml:id="pg_295"/>Treaties. I said that I thought it would be more
                            useful if the letters were sent to the President, and we publicized them
                            from the White House. The last thing we wanted to do was to make the
                            Senate feel as if we were trying to mobilize international public
                            opinion to pressure them. He raised this issue again at breakfast with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton Jordan</persName>, and got the
                            same response.</p>
                        <p>I was surprised to hear him voice repeated concern about being out of the
                            country so long. He made the following joke twice: “When I return to

                            come home for a vacation.”</p>

                            that. At the moment, if the President invited Garcia Marquez or others
                            to a reception, they would have to refuse, but if these writers sent a

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was extremely secretive
                            about conveying this message, but said that he thought that it was an
                            extremely good and important idea. He asked me my opinion. I said that I
                            didn’t think the time was right for such a meeting. I thought that the
                            President would not be well served to extend himself to the Latin
                            American Left at a time when he was going to have such great problems
                            with the North American Right over the Canal Treaties. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was inclined to agree with
                                <pb n="296" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_296"/>me but asked if he should
                            raise it with <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton Jordan</persName>
                            during a breakfast the next day. I said that his raising of the issue
                            with <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> would not present me
                            with any problems.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">8.</hi> The Treaties</p>
                        <p>Naturally we spent a large part of the time talking about the chances for
                            Senate ratification. All of the Panamanians were very much bothered by
                            their meetings with Panamanian students, who had called them “traitors”
                            and “bad Panamanians.” They were clearly having a rougher time than they
                            had expected. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, himself,
                            was forced to wait for four hours in a hotel room for student leaders to
                            meet with him. (He told that story twice.)</p>
                        <p>In speaking about the status-of-forces agreement, he said that he had
                            developed a “special formula for the School of the Americas” but he did
                            not elaborate. He asked me to talk to him privately about this later,
                            but the opportunity did not arise.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to him that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> position
                            on reservations, amendments, or even understandings, would be to oppose
                            all of them to the very end. But I noted that we may have to consider
                            them if the ratification depended on a few votes which could be swung by
                            our accepting such a reservation. I said that we would certainly
                            maintain very close liaison with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> throughout the ratification process, and if it
                            appeared that we needed this reservation, we would discuss it at some
                            length before taking a public position.</p>
                        <p>He joked about a telegram he had sent to the Governor of South Carolina
                            (“home of Strom”) when he flew over his State. He said that he hoped
                            that the understanding necessary to build such an important dam could be
                            used to help South Carolina better understand Panama’s case.</p>

                            that he thought that the trip would be an excellent one, but he wanted
                            to think about the question a bit longer and said that he would send me

                            said that the military dictators in Latin America (and it was very clear

                            President. He said that it would be a good lesson for these Generals in
                            Latin America to see the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> General
                            taking orders from the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            President.</p>
                        <p>In other discussions about Latin American countries, he showed his
                            extreme displeasure for <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName>’s
                            right-wing dictatorship in Nicaragua, not because he disliked <persName

                            he considered it such a feudal country. In talking about Argentina, he
                            basically supported President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1"
                                >Perez</persName>’s line of argument and said that Videla needed our
                            support. He talked about the rivalry between the Army and Navy and had a
                            very good sense of the politics of that country. He also promised me an
                            aide memoire on Argentina.</p>

                            to win the battle for the minds of the next generation of Latin

                            the Soviet Union has done—to find many young, talented but poor Latin
                            Americans and give them complete scholarships to <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> universities. He said that he thought we were losing
                            to the Russians in this effort, and he hoped that we would increase our
                            efforts to educate the poor and talented. I said that I had thought we
                            were indeed financing many more scholarships for students of the

                            capabilities. He said to me at one point that he would have liked to
                            have been a humorist but “the design of my face is bad.” “I am actually
                            smiling all the time,” he said, “but you can’t tell that by looking at

                        <p>He was extremely nice to me, repeating several times that he wished I
                            would come back to Panama to work with him and that he wished he could
                            have a son like me. A very warm and candid person who is at the same
                            time capable of being very profound, although in a very simple and

                            has the simple raw intelligence and common sense of a leader.</p>

                            about this because of Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"

                            the treaty. I tried to distinguish for him the difference in a
                            “reservation” and an “understanding” so that these terms would be
                            familiar to him and so that they would not overreact politically to

                            over, they will have acted officially on the treaty initialed by the two

                                >Torrijos</persName> in the position of having to go back to his
                            people for their additional approval if a “reservation” is added or
                            agreed to by the Senate the first of the year. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said it will even be
                            difficult to refrain from responding <pb n="299" facs="0334"
                                xml:id="pg_299"/>officially to an “understanding” if that
                            “understanding” states in very explicit terms things that were only
                            implied in the treaty already signed.</p>
                        <p>At any rate, we need to be continually mindful of the political pressures
                            under which <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> governs. He
                            obviously has a great deal more flexibility than we do, but we should
                            also understand that there are limits to what he can do.</p>
                        <p>For the time being, I would strongly recommend the following in terms of
                            our own strategy:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">That we are opposed to all reservations</hi>. That
                            we believe strongly in the treaty that has been negotiated and signed by
                            the two countries. To suggest that we would even consider a
                            “reservation” at this point suggests that we are ready and willing to
                            make early political concessions. It should also be explained that the
                            talk of a “reservation” jeopardizes the possibility of a new treaty as
                            the Panamanians would have to vote twice on the treaty. Put more simply,
                            you might pose the question as to how the Senate would feel if, after
                            passing the treaty, they were asked to vote a second time on a less
                            satisfactory treaty. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has political problems like this underscores
                            the fact that he is <hi rend="italic">not a dictator with total control
                                of his country and unresponsive to public opinion</hi>. At the same
                            time, we must be respectful of the Senate right to add reservations, but
                            you should make clear to them the process by which you would agree to
                            such an act.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">That we are opposed generally to the addition of
                                numerous “understandings” and would only look favorably on those
                                that were necessary to clarify the true meaning of the treaty and
                                the intentions of both countries</hi>. Again, to look favorably on
                            “understandings” suggests a willingness on our part to compromise early
                            and ignores the political realities that face Torrijos. We were only
                            able to get a treaty because our defense rights after the year 2000 were
                            implied and not explicit. If the opponents choose to state those rights
                            explicitly, it will probably pick us up the votes in the Senate that we
                            will need to win ratification. It obviously will create major political
                            problems for Torrijos.</p>
                        <p>I posed the question as to whether General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> might approve personally any “understanding” or
                            even a “reservation” if it did not change substantively the meaning of
                            the treaty and in that way avoid the need for a possible second
                            referendum in Panama. He laughed and said that it was impossible for him
                            to be a “democratic leader” for the first referendum and a “dictator”
                            for the second.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I suspect the General has more political flexibility than he
                            allows at this point, but we should not ignore the political situation
                            he faces in his own country nor assume his willingness and/or ability to
                            go along with any “understanding” or “reservation” the Senate might
                            attach. Therefore, we should be very cautious in our <pb n="300"
                                facs="0335" xml:id="pg_300"/>public comments to discourage the idea
                            of adding “reservations” or “understandings”.</p>
                        <p>My own sense of the thing is that we will probably have to agree to some
                            “understandings” in the final stages to secure enough votes for passage,
                            and that at that point it can be explained to <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> in a manner that he will find
                            satisfactory. The addition of any “reservations” will require him to go
                            back to his people and could be a major obstacle to getting a treaty. We
                            should just keep his political situation in mind as well as our own as
                            we go into the final stretch.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, we should take—for the time being—a hard line in
                            opposition to any “reservations” and discourage <persName

                            and consent to ratification of the treaties. Instead, their strategy is
                            to add amendments and reservations to the treaties nullifying their
                            effect and making them unpalatable to Panama.</p>
                        <p>Last Thursday,<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">September 22.</note> Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Allen</persName> departed from a

                        <p>As you may know, fights over Senate alteration of controversial treaties
                            are typical. We have enclosed a Congressional Quarterly summary of
                            Senate consideration of the Treaty of Versailles.<note n="4"

                            over reservations contributed to defeat of that treaty.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, Senate alterations of the treaties could be of great benefit
                            if Senators can protect their political flanks by supporting an
                            alteration while still voting in favor of the resolution of advise and
                            consent. However, the process is also our Achilles heel if too many
                            unacceptable reservations and amendments are added. We have begun to
                            devise a strategy that will prepare us to tread the line between
                            disaster and a success that is least harmful for treaty supporters.</p>

                            PROCEDURES</p>
                        <p>The substantive difference between understandings, reservations and
                            amendments is a matter of degree. Reservations and amendments normally
                            will add or delete provisions that are relatively important to the
                            framework of a treaty. Understandings usually add nuances that have a
                            less important impact on the treaties.</p>
                        <p>However, the procedural and legal differences that flow from these
                            alternative Senate actions are enormous. If a particular Senate action
                            on the Canal treaties is phrased in terms of an “understanding”, then
                            Panama may issue an ambiguous statement or reject the understanding, and
                            the treaty may still be brought into force. The effort would be to
                            postpone questions of interpretation implicit in the understanding until
                            the issue arises.</p>

                            force without specific Panamanian approval. To make matters worse,
                            Panama’s plebiscite is scheduled for October 23, well before Senate
                            action is likely on the treaties. Consequently, Panama’s constitution
                            may require that reservations adopted by the Senate be approved, if at
                            all, by a second plebiscite.</p>

                            neither support nor oppose them conceptually. The Senate will interpret
                            such a response as indicating flexibility. Of course, when Senators

                            Consequently, the State Department should secretly draft acceptable
                            language for compromise reservations and begin secret negotiations with
                            Panama for their approval. If this can be done before the plebiscite, it
                            may be possible for the Panamanians to construct their text of the
                            treaties in such a manner as to avoid a second plebiscite if the Senate

                            Ratification of the treaties may well hinge on our ability to deal with
                            this problem, and we have begun working with the Panamanians to solve
                            it. Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> also asked
                            that the committee have access to all negotiating records and other
                            documents which might be pertinent to resolving these issues. On the

                            in which the Executive Branch has released to the Senate the full and
                            confidential record of treaty negotiations or the record of its internal
                            deliberations. There are cases, beginning with the Jay Treaty in 1796,
                            in which the President has refused such requests. Over the years,

                            and briefings, but have resorted to the exercise of executive privilege

                            Moreover, an early exchange would be subject to the risk that new
                            questions of interpretation may arise as Senate consideration of the
                            treaties proceeds, and it might not be possible to have a further

                        </p>
                        <p>Under the new Treaties, and particularly the neutrality Treaty, Panama
                            and the United States have the responsibility to assure that the Panama
                            Canal will always remain open, secure and accessible to ships of all
                            nations. Accordingly, Panama and the United States each will have the
                            right to take any appropriate measures to defend the Canal against any
                            threat to the regime of neutrality established in the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Treaty does not give the United States any right to intervene in the
                            internal affairs of Panama, nor has it been our intention to seek or to
                            exercise such a right.</p>
                        <p>We firmly believe that the Treaty arrangements amply protect the Panama
                            Canal as an international waterway, serve the interests of both
                            countries, and form the basis of a new partnership based on mutual
                            respect between Panama and the United States.</p>

                        <p>We are, of course, in continuing contact with the Panamanian Government
                            to clarify any points of interpretation regarding the Treaties which may
                            arise in either country.</p>

                            feasibility of a sea-level canal in Panama. The costs and legislative
                            requirements for such a study to be conducted now by the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Army Corps of Engineers are discussed
                            below. This proposal would be perhaps one way to carry out that
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>As you consider it, the proposal should be viewed in the larger context
                            of (a) the impact of the proposal upon obtaining Senate consent on the
                            Treaties and (b) how the proposal would be received in Panama. For
                            example,</p>
                        <p>Would proposing legislation for the study, while ratification is pending,
                            assist or retard progress toward Senate acceptance of the Treaties?
                            Should the proposal be held up until after ratification?</p>

                        <p>Does this study proposal meet the commitment for a joint study? What

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>The Corps of Engineers—acting as agent for the Atlantic-Pacific
                            Interoceanic Canal Study Commission—completed a study of a sea-level
                            canal in 1970.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">See <ref target="#d76fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, Document 76.</ref>
                            </note> The sea-level canal would have been located in the Republic of
                            Panama with an estimated construction cost of $2.9 billion at 1970
                            prices. The Commission, chaired by former Treasury Secretary Robert
                            Anderson—concluded at that time that the construction of the canal
                            should be initiated 15 years before the existing canal reached its
                            capacity—then estimated to be around the end of this century.</p>
                        <p>The inability of the current canal to accommodate large tankers to
                            transport Alaskan oil directly to the east coast has led to proposals
                            for a reexamination of the feasibility of a sea-level canal by the Corps
                            of Engineers. The Corps estimates that such a canal would cost about
                            $6.2 billion at today’s prices. The Corps could prepare an updated
                            three-year study of the canal at a cost of $7 million, including a full
                            estimate of the environmental impacts. Of this, $2 million would be
                            needed for on-site investigations in Panama which would, of course,
                            require the agreement of the Government of Panama.</p>
                        <p>Authorizing legislation would be needed if the Corps were to undertake
                            this assignment. We would then ask the Corps to <hi rend="italic"
                                >reprogram</hi> sufficient funds to initiate the study, with
                            first-year costs estimated at $1.5 million. We understand you will be
                            asked by Senator Gravel to seek specific appropriation for these costs.
                            We do not believe that such appropriations are necessary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments for a restudy</p>
                        <p>—$7 million is a relatively small price to pay for an informed assessment
                            of the current engineering, economic and environmental feasibility of a
                            sea-level canal.</p>
                        <p>—A study is not a commitment to construct, so no irrevocable decision
                            regarding a sea-level canal is involved.</p>
                        <p>—If current changes in the economics of energy transportation continue,
                            construction of a sea-level canal could prove to be in the <pb n="311"
                                facs="0346" xml:id="pg_311"/>national interest and the availability
                            of a current feasibility study would then be highly desirable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments against a restudy</p>
                        <p>—Administration support for a sea-level canal study by the Corps—even
                            though not a commitment to construct—will be strongly resisted by
                            environmentalists who are concerned about potential adverse
                            environmental and ecological effects from mixing waters from the Pacific
                            and Atlantic Oceans, e.g., introduction of poisonous Pacific sea snakes
                            into the Atlantic. You have received a memorandum from <persName
                                corresp="#p_PF_1">Frank Press</persName> on this topic.<note n="4"

                        </p>
                        <p>—In the short run, it is likely that the existing canal with special
                            arrangements for lightering petroleum to smaller vessels will be
                            satisfactory to meet our needs.</p>
                        <p>—Many transportation economists question whether the costs of a sea-level
                            canal could be recovered from tolls even if the energy transportation
                            problem worsens.</p>

                        <p>I am attaching an initial draft of the Joint Statement<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d109fn3">Not attached.</note> which was given to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> this afternoon. As you will note,
                            we did not add “in time of national emergency” at the end of the “when
                            necessary” clause in the second paragraph. I believe we will have
                            greater flexibility of action without a qualification of this clause. In
                            our view the last two paragraphs of the Joint Statement should only
                            apply to the Treaty after the year 2000, since we will be able to
                            control passage through the Canal until that year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> did not raise the question
                            of a reservation with us. He said that if the Joint Statement is
                            ultimately adopted, the Senate would then have to decide how to take it
                            into account. If we could persuade the Senate to use the Joint Statement
                            as an expression of its understanding (rather than a formal
                            reservation), we would avoid opening up the Treaties to other
                            reservations.</p>

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Panama Canal Treaties Hearings:</hi> The Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee today took testimony on the Canal Treaties
                            from retired Admirals Moorer and Zumwalt and from retired General
                            Maxwell Taylor. Moorer opposes the treaties, the other two are in
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>In Moorer’s view, already expressed to the House International Affairs
                                Committee,<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">See <ref target="#d83fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 83.</ref>
                            </note> we must be present in the Canal to insure our access to it. The
                            proposed treaties provide for our withdrawal in 22 years, a time that
                            “is just around the corner” in the Admiral’s view. <pb n="313"
                                facs="0348" xml:id="pg_313"/>Moorer sees a Moscow-Havana-Panama
                            axis, a view which led Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1"
                                >Baker</persName> to request the Committee to require the State
                            Department to provide an analysis of the possible relationship between
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Panama should the
                            treaties be ratified. In questioning Moorer, Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJH_1">Glenn</persName> called upon the State Department
                            to respond as quickly as possible to the Committee’s letter concerning
                            the provisions of “expeditious passage” and “intervention” in the
                            treaties. Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> had a
                            further request of the State Department: that it provide a list of
                            visits by <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> to Cuba as
                            compared with his visits to democratic Latin Republics, say
                            Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>Zumwalt said the Canal was important to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> security. Access to it would be better insured with the
                            treaties than without them. He would like to see a clarification by both
                            governments of the matter about which there now seems to be divergent
                            interpretation, especially “expeditious passage” and Article IV of the
                            Neutrality Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The treaties would be in danger, <persName corresp="#p_TTE1_"
                                >Taylor</persName> thinks, if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            sought to obtain Panama’s agreement to greater precision in the
                            provisions upon which there is seeming differences of interpretation.
                            The generalities are purposeful, and provide for freedom of action. To
                            seek Panama’s agreement to a specific provision for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> “intervention” would be absurd, in
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTE1_">Taylor</persName>’s view.</p>
                        <p>After the Admirals and the General testified, the Committee heard the
                            testimony of four American residents of the Canal Zone in their capacity
                            as leaders of civic councils. They oppose the treaties.</p>

                            rather significant disagreements remained:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The line which separates the concept of “defending
                                the Canal’s neutrality” and “intervening in Panama” is a fuzzy one,
                                and the Panamanians see it quite differently than we do</hi>. If the
                            question were asked, “Can the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> land
                            and station 50,000 <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> soldiers near
                            the Canal in case of an impending threat?”, we, of course, would say,
                            “yes.” The Panamanians would say, “no.”</p>

                        <p>Without probing the Panamanian position very hard, it seemed that the
                            Panamanians believe we can only defend the Canal’s neutrality either by
                            sea (on the Atlantic or Pacific sides of the Canal), by our Air Force
                            (“the Pentagon umbrella”), or by a lightning strike into the Canal area,
                            with a prompt departure after the crisis ends. They clearly do not
                            contemplate the possibility of us keeping only troops there,
                            particularly if there is no obvious international threat to the Canal.
                            (They would probably deny the possibility that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> can defend it from a Panamanian
                            threat.) I suspect that most Americans interpret the neutrality treaty
                            very differently.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Who interprets when the neutrality of the Canal is
                                threatened?</hi> While the Panamanians have accepted the principle
                            that each country—the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and
                            Panama—can <hi rend="italic">act</hi> when the Canal is threatened,
                            there has not yet been agreement on the question, “Can each country
                            interpret when the Canal is threatened?” A similar question relates to
                            the provisions on “expeditious passage:” who interprets when it is
                            necessary to transit the Canal more quickly than other nations’ ships? I
                            suspect that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and Panamanian
                            negotiators would answer those questions differently.</p>
                        <p>These two sets of questions have not yet been asked and we can hope that
                            they remain undiscovered. But the more we wrestle with this treaty
                            debate, the more I become convinced that the opponents of the treaty
                            will not stop until they have exploited every possible weakness or
                            vagueness in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>You have three possible options as they relate to your upcoming meeting

                            enunciated in the Joint Statement. It is quite possible that these two
                            new issues will never become known, and there is little sense in causing
                            additional problems when we haven’t resolved the three most important
                            ones.</p>

                            try to get an agreed interpretation. Then, you have an option of making
                            this part of the Joint Statement or just getting agreement not to answer
                            publicly those two sets of questions in ways which will permit the
                            opponents of the treaty to exploit them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Option III</hi>—Or you can <hi rend="italic">raise the
                                general issue of possible future misinterpretations</hi>. Having
                            learned that in the era of mass communications, we are all now dealing
                            with a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> audience, we can no longer try to
                            sell a different product to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            than to the Panamanian audience. On new or potentially controversial
                            questions, both sides should agree to consult and reconcile differences
                            before making their answers public.</p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="0351" xml:id="pg_316"/>
                        <p>It seems to me that these questions are likely to be discovered, and it
                            would be extremely harmful to the Administration’s position to have to
                            continually try to reconcile different answers by Panamanian and <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> negotiators to the same questions. If
                            anything, we want to get in front of this problem rather than constantly
                            react and try to reconcile. I would therefore recommend Options II or
                            III—either face the issues in private with <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> or maybe even set up an informal consultative
                            mechanism for anticipating and reconciling potentially divergent
                            responses.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is very concerned about
                            the political problems which have emerged in Panama while he has been
                            travelling through Europe during the past three weeks. He doesn’t doubt
                            that the treaties will be ratified in the plebiscite in <hi
                                rend="italic">10 days</hi>,<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">October
                                23.</note> but he is bothered by the increasing criticism being
                            directed at the treaties <hi rend="italic">and himself</hi>. He is
                            particularly worried about how his meeting with you to “clarify”
                            treaties so recently signed will be interpreted in Panama. We believe
                            that you will find him very reluctant to do anything until he has had a
                            chance to return to Panama and evaluate the situation there. We believe
                            getting a commitment from him as to language is possible, but believe
                            that he will want to wait until he gets back to Panama to make any
                            public statement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">One obvious fact is that the Panamanians have a very
                                limited and superficial understanding of the way our government
                                functions and of the ratification process</hi>. They see the
                            President as the most powerful person in the world and have difficulty
                            comprehending why you are having problems getting the Senate to ratify
                            this treaty.</p>
                        <p>In explaining the need for a clarifying statement of some kind, we noted
                            that in the process of trying to sell a single product to two markets,
                            both sides had made statements which antagonized the buyers in the
                            other’s market. In the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>, several
                            Senators who had supported the treaties, now tell us they won’t vote for
                            it unless several provisions are clarified. If we don’t recapture these
                            Senators and the momentum now, before the Panamanian plebiscite, we will
                            lose the treaties.</p>
                        <p>We told them that key Senators had worked with us in developing some
                            language which tried to deal with the political objections raised in
                            both countries. To the extent that we used this same language to clarify
                            these differences, we would be winning votes in the Senate for the
                            treaties. If we changed or modified this language, we would risk losing
                            their support.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> never explicitly said
                            that he accepted the language. Panamanian negotiator <persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> made clear that he had
                            problems with the third provision—closure due to
                            unprofitability—primarily because he felt that it had been considered in
                            the negotiations and subsequently dropped. Since it wasn’t in the
                            treaty, he argued that we couldn’t very well have a clarifying statement
                            on it. While noting that the neutrality treaty incorporated the concept
                            of an “open” Canal, we said that we didn’t want to engage in a
                            “legalistic” argument over what is essentially a political issue.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> had told us before
                            that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had made this same
                            argument a number of times.)</p>
                        <p>Both sides raised hypothetical questions about the meaning of the
                            treaties, and agreed that if we answered such questions differently, we
                                <pb n="318" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_318"/>would just invite future
                            problems which could make ratification of the treaties impossible.</p>

                                >Torrijos</persName> and I have had a very good conversation. He
                            described his trip to the Middle East and Europe and the widespread
                            approval which the new Panama Canal Treaties have received. The leaders
                            whom he met have deep understanding of the embarrassment to Panama of
                            the existing treaty arrangements. I agree with that assessment as did my
                            three predecessors as President and the Secretaries of Defense and of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>But we have a problem. Although there was a good reaction to the signing
                            ceremony and to visits by Latin American leaders, there is still a very
                            strong opposition in our two countries to the treaties themselves. For
                            example, our mail in the White House is running approximately ten-to-one
                            against the treaty. The opposition is very well organized, but even
                            polls by a private organization I often use show that only 30–35 percent
                            of the American people favor the treaties, while as much as 65–70
                            percent oppose them. It is true that most leaders approve of the
                            treaties, but the general public does not. I am determined to do
                            whatever I can to secure ratification of these treaties, but I recognize
                            the difficulties for a Senator to vote against the will of such a large
                            proportion of his constituents.</p>
                        <p>We estimate that there are about 55 Senators who will vote for
                            ratification at this time; about 20 are opposed, and the others are
                            still in doubt. Some who had promised to favor the treaties now have
                            great doubts because of two very serious points, and because some of the
                            statements that have been made in Panama by <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName> have caused problems here at home.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>I don’t believe there are actually differences between the United States
                            and Panamanian positions, but I recognize that important questions have
                            been raised on two crucial points: the defense of the Canal and the
                            related question of intervention, and the rights of expeditious
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>On the first item, there are two related problems. We ourselves have been
                            embarrassed by <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> intervention in
                            Vietnam, and it is very important that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and I both state clearly that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> has no desire to intervene in
                            Panama’s internal affairs. But we must have clarification with regard to
                            the duties and rights which the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> has
                            to guarantee that the Canal will remain open and neutral for all ships
                            after the year 2000. General Torrijos’ statement at the signing <pb

                            that there was no difference between our two countries on this point,
                            but doubt still remains, and this doubt must be removed.</p>
                        <p>On the question of interpreting the right of expeditious passage, we must
                            clarify this point so that, when necessary, <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and Panamanian ships should be able to go through the
                            Canal without delay even if it means that we go to the head of the line.
                            I believe it is necessary to clarify this point.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and I agreed in
                            our conversation that there is no difference between us on either of
                            these two points, and the Panamanian and the American people would
                            respond well to a declaration along these lines if it were issued
                            today.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> told me,
                            however, it would not be good for him to sign an agreement. But he has
                            no objection to a joint oral statement by myself and by him on these two
                            points. I told him that we could not secure ratification unless there is
                            eventually a written understanding along these lines, but I would remain
                            opposed to any change in the language of the treaty or any addition to
                            the treaty. However, it may be that in spite of my opposition to such
                            changes, that the Senate might still add their interpretation at the
                            time of ratification. But the language which the Senate uses will be the
                            same as what we use in our oral statement.</p>

                                that I didn’t know whether the President knew who <persName

                        <p>The truth is that the statements that I have made here as well as those

                                >Linowitz</persName> and others have caused problems for you in
                            Panama, just as statements by you have caused problems here in the

                            correctly. I have talked for a long time, but feel free to correct me if
                            I have misinterpreted anything in our conversation. Although the debate
                            which is going on is quite serious, I believe that the outside world
                            should see clearly the friendship between the two of us and between our
                            two countries.</p>

                            consumption only. I informed President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> that it would be political suicide for me to sign
                            something before October 23. But we should maintain a great reserve
                            capacity to be able to respond to unforeseen developments in the debate
                            in our two countries. I believe that we can make a joint declaration on
                            the two points that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> mentioned. First, that the <gloss

                            to disrupt the peaceful transit through the Canal. I believe that there
                            is an understanding on our part on this issue. Secondly, that our
                            warships should be able to transit quickly if they need to.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo Escobar
                                Betancourt</persName>:</hi> I believe that both of your statements
                            are correct. There is no difference in interpretation on the rights of
                            the United States in the Neutrality Treaty. The only problem that we
                            have at this time is that of timing and also the way that our
                            understanding is handled.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Senate is not intending to
                            ratify the treaty at this time, but our plebiscite is quite near.
                            Therefore, if we could in Panama place greater emphasis within the same
                            interpretation on those provisions which are most favorable to us before
                            the plebiscite ten days from today, then the two sides can place greater
                            emphasis on the other provisions after the October 23 plebiscite. In
                            other words, if we could reemphasize that provision of the understanding
                            which refers to your intention not to intervene in the internal affairs
                            of Panama, we would be the beneficiaries of much greater support in the
                            ratification in Panama. Then, after the twenty-third, it will be much
                            easier for General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> to
                            lend greater support to you.</p>
                        <p>However, if we both emphasize all the points now, we would not benefit
                            from that. Though both General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> can refer to this overall understanding at this
                            time, we would appreciate it if you place greater emphasis on the
                            non-intervention provision now. And after the twenty-third, we would be
                            able to help you much more.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName>:</hi> It is important for our people and for
                            the Senate especially to know that the Panamanian people will vote on
                            October 23 for treaties which are understood in the same way by the
                            people of the United States as they are by the people of Panama. It is
                            also better to get 70 percent of the vote in Panama in favor of the
                            treaties and get ratification in the United States, than to get 90
                            percent in favor of the treaties in Panama and not obtain ratification
                            in the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> So there must be some
                            balancing of the explanation at the same time in both countries.</p>
                        <p>Let me just outline the approach that we might take, and I would like
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> to
                            comment.</p>
                        <pb n="322" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_322"/>
                        <p>First, we should agree to the exact language of our understanding, but it
                            will not be necessary to publicize that understanding today.</p>
                        <p>Then, we must give the most careful attention by myself and the people in
                            my Administration and you, your negotiators, and the people in your
                            government not to say anything which will in any way contradict the
                            meaning of the understanding or contradict each other.</p>
                        <p>Then, we can announce that I will be writing to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> using exactly the language
                            which we have agreed to today.</p>
                        <p>Then General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, if he
                            chooses, at whatever time he finds convenient, could announce that he
                            has received a letter from me, and that he has no disagreement with the
                            contents of that letter.</p>
                        <p>Later, General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would
                            respond to my letter in writing, confirming the exact text of the
                            understanding. At that point, it could be made public. This exchange of
                            letters could be completed after October 23. But it would be clear
                            before the plebiscite that there is no disagreement between the two of
                            us as to the meaning of the treaties. And the more that you could make
                            public about these letters, the better in my opinion it would be. But
                            that is your judgment. It would help also if you or <persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> could say publicly that each
                            country has the right to defend the Canal and the right of peaceful
                            transit by all the world’s commerce, that the United States rejects the
                            right to intervene, and that we both agree on the right to defend the
                            Canal beyond the life of the basic treaty.</p>
                        <p>I saw Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName> shaking
                            his head, and I would like him to comment and to be as frank as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>

                                    Linowitz</persName>:</hi> My concern is that the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee wants to be certain that the people of Panama and
                            the people of the United States have the same understanding of the
                            treaties. One way to obviate that concern is a clear statement by both
                            countries at this time.</p>

                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said it is impossible for him
                            to sign such a statement before the twenty-third, and I respect

                            is room for compromise. Suppose that you and General <persName

                            you had agreed on many of these provisions which President <persName

                                >Torrijos</persName> would make a statement when he returned to
                            Panama that the Treaty on Neutrality does not signify, nor should it be
                            interpreted, as a right of intervention by the United States in the
                            internal affairs of Panama. It should, however, be interpreted as the
                            right of the United States to <pb n="323" facs="0358" xml:id="pg_323"
                            />take action against a threat to destroy the Canal or to impede passage
                            through the Canal. On the question of expeditious passage, he would say
                            that both countries’ ships would have the right to rapidly transit
                            without any barriers or impediments, and in case of need or emergency,
                            such ships could go to the head of the line.</p>

                                    >Linowitz</persName>:</hi> One reason that we are able to
                            complete the negotiations so quickly, Mr. President, was because
                                <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo</persName> (<persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>) was so creative in coming up
                            with compromise solutions. He was always searching for ways to find
                            common ground between the two sides. I think we’re close to agreement on
                            the second point. On the first point in the statement, we dealt with the
                            right of the United States to take action to defend the Canal’s
                            neutrality, and then said that we don’t want to interfere in the
                            internal affairs. We used the same language, but the order that we use
                            is reversed.</p>

                        <p>Although it has not been translated into positive votes or commitments, I
                            feel that we have regained some of the political momentum on the treaty
                            that was lost over the past couple of months. I attribute that to
                            several factors:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Clarifying statement</hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d106fn8">footnote 8, Document 106</ref>.</note>
                            This undercut the arguments that had become the focus of the Birchers
                            and the right-wingers. We were on the defensive for several weeks, but
                            this statement turned things around.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Novelty of the organized mail campaign has begun to
                                wear out</hi>. This is not meant to suggest that the mail has not
                            had a tremendous impact on the Hill. It has, but the Senators have
                            recognized it for what it is. <pb n="325" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_325"
                            />They are over the initial shock of receiving large number of letters
                            against the treaty.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Some shift in public opinion polls</hi>. Although it
                            seems to have stalled at around 30–35%, the Senators no longer have to
                            deal with polls that show the opposition 10 to 1.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Some significant breakthroughs in the South</hi>. We
                            now have public commitments from <persName corresp="#p_HEF_1"
                                >Hollings</persName> of South Carolina and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRB_1">Morgan</persName> of North Carolina. This has
                            created a better atmosphere in the Senate for other Southern Senators to
                            consider supporting the treaty.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Good state briefings</hi>. The extensive briefings
                            have created a better atmosphere among opinion leaders and political
                            figures in each state.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Generally, good editorial support and favorable
                                press</hi>. The newspaper support for the treaty has been decisive.
                            Also, the specials on the treaty (Bill Moyers, public service specials,
                            etc.) have been very positive and helpful.</p>
                        <p>Still, we face a tough fight to win on ratification.</p>

                        <p>It was my thinking that we would continue our present posture until after

                            likely to continue late until the year, I believe that we have to begin
                            to shift gears now in terms of our efforts to educate the American
                            people. If we wait until after Christmas, we have a conflict with your

                        <p>For that reason, I would suggest that we begin now to think and plan

                                >Linowitz</persName> noted that the Statement made it clear that
                            both countries had intended the same meaning in the Neutrality Treaty,
                            and that, for this reason, no additional formality should be necessary.
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_JJK_1">Javits</persName> said that he
                            understood why there would be an objection to a reservation, as this
                            could modify the treaty or reopen negotiations, but felt there should be
                            no adverse consequences in the Senate’s approving the treaty with an
                            understanding identical to the October 14 Statement. Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> said that he would prepare an
                            Understanding for consideration by the Committee.</p>

                        <p>During the drive, <persName corresp="#p_GRR_1">Gonzalez</persName> told

                            government. Cerro Colorado is an area in the North of Panama which will
                            likely become the third largest copper mine in the world (behind
                            Terriente in Chile, and Zambia’s). It will be developed in cooperation
                            with Texasgulf (which will have 20 percent of the equity), will cost
                            about $1.0 billion, take about three years to build (expected to begin
                            in 1979), and by 1982, earn about $400 million annually. In short, the
                            Canal as a Panamanian resource will be dwarfed by Cerro Colorado.</p>

                            asked me to meet with him privately in his bedroom, which looks as if it
                            was furnished by Playboy International. Sprawed across an enormous
                            imperial bed, he told me that his trip was an extremely interesting and
                            educational experience, that all the leaders had offered their complete
                            support for the treaties, and that he wrote summaries of his
                            conversations <hi rend="italic">only for President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s use</hi> (he asked me not
                            to share these pages with the State Department or even with his
                            Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis</persName>), and
                            he had organized his notes in three parts:</p>
                        <p>1. A summary of the conversations.</p>
                        <p>2. A summary of the foreign leaders’ evaluation of President <persName

                        <p>3. A personal impression and evaluation of the foreign leader.</p>
                        <p>It was quite obvious that he had devoted a good deal of time to these
                            notes, and he had done that primarily to share his experiences with his
                            friend, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>. He said
                            that he had a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation with Helmut
                            Schmidt, but that of all the leaders he has ever met, he felt the
                            closest to Carter. (He also repeatedly said that he looked at <persName
                                corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton Jordan</persName> and me as “the sons he
                            wished he had.” He also thanked me sincerely and warmly for coming.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that he had
                            returned to Panama to find his negotiators debating the Canal Treaty
                            with lawyers and professors at a level which ordinary Panamanians could
                            not understand. “Neutrality, expeditious passage, transit rights—these
                            words do not mean anything to poor Panamanians,” he said. “The debate
                            had moved to references of Plato and Roman law, but all the Panamanian
                            people cared about was when <pb n="329" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_329"

                            which <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> then addressed.
                            He visited many areas, found strong support for the treaties, and had
                            taped one hour of a “town meeting” to be shown on Thursday night,
                            October 20, at 7:30 p.m. He expected that the debate on television,
                            which had begun with the signing, would be completed with his
                            remarks.</p>
                        <p>He had had a good interview with Bill Moyers, who is producing a
                            60-minute documentary, which will be shown around November 1. He also
                            met with Carl Midgail of <hi rend="italic">

                            thought that the idea of holding plebiscites on national issues seemed a

                            filled with some very fascinating correspondence between Wayne,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TJ_2"
                                >John Tower</persName>, and other conservatives.</p>
                        <p>Wayne had written a long letter to <persName corresp="#p_RR_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> listing all the political debts <persName
                                corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> owed him and asked him to
                            reconsider his position on the Canal and to speak with McGowan, who
                            received a phone call from <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName>
                            at 7:00 a.m. two days after Wayne sent the letter. McGowan found
                                <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> “soft” on the issue
                            and open to his arguments. While <persName corresp="#p_RR_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> was not immediately converted, he asked McGowan
                            to return in a week for more discussion. McGowan does not think a
                                <persName corresp="#p_RR_1">Reagan</persName> conversion is
                            impossible, though he recognized it was improbable. He did think it
                            probable that he could neutralize <persName corresp="#p_RR_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> as the leader of the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Other letters show that Wayne’s influence over <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ_2">Tower</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GB_1"
                                >Goldwater</persName> is quite considerable. The letter from
                                <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>, for example, was
                            clearly from a close friend who valued Wayne’s opinion and was prepared
                            to support the treaty on the basis of his advice.<note n="11"

                        <p>After Nicaragua’s attack on several Costa Rican border towns and ships,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that he had
                            offered to Oduber his elite battalion of the Guard (which has been
                            stationed as part of the United Nations Force in the Sinai) as a symbol
                            of his solidarity with Costa Rica against Nicaragua. He thinks that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName>’s regime is morally
                            bankrupt, and predicts it won’t last two years more. As far as the
                            Sandinistas, he knew many of its leaders, and had offered jobs in Panama
                            for several. He said the Sandinistas enjoyed broad support in Nicaragua,
                            and the source of the support was simply hatred of <persName

                        <p>On Thursday morning (October 20), he asked me to accompany him when he
                            gave a speech before a convention of Panamanian professionals (lawyers,
                            doctors, architects, academics) in the National Congress. His speech,
                            which was extemporaneous, was well received.</p>
                        <p>Of special interest was the trip there. We travelled in <persName
                                corresp="#p_GRR_1">Roary Gonzalez</persName>’s car with no security
                            whatsoever, stopping for all of Panama City’s traffic lights.
                            Occasionally, people would recognize him when we stopped for a red
                            light, and would come over to talk to him, calling him “<persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Omar</persName>” and either saying nice words
                            about the treaty, asking for some help for their community, or special
                            pleading (“My husband is in jail; could you pardon him?”) He was very
                            solicitous. The women came up and kissed him.</p>
                        <p>After his speech, he took me to the ghettos near the Zone and told me
                            that he wanted me to see the bad as well as the good part of Panama. (I
                            was already familiar with the areas because of my previous trip to
                            Panama.) He said that he was gradually clearing this area and building
                            low-income housing, but that his attention had been devoted to the Canal
                            Treaties. He told me and the people on the street that his next task
                            after the Treaties would be to help the poor. He asked them about their
                            problems and talked with them at some length. Again, the total absence
                            of police protection, particularly in such a poor area, surprised me.
                            (In fact, his home in Panama has only the most minimal security.) He
                            asked the poor people how they would vote on the plebi<pb n="332"
                                facs="0367" xml:id="pg_332"/>scite, and rather spontaneously, they
                            all said they would support it. The brief meeting was totally
                            spontaneous, and I could tell by the character of the complaints and the
                            way the people talked that they view him as a friend. They were not
                            exactly deferential in the way they talked with their Head of State.
                            They talked with him as they would with almost any other Panamanian.</p>

                            his conversations. Rather detailed notes had been kept of his meetings,
                            but he decided to discard them in favor of short summaries dictated in
                            his inimical style and organized in three parts: (1) a summary of the
                            conversation; (2) a short note of the foreign leader’s evaluation of you
                            (all are favorable; most stress your moral and ethical qualities); and
                            (3) Torrijos’ personal evaluation of these leaders.</p>

                            concluded visit of Senator <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Robert
                                Byrd</persName> and his six senatorial colleagues to Panama.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Quote I observed a high degree of morality in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Senators in their investigations
                            related to the treaties and I am certain that they acted in good faith.
                            I feel that the Senators recognized that one who is not convinced of the
                            rightousness or justice of a cause can hardly convince others. This trip
                            served the purpose of providing the visiting Senators with knowledge and
                            information on situations that will require some time to be fully
                            understood. I saw in them open minds and a willingness to change their
                            concepts once they established contact with a reality that previously
                            had been unknown to them.</p>
                        <p>3. I think Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> and the
                            Senators who accompanied him all gave a clear demonstration of the moral
                            attitude of the American people. At times I feared that because of the
                            liveliness and enthusiasm surrounding the visit and the conversations,
                            the visiting Senators might come to think that there was a prefabricated
                            scenario. There was not, and I believe they realized that.</p>
                        <p>4. The Senators had an unusual opportunity to establish contact with the
                            whole political spectrum in Panama. They talked with the sweet and the
                            sour, and even with the H2O, i.e., with those of the <pb n="337"
                                facs="0372" xml:id="pg_337"/>extreme Right, the extreme Left and
                            even with the colorless and tasteless.</p>
                        <p>5. I noticed that the Senators’ visit and their contact with the country
                            made them realize the urgent need for prompt ratification of the
                            treaties. It is one thing to be a colonizer and another to be
                            colonized.</p>
                        <p>6. The interest shown by the visiting Senators and their knowledge of the
                            situation as presented gained them my deep appreciation. They were not
                            like some <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> politicians who think in
                            terms of living off the Panama problem without caring about the
                            consequences which a delay in ratification may bring to the Panamanian
                            people.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, I explained to the visiting Senators that in spite of the
                            fact that we have been exposed to Communists, anarchists, imperialists,
                            and the many cultures that pass through our country, our people are
                            mature enough to choose the path best suited to our nation. I
                            appreciated the feeling of pride in the attitude of these Senators who,
                            through the ratification issue, wish to place their constituencies in
                            the forefront of imaginative and constructive political development.</p>

                        <p>I received a call today from Panama from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis</persName> who asked if he could
                            come and see me as soon as possible. I replied that he could and thought
                            nothing of it as we stay in touch constantly on matters related to
                            ratification of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I asked him how he was doing and he responded that, “things are going
                            badly here—that is why I must talk to you as soon as possible.”</p>
                        <p>This was a curious remark so I inquired of <persName corresp="#p_PRA_1"
                                >Bob Pastor</persName> as to any recent information on the internal
                            situation in Panama. He provided me with the following information and
                            the attached memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Not
                                attached.</note> From all that I can learn, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has become personally
                            despondent for several reasons.</p>
                        <p>First, the Panamanian economy is in poor shape. Unemployment and
                            inflation are high and foreign investment is off. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> thinks that potential foreign
                            investors are holding off because of uncertainty about treaty
                            ratification and/or rejection and the implications of either action.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the first time, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has permitted criticism of his leadership and
                            the treaty and the groups of people opposed to him <pb n="339"
                                facs="0374" xml:id="pg_339"/>and the treaties are exercising their
                            new rights freely. He has been booed at several rallies and was shaken
                            by it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and probably most importantly, they do not understand our system
                            of government and are confused about the repeated delays in final
                            consideration of the treaties by the Senate. We told them initially that
                            we would work for an October vote on the treaties and have postponed the
                            likely date for a vote several times. All we can say now is that after
                            the energy bill is passed,<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">See <ref

                            Opponents of the Treaties thereby would have additional avenues to

                        </p>
                        <p>We also have an active working Senate staff group headed by Dick McCall
                            in Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>’s office. A
                            number of Senators (e.g., <persName corresp="#p_MRB_1"
                            >Morgan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HEF_1">Hollings</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WLP_1">Weicker</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_1">Matsunaga</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HM_1"
                                >Hatfield</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HS_1"
                                >Hayakawa</persName>) are making speeches in favor of the
                            Treaties.</p>
                        <p>Several factors are also working against us. Senate mail in favor of the
                            Treaties has picked up, but the count is still strongly against. News
                            stories have appeared with vote counts more pessimistic than our own.
                            Senators supporting the Treaties are still not organized into a cohesive
                            working group. Sentiment is growing that the Treaties will have to be
                            substantially altered by the Senate to pass. Since the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> trip, there have been no
                            additional events or news stories to indicate progress toward support
                            for ratification. Finally, it appears that Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> will be unable to play as
                            strong a role during the debates as he would like.</p>
                        <p>At this time, there is little movement in the Senate for or against the
                            Treaties, since energy is the overriding concern. Most Senators feel
                            that this issue is far down the road (i.e., next year) and are not
                            actively involved with Panama. Pressure is increasing from both sides on
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>, since all realize
                            his decision on the Treaties will be crucial.</p>
                        <p>The present equilibrium will be disrupted when the Treaties are about to
                            be reported. Minority members of the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1"
                                >SFRC</gloss>—particularly <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1"
                                >Baker</persName> and Griffin—will be forced to choose sides and
                            justify their positions with fresh arguments, hopefully in favor. The
                            first fights over amendments will occur in the Committee. The attitude
                            of non-<gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> Senators will be heavily
                            influenced by (a) the momentum Senators <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> and
                            others may decide to build before the Committee reports, (b) the force
                            of the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss>’s action and (c)
                            accompanying support from the Administration and public spokesmen.</p>

                        <p>At the leadership breakfast, Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> indicated he wants Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sparkman</persName> to report the Treaties out
                            this year. White House Liaison met with <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> shortly thereafter and raised three problems with
                            that idea:</p>
                        <p>First, an early <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> vote would force
                            an early decision by Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1"
                                >Baker</persName> who is certainly inclined to wait until next year.
                            A strong push could easily result in a no vote. Second, the <gloss
                                target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> plans a trip to Panama in January
                            before marking up the Treaties. Third, the Armed Services Committee has
                            been led to believe the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> will not
                            report the Treaties until after its own January hearings.<note n="6"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Majority Leader indicated he would check all three of these
                            objections before pursuing <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1"
                                >Sparkman</persName> further on an early vote. We believe he will
                            find it impossible to have the Committee mark up the Treaties this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>We can, however, expect that the Committee will act immediately next
                            year. Markup should take no more than five days. Thus, the Treaties
                            could be on the floor during the first week of February. Of course the
                            only real lobbying time we will have prior to this is the remainder of
                            this year prior to completion of energy and the days after January 19
                            when the Senate reconvenes.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to predict the length of the debate. If final passage
                            seems likely, both supporters and opponents may find protracted debate
                            on such a no-win issue unattractive. If the issue is in doubt, opponents
                            who see a chance to embarrass the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> Administration may try to prolong the debate.
                            Three weeks seems a likely minimum, but this could be extended
                            substantially in the likely event that we are faced with a blizzard of
                            amendments. Much will depend on how the leadership chooses to deal with
                            these amendments.</p>

                            The White House will be involved where necessary.</p>
                        <p>A large majority of the Committee and its staff support the Treaties.
                            Senators <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>, Griffin and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Stone</persName> are question marks. Our
                            objective should be unanimous support by the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1"
                                >SFRC</gloss>, because support from <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1"

                                >Stone</persName> would produce decisive momentum on the floor. This
                            will almost certainly require some Committee amendments, <pb n="344"
                                facs="0379" xml:id="pg_344"/>but Committee amendments are probably
                            inevitable in any case. Obviously we will want as few amendments as
                            possible in Committee, consistent with the unanimity objective, thereby
                            reserving acceptable amendment opportunities for picking up votes on the
                                floor.<note n="7" xml:id="d124fn7">An unknown hand highlighted this
                                sentence.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first task will be to get a realistic assessment from the Committee
                            on the number and substance of amendments that it is likely to report
                            with the Treaties. <hi rend="italic">The Administration must continue to
                                oppose all amendments</hi>, which means that negotiating will have
                            to be done by favorable Senators. However, it is possible for us to
                            offer “technical drafting assistance” in selected cases to make
                            amendments less objectionable, as long as it is clearly understood we
                            oppose the amendments even in revised form and will lobby against them.
                            It must be made clear that we absolutely cannot accept any amendments
                            even as reservations or understandings which would require Panama to
                            resubmit the Treaties to a vote by plebiscite. Lobbying against
                            amendments that seriously alter Treaty language should begin as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned above, the Armed Services Committee plans to hold hearings
                            in January. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SJC_1">Stennis</persName> has
                            not decided on the length of the hearings, but his staff is clearly

                        <p>(3) solicit support or pledges of neutrality.</p>

                            This group should work with us and Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> on identifying potential Senate supporters and in

                            during the debate. This group should meet at least twice with White

                        <p>The Senate will take up the Treaties as a Committee of the Whole. The
                            legislative procedures are very complicated and have varied precedents,
                            but in recent years, the sequence has been:</p>
                        <p>1. The Senate convenes in a Committee of the Whole and takes up the
                            Treaties as reported from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with
                            Committee amendments expressed in recommended report language.</p>
                        <p>2. Amendments from the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> are the
                            first amendments considered in the order they are presented by the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>3. Additional amendments are then considered in the order that they are
                            brought up in the Committee as a Whole. Historically, the Committee of
                            the Whole read the Treaties article by article, and non-Committee
                            amendments to articles were considered as each article was raised. This
                            is a long and time-consuming process and has not been employed since the
                            Second World War. However, on these Treaties we can expect the
                            opposition to demand this procedure. There is no limit to the number of
                            amendments to each article prior to the filing of a cloture petition.
                            Cloture may eventually be necessary on this debate.</p>
                        <p>4. The Committee of the Whole votes on the Treaties as amended and
                            reports them to the full Senate.</p>
                        <p>5. In a <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> vote, the full Senate votes on
                            the Treaties as reported from the Committee of the Whole.</p>
                        <p>6. Both Treaties will be voted on together.</p>
                        <p>Amendments to treaties are passed by a simple majority. Obviously, these
                            Treaties will not pass without amendment. Many Senators will only be
                            able to justify a vote for the Treaty if they have forced Panama and the
                            Administration to accept restrictive amendments.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the State Department should have on hand reasonably acceptable
                            versions, where possible, of all major amendments to be <pb n="346"

                            “against” us on some amendments is the only politically viable approach
                            for many Senators. The bottom line for all these amendments is whether
                            they are acceptable to Panama politically and whether Panama can legally
                            accept the amendments without a new plebiscite.</p>

                            the Treaty fight. This will require active day-by-day guidance from the

                            The actual organizational structure should be worked out with Senator

                        </p>
                        <p>There has been a great deal of debate over the timing of the President’s
                            television address, as well as numerous suggestions from the Hill on
                            format. Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> has
                            encouraged the President to go on television in early January and then
                            again during the floor debate.<note n="10" xml:id="d124fn10">

                                    114</ref>.</note> If the address is made in early January, it
                            would have the advantage of being the first major policy statement of
                            the New Year and could be a good foundation to launch into the Senate
                            debate.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a great many others on the Hill argue that we must
                            begin educating the American people on the terms of the Treaty. The
                            sooner this is accomplished, the sooner the political heat will die
                            down. Additionally, there is a growing belief that the President is not
                            committed wholeheartedly to the Treaties and an earlier address could
                            lay this issue to rest. Obviously, we must also deal with the networks
                            since they are stingy with air time.</p>
                        <p>We think the following plan would be the best way to proceed. The
                            President should conduct a town meeting in mid-December, inviting
                            questions on Panama, energy and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.
                            He should then have a “Fireside Chat” or oval office speech on the eve
                            of the Senate debate.<note n="12" xml:id="d124fn12">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> highlighted this
                                paragraph. See <ref target="#d99fn6">footnote 6, Document 99</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d125fn4">footnote 4, Document 125.</ref>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The town meeting format in mid-December would not reach as large an
                            audience as a “Fireside Chat”, but it has several advantages:</p>
                        <p>1. Many say it is the President’s most effective forum.</p>
                        <p>2. The December date could silence critics who say the President is not
                            acting early enough.</p>
                        <p>3. It preserves the option of a more formal, nationally televised speech
                            just prior to the Senate debate.</p>
                        <p>4. By taking questions on Panama <hi rend="italic">and</hi> energy, the
                            President cannot be accused of deemphasizing the latter at a critical
                            stage in the Congressional process. In fact, he would have an
                            opportunity to comment publicly on progress of the conference
                            committees.</p>
                        <p>5. The town meeting would receive maximum press attention, possibly
                            national television coverage for the entire event. This possibility
                            would be greatly enhanced if the town meeting were held in hostile
                            territory and tough questions were guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>6. It would present a chance to help two key Senators by having the
                            meeting in their State.</p>
                        <p>7. It would convince the Hill and the American people that the President
                            is willing to face the public on this issue in the most direct way.</p>
                        <p>8. Because the mid-December date is virtually upon us, it would take
                            opponents by surprise and give them little time to organize a
                            counter-event.</p>
                        <pb n="348" facs="0383" xml:id="pg_348"/>
                        <p>9. It would be conducted in the Christmas season when peace and goodwill
                            prevail.</p>
                        <p>We suggest Louisville, Kentucky, as the location. Senators <persName
                                corresp="#p_FWH_1">Ford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HW_1"
                                >Huddleston</persName> are both key to our efforts. Kentucky has a
                            traditional relationship with the Canal Zone since the Federal judge is
                            appointed from Kentucky. Most Kentuckians oppose the Treaties, so the
                            President could not be accused of preaching to the choir. However, the
                            city’s major newspapers favor the Treaties. In addition, it is only a
                            short flight from Washington, and the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> organization could be counted on for help.</p>
                        <p>After the town meeting we should seek statements of support from both
                            Democratic and Republican Senators whom we know to be favorable but have
                            remained publicly uncommitted. This will require some arm twisting since
                            support before Christmas exposes Senators to political heat over the
                            recess.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Other Initiatives</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to the President’s appeal, continuing efforts by private
                            organizations to develop grassroots’ support for the Treaties in
                            targeted states is essential. More friendly Senators should be mobilized
                            in this effort. There still is little visible sign—i.e., mail—of support
                            for the Treaties on the Hill. It is essential that this happen. If we
                            get nothing else out of the Citizens’ Group or other support groups, we
                            must get mail.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we should recommend opinion leaders who might contact
                            individual Senators over the recess. These could include both home-state
                            and national figures.</p>
                        <p>Whatever we decide, we should keep in mind that constant pressure must be
                            kept on Senators while they are away from Washington to avoid losing
                            fence-sitters, and to keep up the impression that we are making
                            progress.</p>

                            basis, several of the groups might be prepared to campaign for approval

                            <p>Since Panama’s unique geographic location makes it important to the
                                environment of many nations, both the United States and Panama are
                                conscious of the need to protect the environment and respond to the
                                public health needs of the Canal Zone and the surrounding area.</p>
                            <p>During the negotiation of the Panama Canal treaties, the Department
                                of State and other agencies of the United States Government
                                recognized the serious environmental implications of the treaties’
                                key provisions. The United States noted that the transfer of large
                                tracts of essentially undeveloped territory, comprising much of the
                                Canal Zone, to a country energetically engaged in economic
                                development could seriously impact on the ecology of the area.
                                Accordingly, the negotiators included Article VI as an integral part
                                of the Panama Canal Treaty. In that article, the United States and
                                Panama commit themselves to implement the treaty “in a manner
                                consistent with the protection of the natural environment.” The
                                article also provides for the establishment of a Joint Commission on
                                the Environment, which is to recommend environmental protection
                                measures to the two governments.</p>
                            <pb n="353" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_353"/>
                            <p>Such is the framework for environmental action established by the
                                written instrument. However, it will only be through the joint
                                effort of the two governments, following ratification of the
                                treaties, that the commitments made in the treaties will come into
                                effect. For the United States, this will entail provision of
                                relevant information about the Canal Zone and its resources,
                                technical assistance, as well as resources needed to carry out
                                effective programs of environmental protection. To that end, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Agency for International
                                Development is developing a project, in cooperation with the
                                Panamanian Government, to provide it with the capability to carry
                                out sound land and water management and reforestation programs.</p>
                            <p>On the Panamanian side, our diplomatic mission in Panama has noted
                                that the Panamanian Government is taking environmental concerns
                                seriously and has attached a high priority to the problem of
                                protecting the Canal watershed. As evidence of this, the mission
                                reports that both the Panamanian Minister of Planning and the Vice
                                Minister of Agriculture have recently pressed for early
                                implementation of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Watershed
                                Management Project. Moreover, in addition to the provisions
                                contained in the Panama Canal Treaty, there is also a basis in
                                international law for <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and
                                Panamanian cooperation on environmental matters since both countries
                                are parties to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention
                                of Pollution of the Sea by Oil and the 1940 Convention on Nature
                                Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere,
                                which established Barro Colorado Island as a Nature Monument.</p>
                            <p>It is our intention that the Joint Environmental Commission shall
                                have the staff and financial support it needs to be effective. We
                                will propose that the American members of this Commission include
                                leading science and environmental figures as well as others from the
                                private and public sector. In addition, reports on the state of the
                                environment in the Canal Zone and the surrounding watershed will be
                                assembled and indexed. Federal agencies with expertise relevant to
                                Canal Zone issues will assist in developing information for the
                                Joint Commission on matters which require priority attention. And,
                                recognizing the importance of base-line data showing the current
                                state of Canal Zone ecosystems, including air and water quality,
                                marine life in the adjacent oceans, and flora and fauna, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> will cooperate with the Panamanian
                                Government in assembling that data espeditiously.</p>
                            <p>The National Environmental Policy Act (<gloss target="#t_NEPA_1"
                                    >NEPA</gloss>) has provided useful guidance in drafting the
                                Panama Canal treaties so as to avoid or mitigate the adverse
                                environmental effects which might result from the implementation of
                                the treaties. We recognized the importance of the <gloss

                                environmentally sound policies as well as the value of public

                                by the Joint Environmental Commission. And, the public comments
                                submitted regarding the draft <gloss target="#t_EIS_1">EIS</gloss>
                                have been carefully considered and are reflected in the final
                                Statement. More specifically, the final Environmental Impact
                                Statement discusses current and transitional steps needed to protect
                                the Pipeline Road and other important forest areas. It also analyzes
                                the need for a forestry management program and the dangers to flora,
                                fauna and soils should the natural resources of the Canal Zone not
                                be adequately protected.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in addition to Article VI, Article XII of the Panama Canal
                                Treaty addresses the question of expansion of the existing Panama
                                Canal to accommodate a larger volume of traffic. In that article,
                                Panama grants to the United States “the right to add a third lane of
                                locks to the existing Panama Canal.” With respect to a possible
                                sea-level canal, the article provides for a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >study</hi> of the feasibility of such a canal without making a
                                decision or commitment that a sea-level canal will be built. Any
                                study of the construction of a sea-level canal will seek to be both
                                thorough and objective as it examines both the economic as well as
                                the engineering feasibility of such a project. In addition, the
                                study would fully explore the environmental consequences of a
                                sea-level canal and would address the problems identified in the
                                reports of the National Academy of Sciences. Moreover, an
                                Environmental Impact Statement would be prepared in accordance with
                                the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. Finally, I
                                should note here that we do not intend to use nuclear excavation
                                techniques in connection with any effort to enlarge the capacity of
                                the Panama Canal or build a new canal, both for environmental
                                reasons and because of the terms of the nuclear test ban treaty.</p>
                            <p>In sum, we believe that the new Panama Canal treaties offer a
                                significant opportunity for cooperation between Panama and the
                                United States, not only in the operation of an important
                                international waterway, but also in safeguarding the unique
                                environment which forms part of the Canal Zone.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Panama Canal Treaties</hi>. I met today with senior
                            staff members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the
                            Panama Canal treaties. Norvill <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1"
                                >Jones</persName>, Staff Director, indicated that the Committee will
                            hold hearings on the treaties January 19, 20 and 25 and that mark-up
                            will take place on January 26. He thinks it is quite possible that the
                            treaties could be considered on the floor of the Senate in early
                            February.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName> expressed the view that it
                            will be difficult to prevent amendments from being attached to the
                            treaties, since amendments, as opposed to reservations or
                            understandings, would be necessary to enable certain Senators to justify
                            their vote for the treaties. As a minimum, <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1"
                                >Jones</persName> indicated he thought that the Senate would seek to
                            amend the terms of the October 14 Statement of Understanding into the
                            Panama Neutrality Treaty. Throughout the meeting I stressed the
                            Administration’s desire to constructively work with the Senate to secure
                            ratification of the treaty but our opposition to the attachment of any
                            amendment or other provision which would open up the treaties and create
                            the need for a further plebicite in Panama.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2"

                                position that no treaty changes were required. Torrijos’s
                                flexibility thus “undercut our strategy of holding the line against

                        <p>The discussion centered predominantly on the prospects for ratification
                            of the Panama Canal Treaties, in the light of the visits of various
                            groups of Senators to Panama, most recently Senator <persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> was plainly
                            encouraged by what he regarded as the successful results of the meetings

                            Senators <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> and <persName

                            handled himself well, and that the prospects for favorable votes on the
                            Treaties by the visiting Senators had been improved. It seemed to him
                            that a great deal now depended on how Senators <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> concerted in working out tactics in the Senate. If
                            both of them applied themselves energetically, he thought the prospects
                            for ratification were bright. He emphasized, however, that this was not
                            a matter which he, as a Panamanian, could influence.</p>
                        <p>We inquired as to General Torrijos’s views on treaty amendments. Perhaps
                            for tactical reasons, <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> was
                            emphatic in stating that the language of the Treaties could not be
                            changed without requiring a second plebiscite—and they did not intend to
                            have another. This meant that the text of the October 14 Statement of
                            Understanding could not be included in the Neutrality Treaty through an
                            amendment of its terms. What <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> does envisage is signature of the October 14 text
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and General
                            Torrijos. But this must take place only at the final and decisive
                            moment, so as to have the greatest impact and not to open the door to
                            additional proposals for change.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> confirmed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> really did not care whether
                            the provisions of Paragraph 2, Article 12 of the Basic Panama Treaty
                            relating to <pb n="358" facs="0393" xml:id="pg_358"/>a sea-level canal
                            were included in the Treaty. He said it would require a plebiscite to
                            remove them, but made this comment without the conviction he had applied
                            to his remark on the October 14 statement.</p>
                        <p>In his discussion with <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>,
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> asserted,
                            according to <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>, that
                            anywhere from 40 to 80 amendments might be proposed as the Treaties were
                            discussed in the Senate. However, almost all of these would disappear as
                            the Senate moved toward a decision. The Panamanians should not be
                            alarmed.</p>
                        <p>We asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> whether
                            any other Treaty changes had been discussed by Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>. He answered in the negative.
                            Responding to specific inquiries, he said that nothing had been said
                            about amending the financial arrangements in the Treaties; the problem
                            of ratification was an emotional, not a financial one. He also said that
                            the question of flags had not been raised, but that if it were, nothing
                            was to be expected, since the Panamanians would not agree to anything
                            which would impinge on their sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the human rights question. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> stressed the extent to which
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had gone in
                            restoring democratic practices. As the most recent example, he described
                            the convention of the Panamenista Party of <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1"
                                >Arias</persName>, which had met in Santiago on January 8. It had
                            been extremely critical of Torrijos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> also commented on the
                            possible return of Panamanian exiles. He said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was willing to permit the
                            right-wingers, members of the oligarchy, to come back; but there was no
                            way to do so without at the same time admitting the 25 or so
                            left-wingers, most of whom were in Cuba. If they were admitted, it would
                            be after ratification.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>, the visit of
                            the Inter-American Human Rights Commission was successful.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d130fn3">See <ref target="#d102fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    102</ref>.</note> The Commission might criticize the conditions
                            in Panamanian prisons, which were admittedly poor, but would also take
                            note of the improved situation with respect to human rights
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> relayed some words of
                            advice given by <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Fidel Castro</persName> to
                            Torrijos. In dealing with the Americans, <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Castro</persName> said: “You must never do three things: never say
                            they are a second-rate power; never mention Puerto Rico; and never
                            accuse them of bad faith.” It seemed to <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> to have been good advice.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am taking the liberty of sending along these comments with respect to
                            the next steps in connection with the ratification of the Panama Canal
                            Treaties. I do so based on the long discussion I had at lunch on January
                            13th with Senator <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Robert Byrd</persName>
                            and my further conversations with various members of the Senate—on both
                            sides of the aisle.</p>
                        <p>There has, of course, been considerable talk about the need to “amend”
                            the Treaties in order to meet the questions or objections of various
                            Senators. The problem is that the words “amendment”, “reservation”,
                            “understanding”, “interpretation” are often used interchangeably based
                            on a misconception as to how one differs from the other. Thus both
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> and Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>, among others, have
                            referred to the need for “amending” or “clarifying” or “interpreting”
                            the Treaties on the issues of our right to defend and expeditious
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>During my conversation with Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> I pointed out that it should be possible to find a
                            way to have the Statement of Understanding issued by you and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> incorporated in the
                            approval by the Senate without actually changing the language of the
                            Treaties themselves. I stressed the fact that since the Chief Executives
                            of both countries had clearly agreed that the Statement sets forth what
                            they had both intended when they signed the Treaties, the Senate could
                            approve the Treaties <hi rend="italic">on the condition that the
                                Statement of Understanding be appended to the Treaties with the same
                                force and effect as though contained therein</hi>. Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> seemed impressed with this as a
                            possible answer.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution of Panama specifically provides that the Treaties made
                            by the Executive with respect to the Canal “must be submitted to a
                            national plebiscite”. In the plebiscite actually held on September 13,
                                1977,<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">The Panamanian plebiscite on the
                                treaties was held on October 23.</note> the Panamanian voters were
                            asked to vote yes or no on the following proposition: “I am in agreement
                            with the new Panama Canal Treaty, the Treaty concerning the permanent
                            neutrality and operation of the Panama Canal and the Connected and
                            Annexed Agreements <pb n="361" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_361"/>between the
                            governments of Panama and the United States of America signed by them on
                            Wednesday, September 7, 1977”. From this language it appears likely that
                            any <hi rend="italic">textual</hi> change in the Treaty could require
                            another plebiscite. The same need not be true if ratification involves
                            incorporating the Statement of Understanding between you and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and, thereby, makes
                            explicit what was implicit in the Treaty language as approved by the
                            Panamanian voters who were aware of the Statement of Understanding
                            before the plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>Although General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has
                            apparently indicated to Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1"
                                >Baker</persName> that he would not object to a new plebiscite, the
                            fact is that amending the Treaties will open up the negotiations for
                            other proposed amendments from the Panamanians. (There is good reason to
                            believe that there are some things in the Treaties which Panama would
                            like to change if it could—although this has not yet been made clear.)
                            Certainly it should not be necessary for the Panamanians to have to go
                            through a whole plebiscite procedure again in order to reaffirm what
                            they have already approved.</p>

                                >Baker</persName> said his interest in deleting the provision was
                            purely tactical, i.e., he hoped it would pick up votes, particularly
                            that of Senator Griffin. <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>
                            said, however, that Griffin seemed to be turning against the Treaties,
                            and that he was prepared to shelve efforts to delete the provision for
                            the time being. Both <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> and

                            another recent treaty, the Alcan pipeline agreement.<note n="16"

                        <p>2. We are mature and confident; fairness is a function of greatness.
                            Also, our strength has always rested on our ability to adapt to
                            change.</p>

                        <p>2. They make the Panamanians our partners in Canal’s defense, rather than
                            indifferent bystanders.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus they make it easier, not harder, to defend Canal.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Panama</hi>. The Foreign Relations Committee today
                            considered what specific amendments and understandings it will recommend
                            to the Senate. After extensive discussion, the Committee decided to
                            recommend that the October 14 Statement of Understanding be added as a
                            new article 9 of the Neutrality Treaty. The article would read as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The United States of America and the Republic of Panama,</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Recognizing</hi> that the President of the United
                            States and the Chief of Government of the Republic of Panama have set
                            forth a correct and authoritative statement of certain rights and duties
                            of the Parties under Articles IV and VI of the Treaty Concerning the
                            Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal in Statements
                            issued by the Government of the United States of America and the
                            Government of the Republic of Panama on October 14, 1977, and October
                            18, 1977, respectively,</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Have Decided</hi> and hereby do incorporate that
                            statement as an integral part of the treaty as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">(FOLLOWED BY FULL TEXT OF OCTOBER 14 AGREEMENT)</p>
                        <p>We consider this to be a satisfactory approach since it preserves the
                            exact form of the October 14 statement and does not seek to alter the
                            text of the Treaties as negotiated. The Committee rejected amendments to
                            delete the sealevel canal provisions, recommending only an understanding
                            which would preserve the President’s constitutional right to “confer”
                            with nations other than Panama on the construction of a new waterway.
                            The Committee will continue and (we hope) conclude action on the
                            treaties on Monday.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">January 30.</note>

                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was ambiguous about the
                            acceptability of an actual amendment to the Neutrality Treaty. He said
                            he had no problem with the substance of the Foreign Relations
                            Committee’s recommended new Article IX,<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note> but that he was
                            concerned that it took the form of a new article.</p>
                        <p>2. Asked if the addition of the new article would require a new
                            plebiscite here, he replied at one point, “I don’t think so.” But later
                            he moved away from that position. He urged that the language be
                            incorporated in an annex or in some other way, which could even be
                            placed above the signatures, or in an exchange of notes. But he asked
                            rhetorically how you could add a new article and still say that the
                            original treaty was the same as the one with an additional article.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> repeated that he has
                            an open mind on these questions. He also said that if it was unavoidable
                            that there be a plebiscite on this question, he would hold one, however
                            dangerous it would be. He made it clear he would strongly prefer to
                            avoid that course.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would not say yes or
                            no on the committee’s recommended understanding on the sea-level
                                canal,<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">Ibid.</note> though he did opine
                            that it would be more salable in Panama than the new Article IX. He said
                            that giving the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> the right to confer
                            with third parties without giving Panama reciprocity would be “too
                            comfortable” for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> He would
                            prefer to drop the entire article. (Presumably he meant paragraph 2 of
                            Article XII.) In any case, Panama would have to have the same right of
                            consultation. Elimination of the article would give Panama something
                            too, which he would take to his people.</p>
                        <p>5. Domestic politics. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            said that he had publicly announced some time ago that if any party
                            could get sufficient adherents it would have the right to be a legal

                            may run for office. Romulo Escobar Baten<pb n="367" facs="0402"

                            needs a law of parties which would establish the number of members
                            required for legal status. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> was asked about his future, and he responded in
                            general terms that he would like to retreat gradually from the scene. He
                            set no time frame. At least one of the senators interpreted this as
                            meaning that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would not
                            run for President this fall.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Torrijos’s advisers (<persName
                                corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"

                                Revilla</persName>) were present and were clearly concerned about
                            where the October understanding would be placed in the treaty package.
                            They quite correctly recognize that, if a new article is included and
                            there is no new plebiscite, future detractors of the treaties’
                            legitimacy will have a readier handle to attack them than they would
                            otherwise have.</p>
                        <p>7. In a press conference Saturday night Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_2">Cranston</persName> said that if Article IX is
                            necessary to obtain 67 votes for the treaty, he favors its inclusion; if
                            changing the form whereby the October understanding would be
                            incorporated some other way would not endanger the treaties’ passage, he
                            might consider such a change in form. I think this is a wise
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>8. As for the domestic political questions raised in the talks, I believe
                            the future of both the parties and <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> are still undetermined—and indeed
                            undeterminable until the treaty question is out of the way.</p>

                        <p>Because of the recent accords on Panama, the publicity Senator <persName

                            deceptive vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, many people
                            have relaxed on the Hill and in the Administration thinking the treaty
                            fight has been won. We are still 9 votes short of the necessary 67, and
                            any combination of 67 votes that we can see is very fragile.</p>
                        <p>Some Senators who will vote for final passage will find it very difficult
                            to vote against emotional amendments (flag amendment) which do not mean
                            much to us but would be degrading to Panamanians.</p>

                        <p>Although we have good momentum now for ratification of the treaties, we
                            have some tough days ahead. There will be the conservative reaction to
                            your speech<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">See <ref target="#d99fn6"

                            </note> and the fact that the members of the Senate who have not taken a
                            public position will be besieged by their own constituents when they go
                            home for the recess. Add to that the fact that some recent overly
                            optimistic press reports have diminished the sense of urgency which
                            should surround the ratification process.</p>
                        <p>We have many political resources that we can and should bring to bear on
                            the Senate. Right now our approach to the ratification process is
                            diffused. We need to focus these resources and make each of several key
                            people feel personal responsibility for one or two votes.</p>

                            that you have a meeting of the following persons who are Washington
                            based and call the balance on the telephone, and ask each person to live
                            with and work on one of two Senators in the undecided catagory. You
                            obviously will want to defer to them as to which Senators they know
                            best. <hi rend="italic">But, it will only work if you look <persName

                            get very little help out of these people.</p>

                        <p>10. The Vice President said that debate on the Panama Canal treaties
                            begins in the Senate on Wednesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">February
                                8.</note> He said that the issue is “fundamental to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Presidency” and that “losing
                            would be a disaster.” There are still ten to twenty undecided votes; he
                            urged each Cabinet member to review a list of the undecided Senators
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MF_2">Frank Moore</persName> to see if they
                            could be of any help.</p>

                        <p>19. The President said that the vote on the Panama Canal treaties is
                            critically important to the Administration. He asked several Cabinet
                            members to stay after the meeting to discuss ways they might help in
                            discussing the matter with key, undecided Senators. He noted that we
                            have climbed from a position of virtually no support for the treaties to
                            a slight plurality. He has personally attended more than twenty
                            briefings at the White House with various groups from around the
                            country. In addition to the Administration’s efforts, key people from
                            the business community and state and local government are now advocating
                            ratification of the treaties with various Senators.<note n="3"

                        <p>The following are the talking points for the President to use in making
                            his calls to the Senators discussed this morning.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Senator <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Cannon</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Senator will express serious concerns over the economic aspects of
                            the Treaties. He was very critical during Armed Services Committee
                            hearings. The President should reassure him that the Canal will be
                            economically viable under the Treaty and tell him that the Arthur

                        </p>
                        <p>The President should also tell <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Cannon</persName> that defeat of the Treaties will cripple him as
                            President and deal a major blow to our foreign policy. Now that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Cannon</persName> is chairman of a major
                            committee, he should be willing to play a leadership role on important
                            issues such as this.</p>
                        <p>The President can also point to the February 1 Gallup Poll showing
                            Americans favor the Treaties 45 percent to 42 percent.<note n="6"

                                >Randolph</persName> at least 3 times. This time, he should again

                        <p>The President should explain he will go all out to help the Senator in
                            his reelection bid, including a visit to his state. Administration
                            officials can brief veterans or other groups if the Senator wishes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Senator Young</p>
                        <p>We have had very little contact with him. The President should emphasize
                            the support of the Joint Chiefs for the Treaties and highlight their
                            input to the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Senator may respond to a plan based on the necessity for a strong
                            Presidency in matters of foreign policy. The President should point out
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, Senator

                        <p>The Senator is a hard-bitten political realist who has told <persName

                            Treaties. <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> still believes
                            he can get Stevens, however.<note n="8" xml:id="d142fn8">

                        <p>The President may want to dwell on the importance of a neutral and
                            accessible Canal to shipment of Alaska oil. The Senator could also
                            respond to a personal appeal based on the importance of the Treaties to
                            Latin American relations.</p>
                        <p>Stevens may counter with some barbs about the “d-2 lands” issue.<note

                        </opener>
                        <p>As debate begins on the Canal Treaties, questions have arisen about the
                            financial viability of the Canal under the new arrangements and also
                            about financial obligations the United States will incur as a result of
                            the new Treaties. Enclosed are answers to some of the principal
                            questions which have been raised.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Undated,
                                attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the last analysis, the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> security
                            and commercial interests these new Treaties are designed to serve cannot
                            be measured in dollars. Under the past arrangements, the benefits that
                            we have received from the Canal have far outweighed the costs of
                            construction, security and the nominal annuity paid to Panama. We feel
                            the costs associated with <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> operation
                            of the Canal between now and the year 2000 will be more than offset by
                            the benefits derived from our continued use of the Canal during an
                            orderly and efficient transition to Panamanian <pb n="378" facs="0413"

                        <p>18. The President asked the Cabinet to continue its efforts on the Panama
                            Canal treaties. He said that it will be difficult to get the last 10 to
                            12 votes needed to assure Senate ratification. In the President’s
                            discussions with Republicans, he stresses the need for bipartisanship;
                            the support of former President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName>, Vice President Rockefeller, and Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>; the support of
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff who were appointed by a Republican
                            Administration; and the advantage of taking a worldwide perspective as
                            against pursuing parochial interests. With Democrats, he underscores the
                            importance of party unity and the devastating effect that defeat of the
                            treaties would have for the Administration. He said that the public
                            opinion polls are slowly turning in our direction, although he added
                            that those who are opposed to the treaties are more vocal than those who
                            support them. He commended and expressed his appreciation for the
                            excellent help being given by former President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, Vice President Rockefeller and
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.
                            There is widespread business community support for the treaties, and
                            Senators <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> have committed their support to

                            <salute>Dear Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Because, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I agree, passage of the Panama
                            Canal treaties is important to our national security, I have followed
                            the Senate debate on the new Panama Canal treaties with a great deal of
                            interest. Having again reviewed the national security aspects of the new
                            treaties in detail, I am acutely aware of the major defense issues which
                            the Senate has focused upon in recent days. As a result, I would like to
                            comment upon one facet of the defense issue that was not discussed
                            during my testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee last
                            September—the matter of a residual United States military presence in
                            Panama after the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense position on this issue is that we do not
                            advocate a military presence in Panama after expiration of the defense
                            treaty. The 1974 <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Tack</persName>-<persName

                                Principles<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">See <ref target="#d3fn10"

                            </note> established the fact that the Canal treaty would have a fixed
                            termination date—which, in effect, terminates the legal basis for a
                            United States military presence. Therefore, our primary post-treaty
                            concern was to establish a legal right to defend the Canal, to include
                            introduction of <pb n="386" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_386"/>troops into
                            Panama should the neutrality or security of the Canal be threatened.
                            This issue was deliberated within the Defense establishment over a
                            period of several years. These deliberations recognized that any United
                            States military presence in Panama would require a termination date
                            directly related to our responsibility for operation of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>This evolutionary process concluded with Panama’s finally accepting our
                            draft neutrality treaty which permits the United States to guarantee the
                            Canal’s neutrality unilaterally and to take action to enforce the
                            related regime for an indefinite period of time. Thus, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> and I deemed it preferable, on
                            balance, to accept a somewhat shorter period of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military presence in Panama in exchange for a
                            neutrality treaty with no termination date.</p>
                        <p>The Neutrality Treaty before the Senate contains the necessary legal
                            authority for the United States to maintain the Canal’s neutrality—by
                            force if necessary. An amendment to the treaty which gives the United
                            States the unilateral right to continue its military presence in Panama
                            after the year 2000 is not necessary from a defense standpoint. Such an
                            unnecessary provision in the treaty would serve only to create friction
                            and discord within Panama—avoidance of which is a major consideration in
                            our modernization of the 1903 treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">See

                            </note> Under some scenarios, a residual <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military presence would perhaps facilitate re-entry,
                            should that unlikely event be necessary for Canal defense; however, it
                            is clearly not acceptable to Panama. Neither Panama nor any other nation
                            would voluntarily accept the unilateral right of another to maintain a
                            military presence within its sovereign territory.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of military reasons why a residual military presence
                            is not necessary:</p>
                        <p>—Only the United States has the regional capability to guarantee the
                            neutrality of the Canal by military force.</p>
                        <p>—The United States possesses the capability for timely deployment of
                            superior forces by air and sea in the face of military opposition, and
                            to employ them effectively to secure the Canal with or without
                            Panamanian support.</p>
                        <p>—External security and protection of the sea and air approaches to the
                            Canal will continue to be maintained by the United States from <gloss
                                target="#t_CONUS_1">CONUS</gloss> and bases in the Caribbean.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the United States will continue to have the capability to
                            project forces from <gloss target="#t_CONUS_1">CONUS</gloss> into the
                            Canal area to meet threats to the neutrality regime. Successful defense
                            of the Canal after the year <pb n="387" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_387"
                            />2000 is not dependent on residual base rights. It is more important
                            from a Defense view to have the new treaties and a satisfactory climate
                            in Panama rather than a base in Panama beyond the period that we operate
                            the Canal. Our ability to defend and control access to the Canal is
                            essential, but the issue is how that ability can be best assured—by a
                            cooperative effort with a friendly Panama or by a garrison amid hostile
                            surroundings. The treaties which you are debating provide real security,
                            not paper claims. They offer the firmest and most practical guarantees
                            obtainable that the Canal will remain operational, secure, and available
                            to the United States and the rest of the world. I remain increasingly
                            convinced that approval of the new Panama Canal treaties will best
                            provide for our future national security.</p>

                        <p>A strategy of dealing with undecided Senators one by one is not yielding
                            results. The undecideds are reluctant to announce their intentions
                            individually because of the great amount of press attention such a move
                            would elicit.</p>
                        <p>We will continue to make individual contacts, but we have adopted a
                            companion strategy that we hope will prompt some movement. We are
                            encouraging key undecideds on each side of the aisle to approach their
                            undecided colleagues urging them to coalesce around a package of
                            understandings and announce their intentions to support the Treaties
                            contingent upon Senate approval of the understandings or something
                            similar. By taking the plunge as a group, each Senator in the group
                            should be able to limit his individual exposure.</p>

                        <p>Three groups are underway—two inspired by us and one organized by
                            Senators themselves:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> is working
                            with Senator <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1">DeConcini</persName> and
                            indirectly with Senator <persName corresp="#p_FWH_1">Ford</persName>. If
                            something can be worked out, <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> will urge the Senators to approach <persName

                                corresp="#p_HM_1">Hatfield</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> is optimistic.</p>
                        <p>2. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHJ_2">Heinz</persName> has agreed to
                            try to put together a Republican group consisting of himself, <persName

                            understandings. <persName corresp="#p_BHL_1">Bellmon</persName> and
                            Schweiker are cosponsors of one. The Vice President meets with <persName

                            provide some inspiration.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">An unknown hand

                            steps to get access to this group to provide some direction. Obviously,
                            this is delicate.</p>

                        <p>The First Lady is extending an invitation to Senator and Mrs. Hatfield to
                            have dinner with you this week. The Senator will be informed that you
                            intend to discuss the Treaties with him. You will have <pb n="389"
                                facs="0424" xml:id="pg_389"/>to make a direct personal appeal for
                            his vote. You should recommend to <persName corresp="#p_HM_1"
                                >Hatfield</persName> that he help us put together a state briefing

                            ointment. The Senator is telling <persName corresp="#p_HM_1"
                                >Hatfield</persName> he should attack Baucus as a liberal and use
                            the latter’s support of the Treaties against him in the primary.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HM_1">Hatfield</persName> is known to be
                            interested in the Federal judgeship if he loses the primary to Baucus.
                            We think <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">Melcher</persName> has promised to
                            recommend him for the job. However, before he died, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ML_1">Lee Metcalf</persName> had recommended someone
                            else for the vacancy. <persName corresp="#p_ML_1">Metcalf</persName> was
                            a good friend of yours who supported you on all major issues, including
                            the Panama Canal Treaties. We do not know if <persName corresp="#p_HM_1"
                                >Hatfield</persName> is aware that <persName corresp="#p_ML_1"
                                >Metcalf</persName> had recommended a very capable Montanan for the
                            judgeship which he covets.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Long</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Senator is concerned about waterway user charge legislation. You
                            should talk to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Adams</persName>
                            today about this situation and urge him to deal directly with Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Long</persName> on this issue. The
                            Secretary has been using Senator Domenici as an intermediary in the
                            negotiations, urging Domenici to be as flexible as possible. If an
                            agreement is reached, we fear <persName corresp="#p_LR_1"
                                >Long</persName> will attribute it to Domenici’s good will rather
                            than ours.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Long</persName> is sounding much more
                            supportive now. He has said repeatedly he will support the Treaties if
                            we need him.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_ZE_1">Zorinsky</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_ZE_1">Zorinsky</persName> will take his
                            much-anticipated poll in Nebraska within the next 10 days. He has said
                            if the poll shows movement in favor of the Treaties, he will support
                            them. He has also stated he personally supports approval of the
                            Treaties. We have helped him draft questions for the poll.</p>
                        <p>It would be very persuasive to <persName corresp="#p_ZE_1"
                                >Zorinsky</persName> and others if Prime Minister Begin could
                            comment favorably on the Treaties when he is in the United States.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>The Senator has indicated privately he is leaning in favor of the
                            Treaties, but wants to wait until the last minute to make his move. Our

                        <p>We should leave <persName corresp="#p_BHL_1">Bellmon</persName> alone for
                            the time being and let Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHJ_2"
                                >Heinz</persName> try to include him in his group of undecideds.
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> is monitoring him
                            closely.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RWV_1">Roth</persName>

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_RWV_1">Roth</persName> is the most negative
                            of all our undecided Republicans. However, Irving Shapiro feels
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWV_1">Roth</persName> will eventually support
                            the Treaties. Shapiro is not close to <persName corresp="#p_RWV_1"
                                >Roth</persName>, but has suggested others (e.g., the President of
                            Hercules) who are good friends of his. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Sol
                                Linowitz</persName> has followed up on those suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Treaty advocates other than Shapiro have received favorable impressions
                            of <persName corresp="#p_RWV_1">Roth</persName>’s position.</p>
                        <p>The Senator is known to be upset over disapproval of funding for an
                            alcoholism treatment center in Delaware. We will talk with Secretary

                        <p>The Senator’s position is a mystery to everyone. We suspect he remains
                            undecided. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> spoke with
                            Schweiker by telephone last week and received favorable vibrations. He
                            will speak with him personally later this week.</p>
                        <p>We can help bring him into the fold by consulting with him on a more
                            regular basis about the coal strike. He reacted favorably to Dan Tate’s

                            leaders in Pennsylvania have contacted him (e.g., Governor Scranton,

                        <p>The Senator’s position softened perceptibly last week. <persName

                            him into using an understanding or reservation rather than an amendment
                            to solve his political problems. Outside groups and individuals have
                            made numerous contacts with the Senator. He is responding best to the
                            substantive discussions about the Treaties conducted by <persName

                        <p>The Senator continues to leave the door open on the Treaties, but he has
                            told many of the business executives who have contacted him that a
                            positive Treaty vote will cost him his election.</p>
                        <p>The citizens committee has made some progress with veterans in West

                        <p>We also suggest you invite the Senator in for breakfast as early as
                            possible some morning this week. As you know, the Senator is an

                        <p>The Senator stopped making negative comments on the Treaties last week,
                            but still doubts their wisdom. Senator <persName corresp="#p_LP_1"
                                >Laxalt</persName> foolishly announced to the press last week that

                                    >TNT</gloss> from a Panamanian explosives factory and the
                                unusual activity of members of the commando sabotage team, who would
                                be involved in the courses. This information would further incline
                                us to view the recent activity as a training/contingency effort with
                                a view toward the possibility of action should the treaties be voted
                                down.</p>
                            <p>2. However, some of the information such as [<hi rend="italic">1 line

                                the Panamanians were considering some action.</p>
                            <p>3. The Panamanians may be engaging in some of these activities in

                            <salute>Dear Senator <persName corresp="#p_TH_1">Talmadge</persName>
                            </salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I have followed with interest the Senate debate on the Panama Canal
                            Treaties of which I am strongly supportive as you undoubtedly know. Your
                            support is needed and I trust will be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>I understand that you have expressed concern about Article 5 of the
                            Neutrality Treaty. I have always felt that article very much favored
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in that, unlike the
                            current treaty arrangements, stationing of foreign troops anywhere on
                            Panamanian soil would be precluded.</p>
                        <p>I understand you are considering a reservation to the instrument of
                            ratification to the effect that the stationing of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> forces in Panama subsequent to the turn
                            of the century to protect the regime of neutrality would not be
                            precluded, should both countries feel it necessary or appropriate. While
                            I am not a lawyer, I don’t feel such a reservation is necessary. It is
                            not necessary for the treaty to spell out the steps we might take to
                            meet future contingencies; the important thing is that it does not
                            preclude the United States and Panama from negotiating, at a later date,
                            an arrangement for a <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military
                            presence in Panama after the year 2000. The present treaty thus gives us
                            the authority we need to protect the regime of neutrality while keeping
                            our options open.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, while I don’t feel the proposed reservation is necessary, at
                            the same time I cannot say that it would be undesirable if it could be
                            achieved without causing the treaties to require another plebiscite in
                            Panama.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>As you know, the Senate is now approaching the end of its debate on the
                            Neutrality Treaty. Although we expect the final vote to be close, we
                            remain hopeful about the result.</p>
                        <p>We have made good progress since last September when you and I signed the
                            Treaties. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the Treaties
                            by an overwhelming vote. In the Senate debate, we have fortunately been
                            able to prevent any amendments to the Treaty other than the so-called
                            “leadership” amendments to Articles IV and VI. These incorporate exactly
                            the terms of the statement of understanding published after our
                            conversation of October 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In considering its Resolution of Ratification of the Treaty, the Senate
                            will almost certainly attach a number of reservations, conditions or
                            understandings reflecting certain of its concerns. We have made every
                            effort and have been successful to date in ensuring that these will be
                            consistent with the general purposes of our two countries as parties to
                            the Treaty. I hope you will examine them in this light.</p>
                        <p>After approving the Neutrality Treaty, the Senate will move immediately
                            to consider the Basic Panama Treaty. While there will be problems, I am
                            hopeful that the outcome will again be favorable, and that the two
                            Treaties combined will gain for our countries the advantages we had
                            envisaged when we signed them last September.</p>
                        <p>I know that the long public discussion of the Treaties in the United
                            States has involved difficulties for you and your country. It has been a
                            necessary element in informing the American public of the reasons for
                            negotiating the Treaties and the benefits they bring to both parties. We
                            have made notable progress in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Thus, as matters stand today, we are approaching an important milestone.
                            If all of us can continue to work patiently and constructively for the
                            achievement of our objectives, I believe we can achieve the outcome we
                            both desire—sound and equitable treaties in our common interest.</p>

                            on some very important matters. I would like you to identify this as one
                            of the most important conversations we have ever had. The vote on the
                            Panama Canal Treaty to go into effect in the year 2000, the neutrality
                            treaty, will be held tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">The Senate
                                approved the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and
                                Operation of the Panama Canal (known as the Neutrality Treaty) by a
                                vote of 68 to 32 on March 16. For the texts of <persName

                            vote is very close and the results are in doubt, but I believe we will
                            win if there is nothing to cause a disturbance in the Senate. Some
                            reservations have been introduced which, sincerely, are not worded like
                            I would have preferred, and which cause me some concern. But they do not
                            violate the terms of the treaty as explained in our joint statement<note

                                    >Torrijos</persName>:</hi> That would be fine. But the root of
                            the problem is basically the following: We consider that we have gone to
                            the limit of the concessions we can make. A little bit more, and we will
                            have a <pb n="398" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_398"/>treaty which will comply
                            with the dictates of formality but which will be no solution to the
                            problem of peaceful and friendly coexistence between our peoples. I have
                            been reading and following the debates in the Senate. Our entire people
                            have been doing so as well. Some are of the opinion that the strong
                            emphasis being given to changing a period or a single comma is just a
                            disguise for retaining perpetuity, that principle which we have all
                            fought so hard to erradicate. I am much more interested in approving a
                            treaty which is really a working instrument and not one which will just
                            cause problems. I am more interested as is my people, in having the
                            United States guarantees be for transit through the Canal and not
                            ownership of it. I do not want <hi rend="italic">a</hi> treaty, I want
                            The Treaty which my people approved in the plebescite.</p>

                            drop with the parachute of dignity. All falls on the parachute of

                            <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> That was extremely clear. I would
                            just like to respond to two or three points if I may. First, nothing
                            that the Senate is doing we anticipate will change any of the agreements
                            or principles contained in the Treaty. Under the Senate amendments, the
                            transfer of ownership to Panama, the removal of perpetuity, and the
                            removal of all <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> forces by the year
                            2000 are all preserved. After the year 2000, according to our joint
                            statement and the amendments, the interest of the United States lies in
                            the regime of neutrality; in open access to the Canal. None of these
                            principles, made clear in the Treaty are being changed.</p>
                        <p>I would just make one other request of you. As soon as the vote is over,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> will be leaving to fly
                            to Panama to meet with you. I would ask you to make no public statement
                            of condemnation or concern until after you talk to our officials. Then,
                            of course, you are free to make any statement you wish, but after
                            consulting with them, and after ratification of the Treaties. They will
                            be there tomorrow night.</p>

                            us nothing has changed in what we signed together, and we will make no
                            statement until we have talked to your people.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> That is excellent. There is just
                            one other point. I have been working day and night for weeks and weeks
                            on this matter. It has been more important to me than any other and is
                            one of the most difficult political issues ever to face the American
                            people. If the treaties are rejected now, it will be years and years,
                            maybe 50 years, before any other president will wish to address the
                            issue again. I believe we have excellent chances to win, in a way that
                            will be a source of satisfaction to your people and a source of pride to
                            you. I very much appreciate you willingness to trust me for a few more
                            days, to wait and see what actions are taken by the Senate and by
                            me.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I want you to know that your personal friendship is very
                            valuable to me, as is that between the American and Panamanian peoples.
                            And I believe that the Treaties will bind all of us together in
                            permanent friendship. They are still in doubt, but we believe we will be
                            successful. Thank you for your understanding of our domestic problems.
                            Your decision today has been very valuable to us.</p>

                        <p>1. I agree: <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss>’s latest proposal
                            completely fails to serve our objective of successful treaty
                                implementation.<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d157fn2">footnote 2</ref> above.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. I have no objection to reaffirming that the relationship between the
                            Ambassador and the area military commander here be the same as in any
                            other foreign country. Here, as anywhere, the latter is properly
                            responsible to the President as Commander-in-Chief; this pattern of
                            official relationships is a well-established and generally workable one.
                            But it would be a fundamental error to accept <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>’s desire to afford a similar legal autonomy to the
                            Canal Commission. No matter what agency oversees the Canal operation, it
                            will not be a military responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief. It will
                            be a civilian agency, and there is absolutely no reason to accept such
                            an unprecedented legal status in a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>3. No one has publicly justified why the commission should be different
                            in this manner. Not to mince words, the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>/Army/PanCanal unstated assumption is that the
                            Ambassador will either have a vested bureaucratic interest in “keeping
                            Panama happy” at the expense of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            operational interests in the Canal, or will seek to “run the Canal.” But
                            in my view, he would do neither; the Ambassador’s proper role is to get
                            Panama to do that which is in the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            national interest, with the least possible fuss and friction in the
                            process.</p>
                        <p>4. The President and Congress have recognized for years that
                            ambassadorial authority over and responsibility for all aspects of

                            can pursue a coherent foreign policy. If one accepts that an overseas

                            authority, one starts a pernicious process of watering down statutes <pb

                            situation.</p>
                        <p>5. One cannot speak of insulating the ’technical’ Canal operation from
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panama bilateral relations.
                            Those relations, and the new treaties, are about the Canal. All other
                            considerations are secondary, and the new treaties will not change this.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> expects to make a success of
                            treaty implementation, it badly needs to get its own act together. If
                            the Ambassador, the President’s personal representative responsible for
                            relations with Panama, is faced with an administrator legally free to
                            formulate and pursue his own foreign policy toward Panama, the result
                            will be a mess.</p>
                        <p>6. Whether anyone in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> realizes it or
                            not, the administrator is going to badly need the support and protection
                            that an Ambassador can provide. State and the Ambassador have an
                            expertise in dealing with foreign governments which the administrator
                            may well lack. Most problems will undoubtedly lend themselves to being
                            worked out in the commission. But willy-nilly, others will be raised to
                            the government-to-government level. Both the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government and the administrator himself will be
                            well-served if the Ambassador is properly empowered to promote our
                            interests. In the past, the Governor has been able to effectively ignore
                            the wishes of the Panamanian Government. In the future, the situation
                            will not be so one-sided. If, in the future, the administrator, by any
                            act or omission, however easily remediable, commits a misstep in his
                            relations with Panama, there will be no meaningful channel to deal with
                            the situation. We would be well advised to have on the scene someone who
                            could speak with the voice of the entire <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>7. Separation of the administrator from the Ambassador’s authority is an
                            open and continuing invitation to friction between the two, and to
                            exploitation of the separation by Panama, to the detriment of the canal
                            operation and our overall interests here. It is something that the
                            Department must not allow to happen.<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">In a

                                the Panama Canal Treaty. Once the Panamanian government had both

                        <p>The Senate has now commenced debate on the Panama Canal Treaty. Once
                            again, we will urge the Senate to resist any amendments to the body of
                            the treaty as well as any reservations or conditions which are
                            inconsistent with the basic purposes and spirit of the treaty. Two such
                            amendments were defeated today.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">According to

                                defeated. Senator Malcolm Wallop (R–Wyoming) also offered an
                                amendment that would have revived the 1903 treaty if Panama
                                abrogated all or any part of the new Panama Canal Treaty. (Carter

                                reservation he proposed and that the Senate adopted with the
                                Neutrality Treaty. The reservation outlined the right of the United
                                States to take unilateral action in Panama, including the use of
                                military force, after the year 2000 if the Canal was closed for any

                                    >DeConcini</persName> to revise his proposed reservation to make

                            meaning of the memorandum of understanding which we signed together. I
                            would like you to know that during the course of this week I have been
                            making great efforts to improve matters in order to be able to reply to
                            sectors of public opinion which have been trying to orchestrate a
                            campaign to make necessary a second plebescite. If one were held now,
                            the treaties would not be approved because this is a very sensitive
                            issue. Any further amendment to the language would not be approved.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we must stay in close touch, in close communication so that the
                            treaties which emerge will be instruments of work and not elements of
                            perturbation. What Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1">DeConcini</persName>
                            has said runs counter to the principles and provisions of the United
                            Nations and of the Organization of American States, both bodies to which
                            Panama belongs and for which it has deep respect.</p>
                        <p>It is really very strong language, so strong that one would not think it
                            could deal with a friendly country. Only if we keep in touch can we hope
                            to have a treaty—I know that your intentions are good. You are a moral
                            man, and I know that there are things that you cannot control, just as
                            there are things we cannot control here. Our people are reading the
                            Congressional Record.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, I should like to request your authorization to
                            make your letter<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">See <ref target="#d158"

                            problem and of helping the people of Panama.</p>

                            have said and I understand the reasons for your concern. But what must
                            be assessed is the final language of the treaties. The <persName

                            official interpretation. For example, Senator <persName

                            Senate, has made a statement placing a different interpretation and

                                must be considered as a restatement and an elaboration of the

                                the Neutrality Treaty and therefore deemed it acceptable and worthy

                            and the Government of Panama.</p>
                        <p>The main point is that we must wait until the end to see how the whole
                            thing fits together. At that point I am certain that both you and I will
                            then see that the actions of the Senate will have been constructive and
                            adequate to alleviate all these concerns. For it is obvious that we have
                            no intention whatever of intervening in Panama, not in this century and
                            not in the next. The American Government and people have absolutely no
                            desire to do so. And this statement was reconfirmed by the 68 Senators
                            who voted yes last Thursday.<note n="7" xml:id="d159fn7">March

                            and me in order to defeat the treaties. Your advice to be calm and to
                            cause no disturbance was very sound advice<note n="8" xml:id="d159fn8"

                            been trying to follow here, matching what you have been doing in
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>You are most welcome to use my letter in any way you wish in order to
                            reconfirm our mutual respect for the Panamanian people and our firm
                            intention to honor the agreement reached between us and the provisions
                            of the treaties.</p>
                        <p>The friendship and mutual respect between the peoples of Panama and the
                            United States and the mutual trust between you and me are very strong
                            and sufficient to overcome any temporary disturbance, any speeches,
                            statements, or votes of individual Senators.</p>
                        <p>The main thing to remember is that I am following your advice to be calm
                            in order to be constructive. If you do the same, I am sure that the
                            final action taken by the Senate will lead to a good resolution of the
                            issues still pending regarding the treaties.</p>

                        <p>76845. Subject: Security of Outstanding Panamanian Bonds.</p>
                        <p>1. Continued failure of Panama to provide for future security of bonds
                            presently secured by payments under 1955 treaty creates a serious
                            political liability for Department in ongoing treaty debates. Although
                            the issue has not surfaced recently, it is unlikely to remain dormant.
                            If unresolved, this issue could jeopardize the vote of Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HW_1">Huddleston</persName> and eliminate any chance of
                            converting Senator <persName corresp="#p_FWH_1">Ford</persName>. Aside
                            from the specific interest of these Senators, Panama’s unwillingness to
                            commit itself on this question weakens the credibility of both the
                            Department and Panama in view of our January 30 letter to Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sparkman</persName>

                            support for treaty.</p>
                        <p>2. Department appreciates that Embassy has made determined and repeated
                            efforts to resolve this matter and that delay is due to dissension

                            on whether delivery by Ambassador of a formal note from Department
                            expressing concern over failure of <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                            to implement agreement in principle reached January 26 would facilitate

                                extended by Panama in the bond sales contracts of 1950, 1958, and
                                1962. <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> informed

                            the most difficult political issue he has ever faced, with the vote
                            still very close. We are determined, he said, that when the process is
                            completed there is no continuation of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> presence after this century and no insinuation of any

                            internal affairs. Some of the language of the reservations was
                            unfortunate, and we will make every effort to correct the mistakes in
                            the process of ratifying the second treaty.</p>

                            new spirit to inter-American relations which has been placed on his

                        <p>It is not feasible for domestic and international political reasons to
                            single out Panama for special treatment. Panama, however, is one of a
                            group of six countries (also Guyana, Jamaica, Colombia, Thailand, and
                            Taiwan) which, having lost <gloss target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss> on sugar
                            for competitive need reasons in 1976, were not redesignated for 1977 nor
                            again for 1978 although they were eligible in <hi rend="italic"
                                >both</hi> years. Within this group, moreover, <pb n="412"
                                facs="0447" xml:id="pg_412"/>Panama would be the most benefited—even
                            without <gloss target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss> last year its $22 million
                            of sugar exports to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> amounted to
                            45% of the six-country total.</p>
                        <p>The question of whether to redesignate any of the newly eligible
                            countries was considered by the interagency, STR-chaired Trade Policy
                            Staff Committee (TPSC) last month. Because sugar imports were deemed to
                            be a sensitive political matter, given the demands for higher domestic
                            sugar prices, the TPSC decided not to redesignate any of the eligible
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss> considers it highly unlikely that
                            redesignation of the six minor-supplier countries would engender any
                            adverse fallout on our <gloss target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss> program,
                            Congressional approval of the International Sugar Agreement or any other
                            national interest. These nations provide us with less than five percent
                            of our sugar imports and less than two percent of our annual sugar
                            supply. Domestic sugar prices would be unaffected by the action—a 2.8
                            cents a pound tariff on 300 thousand tons of imports would be lost to
                            the Treasury. The “competitive need” provision of our law would prevent
                            these countries from becoming long-term, large-scale suppliers of sugar
                            to us. What is insignificant to us, however, can be important for all
                            small countries. Sugar is a major foreign exchange earner and source of
                            employment for the Latin American eligibles.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> also favors the redesignation of
                            sugar for <gloss target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss> for Panama and the five
                            other countries. Agencies other than State represented on the TPSC (STR,
                            Agriculture, Treasury, Commerce and Labor), are less concerned about the
                            international relations aspect of not making any new designations, and
                            consider it better not to risk any adverse domestic interest group
                            reactions. Therefore, a Presidential decision will be required on the
                            basis of divided advice.</p>

                            atmosphere in the Congress regarding the problems of sugar. Farm
                            interests have pressed hard for tighter import controls including
                            quotas. Hawaiian cane growers and the corn industry have both joined in
                            support of the continuation of import restrictions.</p>

                        <p>Having come this far, it is ironic that we were almost de-railed last
                            week on a non-issue: the Senate being disturbed that the Panamanians
                            were upset by the <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1">DeConcini</persName>
                            reservation. The question is how do we get the Panamanians and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1">DeConcini</persName> people back on

                                “question is how do we” and “Panamanians and the <persName

                        <p>The problem last week stemmed from confusion and misunderstanding. We
                            need to begin by untangling this web.</p>
                        <p>The Senate thought that the Panamanians rejected the treaties. This is
                            untrue; the Panamanians are upset by the <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1"
                                >DeConcini</persName> reservation and fearful of future
                            reservations. To keep his government in tact, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> needs some language in the
                            new treaty, which makes a self-evident point: that the treaties are
                            consistent with the U.N. and O.A.S. Charter.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">

                        <p>I don’t think there are any Senators who voted for the Neutrality Treaty
                            who believe that their actions would violate the U.N. Charter. Indeed,
                            the leadership amendment restates the point which the President has
                            often made: that we have no intention or desire to interfere in the
                            internal affairs of Panama. The <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1"

                            along these lines for the President and mentioned the idea to

                        <p>We are in an extremely delicate position right now; we share a none too
                            steady ship, and there are many in the Senate and in Panama who are
                            eager to sink it. Regardless of who sinks it, the President will be hurt
                            very badly if the ship goes down. Therefore, we need to be sufficiently
                            sensitive to the concerns of the Panamanians to keep them on our side. A
                            statement along the lines of the Q&amp;A would probably do the trick,
                            but the President should probably call <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1"

                        <p>For our Ambassadors’ guidance, we noted the following points of
                            significance in the above provision: First, the opening phrase is a
                            strong affirmation of the principle of non-intervention. Second, this
                            language spans both treaties and all reservations, conditions, and
                            understandings. Third, the text limits <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> action to the affirmative purposes of assuring that
                            the canal remains open, secure and accessible. Fourth, the text
                            explicitly denies that any action we might take under the treaties would

                        </opener>
                        <p>A few moments ago the Senate of the United States accorded its consent to
                            the second of the two Panama Canal Treaties you and I signed here in
                            Washington last September.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">The Senate
                                approved the Panama Canal Treaty with a vote of 68–32.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ratification of the new Treaties will open a new era in the relationship
                            of the United States, not merely with Panama but with all the nations of
                            the Hemisphere. Working together, our two countries can provide an
                            example and an incentive to others, in the Americas and beyond, for fair
                            and constructive international cooperation in the pursuit of common
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>Precisely because these Treaties are so important to our two countries,
                            their negotiation and approval has been difficult and time-consuming.
                            The debate in our Senate has been the most extensive ever conducted on
                            any treaty in the history of the United States. As you know, it has been
                            vigorous. The Treaties have raised difficult and emotional issues in our
                            nation, going far beyond the Canal and our ties with Panama. Just as in
                            your country, patriotic men of good will have had sharply differing
                            views, as they will whenever fair compromises are struck to advance a
                            greater common interest.</p>
                        <p>The patience and patriotism of the people of Panama in this long process
                            have been impressive and have earned for them the respect of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>There have been times in these past months when the outcome was
                            uncertain, and when doubts arose as to whether we would be able to
                            ratify the two accords. For our part, these doubts have now been set at
                            rest. Through its action today, the Senate has reaffirmed what was
                            central to the treaties from the outset: that the United States, while
                            safeguarding its vital interest in a secure, open and accessible Canal,
                                <pb n="422" facs="0457" xml:id="pg_422"/>does not intend to
                            intervene in the internal affairs of Panama, its government, its public
                            policy, or its cultural integrity, or in any way to impair its sovereign
                            integrity or political independence.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">In

                        <p>These are principles that we as a nation have long cherished. We have
                            observed them in our relations with the other American Republics since
                            President Roosevelt first proclaimed our adherence to the Doctrine of
                            non-intervention in 1933. They are enshrined as international law in the
                            Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
                            It is therefore fitting that these principles—and particularly that no
                            nation has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of
                            another—should be embraced in the Treaties and their accompanying
                            documents, including the Senate Resolutions. When we meet to exchange
                            the instruments of ratification, we can reaffirm that this principle of
                            non-intervention is clearly accepted by both our countries.<note n="4"

                            <p>Through <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> we are now completing
                                inter-agency clearance of the draft legislation. We must consult the
                                Congressional leadership on the timing of formal submission: the
                                House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee is anxious to begin
                                hearings soon. We expect the legislation to be considered by perhaps
                                four committees in each House before enactment, next year. When we
                                resubmit the legislation to the new Congress, we hope to arrange a
                                time agreement with the leadership for early completion of
                                Congressional action.</p>

                                use our best efforts to make available to Panama up to $295 million
                                over five years in loans and guarantees for economic assistance
                                purposes, and up to $50 million in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"

                                would be helpful in coping with Panama’s depressed economic

                                    >Document 188</ref>.</note> The central issue is whether any
                            department would be designated a lead agency, and if so, which one.</p>
                        <p>I have spoken to you about this issue before, and the position I have

                            taking is the following: that we should go to Congress requesting
                            Presidential discretion to designate which ever agency he believes is
                            most appropriate. If Congress demands that we designate an agency, then
                            we should choose the Department of Transportation. If Congress pushes us
                            to accept the Defense Department as the lead agency, then we should
                            defer to Congress’ will, making clear that Congress has improved the
                            legislation. I think this strategy would be helpful in getting
                            implementing legislation passed, and the Congressional people with whom
                            I have talked, agree.</p>

                        <p>—The Panamanian Negotiating Team has transitioned successfully to the
                            implementation planning stage. A detailed briefing by the Planning Group
                            revealed that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is in the process
                            of establishing an autonomous Government agency to assume control of all
                            treaty implementation matters. It will provide the Panamanian
                            representatives to all treaty-related boards and committees and will
                            coordinate all actions taken by Panamanian Government agencies. Several

                            representatives of this agency have already occurred.</p>
                        <p>—It is clear that the principle impact of the Senate debate in Panama has

                            political but did identify two weaknesses and potential problem

                        <p>During our luncheon meeting on 24 March 1978 the Secretary of State and I
                            discussed the authority of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            Ambassador to Panama as it relates to the Panama Canal Commission
                                (<gloss target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2"

                            In the initial draft of the implementing legislation, State proposed
                            that the Ambassador have complete authority over the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss>. Defense recommended that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss> Administrator be placed in the same
                            category as the area military commander (exempt from authority of the
                            Ambassador) and that the Ambassador, the <gloss target="#t_PCC_1"
                                >PCC</gloss> Administrator and the area military commander be
                            required to keep each other fully informed and to cooperate and
                            coordinate on matters of mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense recognizes that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Ambassador to Panama will be concerned with certain
                            issues affecting the Canal. We believe the Ambassador’s need for early
                            information and adequate opportunity to consider implications for the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian relationship can be
                            met by effective coordination in Panama, by having the Ambassador
                            present and participating as an advisor at <gloss target="#t_PCC_1"
                                >PCC</gloss> Board meetings and by continued participation of the
                            Ambassador and his staff in the Panama Review Committee, an in-country
                            vehicle for interchange of information and views between <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> agencies. This will provide the
                            Ambassador with a voice at <gloss target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss> Board
                            meetings and timely information so that he can weigh in at the local or
                            Washington level through his chain of command. A Foreign Service Officer
                            could also be assigned to the <gloss target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss>
                            staff, on a reimbursable basis, to provide political advice.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense does not believe that it is necessary, or wise,
                            for the Ambassador to exercise authority over the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss>. Although the Ambassador normally
                            would not want to interfere in Canal operations, the possibility that he
                            might use this authority would create a dichotomy between policy and
                            operations that would hinder the <gloss target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss>
                            management in carrying out its assigned mission.</p>
                        <pb n="431" facs="0466" xml:id="pg_431"/>
                        <p>I believe strongly that the operation and defense of the Canal must be
                            managed centrally under the aegis of one agency. We assume that as the
                            result of an ongoing <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> study the
                            President will assign oversight of the Panama Canal Commission to the
                            Secretary of the Army acting through the Secretary of Defense. The
                            Ambassador does not belong in what would then be a Department of Defense
                            chain of command.<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">An unknown hand underlined
                                the last two sentences.</note> Giving the Ambassador final authority
                            within country would, I believe, also undermine our present position
                            with the Congress, by implying that the Executive Branch was willing to
                            subordinate <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> interests in the
                            operation and defense of the Canal to the vagaries of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian political relations.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, the agreement reached at our meeting with Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> on 24 March provided
                            for placing the <gloss target="#t_PCC_1">PCC</gloss> Administrator in
                            the same category as the area military commander (i.e., reporting in my
                            channel) is the best solution. Proposed language was agreed upon
                            subsequently by the State and Defense Department staffs and included in
                            the legislative package forwarded to Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BEW_1">Brooke</persName> and other Senators on 28 March
                            1978.</p>
                        <p>Recent reports indicate that staff personnel of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and Embassy Panama are now attempting
                            to reverse the Ambassadorial powers decision.<note n="4"

                            I object strongly to these attempts to circumvent the agreement reached
                            previously, and request that you intercede with the Office of Management
                            and Budget to ensure that the legislation forwarded to the Congress will

                            the following main points of discussion ensued:</p>
                        <p>a. Any efforts on both our parts directed towards the betterment of
                            relations, development of combined defense concepts and/or training
                            programs incident thereto will have to be a graduated effort done in
                            stages little by little. One of the first areas that <gloss
                                target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> indicated should be his
                            primary concern is that of helping the <gloss target="#t_GN_1"
                                >GN</gloss> and the Panamanian people eliminate their
                            anti-imperialist attitudes. He said that he hoped that such change would
                            eventually become a spontaneous enthusiasm rather than a forced
                            enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>b. His second point was that any effort should be held in abeyance until
                            after President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s visit
                            in June.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">See <ref target="#d183">Documents
                                    183</ref> and <ref target="#d185">185</ref>.</note> All the
                            treaty efforts to date have built up like a crescendo that will be
                            capped by President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                            visit and the accompanying exchange of ratification documents. After all
                            the excitement dies down, cooperative activities can begin to take
                            place. Such activities should be open (as opposed to secret), but not
                            ostentatious or clamorous (ruidoso).</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> alluded to the fact
                            that Americans do things very rapidly (“you move at six miles per hour”)
                            and that the Panamanians were a lot slower. The emphasis was made here
                            that we would both have to go forward together (in parallel), even if it
                            meant slowing down to “three <gloss target="#t_MPH_1">MPH</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>d. Civilians should be kept informed matter-of-factly of all the combined
                            efforts engaged in by both the <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_USSOUTHCOM_1">USSOUTHCOM</gloss>
                            <pb n="433" facs="0468" xml:id="pg_433"/>elements so that the
                            people—both Panamanian and American (Zonian)—can see that the real
                            spirit of cooperation exists and is working.</p>
                        <p>e. The first echelon (priority) would be to establish the evident
                            visibility of the <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> in the “maintenance
                            of public order” role. This position, he said would be the first echelon
                            and that it was a necessary one to put the <gloss target="#t_GN_1"
                                >GN</gloss> in the position of maintaining order over all Panamanian
                            territory, especially when there was a problem between Panamanian and
                            American citizens. He discussed this from a juridical or legal point of
                            view and said that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Noriega</persName> is working on the plans.</p>
                        <p>f. The second echelon (priority) as described by <gloss target="#t_BG_1"
                                >BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, which would follow the
                            “maintenance of public order” steps described above, is the development
                            of defense considerations. Responsibilities for the development of basic
                            plans for defense should be shared and coordinated. Again he mentioned
                            the need to go slowly and without fanfare.</p>
                        <p>g. Any changes that occur as a matter of transition from one government
                            to another or from one policy to another should be a logical progression
                            of small changes until the entire big change had been effected. Again
                                <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> emphasized the need for
                            a step-by-step approach to any changes to the status quo.</p>
                        <p>h. The <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> must be the visible “front
                            line”, particularly along 4th of July Avenue. This was a reiteration of
                            a previous comment and appeared to be one of the thoughts foremost on
                                <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> mind.</p>
                        <p>i. What <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> then described was
                            essentially a commander’s estimate type of procedure whereby he
                            indicated that first we would have to identify the threat, then develop
                            the proper defensive tactic to counter the threat to include an analysis
                            of all the advantages and disadvantages for both sides with respect to
                            each threat and selected defensive tactic. This was to be done in order
                            of priority, according to the seriousness of the threat. He specifically
                            mentioned disorders, sabotage, and guerrilla action, as well as “higher
                            levels of threat.” One of his main preoccupations was the question of
                            the integration of defensive concepts. He recognized the need for
                            classified defense plans but that their development should be open and
                            above board. The public would be informed that plans were being
                            developed but that the specific content would not be divulged to
                            unauthorized persons.</p>
                        <p>j. Finally <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> discussed the impending
                            visit of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. He
                            said that he strongly recommended that the President not just visit
                            Panama for the purpose of exchanging protocols of ratification nor that
                            he just fly to the locks and then out as if he were a “thief in the
                            night”; but rather should enter the Zone (as if triumphantly) “through
                            the main entrance rather than through the kitchen door.” <gloss
                                target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> indicated that he felt
                            that by not visiting with the Americans in the “Zone” the Americans here
                            might feel betrayed, and that they <pb n="434" facs="0469"
                                xml:id="pg_434"/>should have an opportunity to see and cheer their
                            President. He scoffed at the idea that there would be any danger to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>2. As the group rose to leave, <gloss target="#t_BG_1">BG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> indicated that he would
                            respond soon to the <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss>’s letter.
                            (After he had first read the <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss>’s
                            letter he asked if there would be any problems in making it public. He
                            was told that there would be no problem.)</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Your letter is most generous,<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">Not
                                found.</note> and I am touched by the warm feeling of friendship
                            between us which it expresses.</p>
                        <p>Together we have reached a new era in the relationship between our two
                            nations. It has not been an easy achievement for either country, but the
                            result was worth the effort; and in the long and trying days that
                            brought us to this moment, the Panamanian people and their leaders won
                            our respect for their goodwill, courage and clear sense of national
                            destiny. This mutual respect between a large country and a small one,
                            earned in a severe test, should give us confidence about the strength
                            and durability of the relationship we have formed. Working together, we
                            have given others reason to hope that they can find common ground in the
                            pursuit of national goals. As the President of Panama, you may justly
                            take pride in your country’s fulfillment of its aspirations of many
                            decades.</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to seeing you in Panama to celebrate this

                            Panamanian participation in the non-aligned movement and he said that
                            Panama’s <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Ambassador would probably

                            him on the Cuban situation in Africa and suggested that he convey this

                            Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> said that he

                            should indeed play a more vocal role in bringing this issue to the fore.
                            He asked if I would talk to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"

                        <p>1. A memorandum from Deputy Defense Secretary <persName

                            for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> dated May 9 has come to my attention.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">See <ref target="#d173">Document
                                173</ref>.</note> The main thrust of it is that a decision to exempt
                            the Panama Canal Commission from the Ambassador’s authority has been
                            made by the Departments of State and Defense and that certain government
                            officials, including personnel of this Embassy, <pb n="437" facs="0472"
                                xml:id="pg_437"/>are attempting to reverse that decision. I have
                            some problems with that memorandum.</p>
                        <p>2. In the first place, I am the Ambassador of the United States—not the
                            Ambassador of the State Department—in Panama. And as the President’s
                            representative in this country, it is my responsibility to advise him on
                            matters concerning our policies relating to it. Similarly, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                                >OMB</gloss> have a responsibility to render independent judgements.
                            I understand that an agreement was reached between the Departments of
                            State and Defense on this policy matter. In my judgment, it is a bad
                            agreement. I presume the President will make a final decision on a
                            policy exception of this magnitude, and I hope my views will be
                            available to him before he does so.</p>
                        <p>3. Second, this Embassy has not been trying to “circumvent the
                            agreement,” but rather to make certain that the President is aware of
                            the viewpoint of his Ambassador in this country before his final
                            decision on a precedent-breaking foreign policy question. The last
                            paragraph of the memorandum suggests that unidentified “staff personnel”
                            of the Embassy have been a source in this effort of “circumvention.” I
                            am responsible for making our views on this subject known; it has been
                            done at my specific instructions.</p>
                        <p>4. I have, on several occasions, expressed my views on this matter to the
                            Department of State, my normal and proper channel for such
                            communications. I see no need to repeat those views at length here, but
                            I would like to comment briefly on several matters raised by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName>’s memorandum.</p>
                        <p>5. His argument that the entire canal operation should be in an
                            operational-military-type chain of command is unpersuasive to me. Canal
                            operation, and the Canal Commission, are civilian, not military,
                            activities. All other civil agencies, including extremely sensitive ones
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] operate
                            under the Ambassador’s statutory authority in every country in the
                            world. There are no exceptions.<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">An unknown
                                hand underlined this sentence.</note> The same is increasingly true
                            even of overseas Defense Department military operations not parts of an
                            operational force under area command, e.g., <gloss target="#t_MAAG_1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>’s, MilGroups and security assistance activities. This
                            system has worked quite well. Recent Presidential and congressional
                            actions have moved in the direction of strengthening, not diluting,
                                it.<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">An unknown hand underlined this
                                sentence.</note> The principle of agency authority over overseas
                            operations has nevertheless not been compromised; no one else seems to
                            be complaining. American operations overseas have generally been
                            responsive to our overall national foreign policy interests as they
                            relate to each country. I have explained <pb n="438" facs="0473"
                                xml:id="pg_438"/>several times—most recently in Panama 3327<note

                                Embassy’s role in treaty implementation and requested additional

                            exception.</p>
                        <p>6. A second premise of the memorandum is that leaving the law as it now
                            stands would imply “that the executive branch was willing to subordinate
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in the operation and
                            defense of the canal to the vagaries of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian political relations.” I fail to see how any
                            such inference can be drawn. Whether we like it or not, the very real
                            fact is that as of October 1, 1979, the Panama Canal will be operating
                            in a foreign country. It can no more be operated unilaterally, without
                            regard to the host country,<note n="6" xml:id="d177fn6">An unknown hand

                            to underlie both the memorandum and the change in policy and law which
                            it advocates—will itself be one of our major problems in protecting our
                            interest in the canal operation.<note n="8" xml:id="d177fn8">An unknown

                        </p>
                        <p>7. Let us be clear about one thing. We are begin underline not end

                            underline talking about is assuring that the operations of an agency of
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government in a foreign country

                            problems that inevitably will arise will be settled quietly and
                            effectively on the scene by those who know most about them, i.e., here
                            in Panama.</p>
                        <p>8. The worst thing about trying to curtail the Ambassador’s authority
                            over the commission is that it simply will not work. Panama has the
                            power to raise questions with the Ambassador, and is extremely likely to
                            do so. The initiative on what questions those are will belong to Panama,
                            no matter what <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> laws we try to pass
                            about it.<note n="10" xml:id="d177fn10">An unknown hand highlighted

                            such a shell-game, we will find that it will not succeed in the new
                            situation. And the canal operation that is our national interest to
                            protect will be the only real loser from it.</p>

                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> is coordinating a paper which it
                            intends to send to the President very soon on the Canal implementing
                            legislation. There are only a few issues on which the Agencies did not
                            reach agreement, but these have become rather controversial, with <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> vehemently arguing its point, usually
                            alone. You have already made a decision on the central issue (I attach
                            that memo at Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">Not attached. Tab A is
                                printed as <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note> but in the
                            light of a recent memo to you from <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Charles
                                Duncan</persName> (at Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">Not

                            opportunity to review that decision.</p>
                        <p>The question fundamentally is: which Agency should have primary
                            responsibility for running the Canal? A subsidiary question—whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Ambassador should have authority
                            over <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials in the Canal
                            Commission—was discussed at a meeting which you attended by Secretaries
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> apparently argued hard for
                            the independence of the Commission and, as the memo by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> suggests, assumed that <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> would control the Commission; and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> conceded that point.
                            Our Ambassador in Panama, <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Bill
                                Jorden</persName>, has just sent (at Tab C)<note n="5"

                            in which he argues—<pb n="440" facs="0475" xml:id="pg_440"/>to my mind,
                            persuasively—that the Ambassador needs to have the authority over the
                            Canal Commission, lest our broader national interests for a smooth and
                            cooperative transition be sacrificed by those (presumably in <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>) who are reluctant to accept a new
                            partnership.</p>
                        <p>Stimulated by this recent flurry of memoranda, I now believe more
                            strongly that <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> should maintain its
                            position (as stated in Tab A) that the President should be given
                            discretionary authority, but first choice for lead agency should be the
                            Department of Transportation. <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>
                            agrees with our position. State is “inclined to favor” <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> oversight, but believes <gloss

                        <p>A second issue is whether the five <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            seats on the Board of Directors should be composed of senior officials
                            from the five primarily interested agencies (<gloss target="#t_DOT_1"

                            except <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> support the former—that the
                            seats be given to the five agencies—and I recommend that you support

                        <p>I have been able to establish a good rapport with <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, and he was extremely

                            requests.</p>
                        <p>—He accepted with good grace the fact that the President has a limited
                            amount of time during his trip to Panama,<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4"
                                >See <ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note> and said he
                            would not press his schedule preference. (We are not going to Cantadora
                            or to his home village, Santiago, as he had requested. [<hi
                                rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] at hearing that the
                            President would not go to Santiago. He therefore went a long way in one
                            day.)</p>
                        <p>—He said he understood the political sensitivity in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> during the next year or two while
                            implementing legislation is considered, and that he would therefore not
                            move rapidly to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviets as he
                            had originally planned. He also backed away from his request to begin
                            construction immediately of a container port in the Zone for the same
                            reason.</p>
                        <p>—He not only enthusiastically approved of the idea of issuing a
                            multilateral Declaration of Panama along the lines which I described,
                                <pb n="442" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_442"/>but he said that his
                            Foreign Minister would make our draft Panama’s draft and carry it to the
                            various capitals. (The Presidents of Venezuela, Colombia, Costa Rica are
                            definitely coming, and we also expect Jamaica and Mexico to attend.)</p>
                        <p>—This is all insignificant, however, compared to the distance he traveled
                            in our discussion on Cuba and the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>.
                            I pressed him very hard, appealing to his idealism and to his (and our)
                            concern with the principles of non-intervention and non-alignment. I
                            told him that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> wanted a strong
                            and independent non-aligned movement; we didn’t mind occasional
                            criticism of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> provided it was
                            balanced and that we weren’t the only power criticized. Is the Soviet
                            Union or Cuba so pure, I asked, that they can be free of criticism from
                            the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>? I repeatedly hammered him with
                            questions like, How can the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> permit
                            Cuba to be a member when it is so obviously aligned with the
                            Soviets?</p>
                        <p>He tried to laugh it off by saying that our “pride was hurt more than
                            your security,” and then suggesting that Latin Americans don’t mind as
                            long as Cuban troops were outside of Latin America. He accepted my
                            response that if you don’t voice your concern about Cubans in Africa,
                            you will be too late and too weak when they turn to Belize or
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me to accompany him alone for a trip by jeep through the
                            farming community. We spoke for about an hour. He began by asking
                            whether there was anything that I wanted to say to him privately, and I
                            decided to pursue the Cuba subject, only by appealing even more to him
                            as a person who had influence with <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Castro</persName> and a person whose ideals couldn’t permit a
                            double standard. I waxed with thick praise, and it worked. He opened
                            up.</p>
                        <p>He said that he communicated often with <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Castro</persName>, and he had already stated his concern in general
                            terms. In the light of our conversation, he now intended to be more
                            forceful, especially when he visits the Non-Aligned Summit in Havana
                            next year. He admitted that he and other Latins had been hypocritical in
                            their silence on this issue. He asked whether we had been briefing other
                            Latin governments as I was doing with him, and whether <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> policy to the non-aligned had really
                            changed, because prior to my remarks he had not seen any evidence of
                            change. He said he felt reasonably certain that Venezuela, Costa Rica,
                            and Colombia, for example, were not aware that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> no longer “frowned” on the <gloss

                        <p>The Panama Government, and especially <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>, have very good lines of intelligence running
                            to Cuba (and Cuba, I suspect, into Panama), and <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> volunteered some information.
                            He said he had indications that <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Castro</persName> had increasing problems with the Army General
                            Staff, who <pb n="443" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_443"/>are extremely
                            concerned about the morale problems of the Cuban troops. “The problem
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName>,” <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said, “is that he was a
                            revolutionary, and he doesn’t understand the mentality of the people
                            (soldiers) who live in the barracks.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that he thinks
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> has made a disastrous
                            mistake by going into Africa; the continent had swallowed up other
                            imperial efforts before. He feels that in the long term Cuba will not
                            have had any significant impact on Africa, but that the African
                            experience will significantly affect Cuba. The longer <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> stays in Africa, the more
                            vulnerable he will become in Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> doesn’t doubt that <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Castro</persName> is firmly in charge right now, but he does
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName>’s decision
                            was his Rubicon, and that it was a “mistake,” and one <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> will live to regret.</p>
                        <p>He surprised me by saying that if the other leaders coming to Panama
                            agreed to condemn Cuba in the Declaration, he too would sign the
                            Declaration. (I am following up on this.)</p>
                        <p>After our meeting, his Foreign Minister requested some background papers
                            on Cuba in advance of his trip to the Belgrade Conference in July. I
                            believe that a short briefing by you for him during the President’s trip
                            would reap significant dividends. Shall I mention to him that you will
                            try to brief him during the trip, and try to set it up?<note n="5"

                            the National Assembly in October.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Run for President.</hi> He would probably win

                                control of the Guard.</hi> He expressed repeated concern about those

                            Arias, the President whom <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> deposed in 1968 and who is returning to Panama
                            a week before the President. (Arias clearly worries <persName

                            seems more interested now in preserving the gains of his development
                            efforts than in striking out with new initiatives, and so it’s possible
                            that the third option is good for all, but in my private and casual
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis</persName>
                            and Panama’s Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_GN_1"

                            wreak havoc in the routine governmental policy-making—as he does now—if

                            dramatic expansion of the government budget, and its reorientation from
                            serving the wealthy in the city to serving poor people, in the rural
                            area, with particular and special emphasis on education. In his
                            inimitable way, he told me: “I have replaced the traditional <hi

                            the beginning and the heart of any genuine social change. And he means
                            it: rural education has increased its share of government expenditures
                            under Torrijos.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was full of praise for
                            the President, saying that he had given the poor and unrepresented in

                            America, in Torrijos’ (and my) opinion, is his idealism, which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has so successfully projected.
                            He said that there are groups in Latin America who have long been
                            anti-American, but they are now prepared to cross this ideological
                            divide if <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> were to quietly
                            reach out to them. I think this is an interesting idea with important
                            geo-political implications and will try to send you a memo on it

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The trip was enormously useful, but the one thing which was continuously
                            impressed on me and which I find troubling is what a poor job we have
                            done in getting the President’s message out on a continuous basis—not
                            just by trips of high officials to our Embassies. I was amazed to hear
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VVP_1">Vaky</persName> did not receive any
                            information from us on the Dominican elections until a week ago, even
                            though it is such an important issue to <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1"
                                >Perez</persName> and also to us. Because we have failed to keep our
                            Ambassadors informed on a wide range of issues of great importance to
                            us, we have lost invaluable opportunities to achieve our objectives. It
                            is troubling that no one has briefed <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> on our views on Cuba’s role in Africa and our
                            views on the Non-Aligned Movement, in spite of Torrijos’ obvious
                            interest in both; that <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName> has
                            been briefed only twice on Africa—by the President and by the
                            President’s letter; that we have never touched base with Colombia,
                            Argentina, Peru and Guyana—all countries whose voices in the G–77 on
                            international issues count. We need to do something about this, and the
                            President’s trip to Panama is a good place to start. It’s important that
                            he re-states how much we value these countries as important actors in
                            international affairs.</p>

                            without an act of Congress. A similar House amendment prohibits
                            expenditure of State Department funds for Treaty implementation without
                            specific Congressional authorization. In addition, the first
                            Congressional Concurrent Resolution on the Budget declared the intent of
                            the Congress to terminate the Canal Company’s status as a government
                            corporation, and to establish it as an agency subject to annual
                            Congressional appropriations.</p>
                        <p>If these restrictions on Executive action were enacted into law, they

                            implementation; raise costs; jeopardize the Canal’s management; and
                            conceivably force us to delay steps in implementing the Treaties.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you recall, we discussed at lunch yesterday two issues arising out of
                            the Panama Canal treaties which had previously been agreed upon by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and myself but
                            which the bureaucratic process has kept open for the President’s
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The first issue concerns whether the Secretary of the Army, acting under
                            the Secretary of Defense, should have oversight responsibility for <pb
                                n="447" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_447"/>the Panama Canal or whether
                            instead the Department of Transportation should have that
                            responsibility. State and Defense, as well as the Department of
                            Commerce, agree that this responsibility should be continued in the
                            Department of Defense where it has been for the duration of the Canal’s
                            existence. Indeed, until this issue was recently raised, both Defense
                            and State have been operating on the premise that the Canal would be a
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> responsibility. That assumption
                            was conveyed on numerous occasions to the Congress in the course of the
                            debate surrounding ratification.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">An unknown
                                hand underlined this sentence.</note> To change course now would put
                            the treaty implementing legislation at serious risk and would
                            substantially add to the managerial problems of integrating the Canal’s
                            operation and its defense.</p>
                        <p>The second issue concerns the authority of the Ambassador over the Panama
                            Canal Commission. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> and I have long agreed that, even though the
                            Ambassador has a legitimate interest in how the Canal is operated, he
                            should not have operational responsibility over the Panama Canal
                            Commission. Here too the Congress was led to believe during the
                            ratification process that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> would not
                            only have oversight responsibility over the Canal Commission but also
                            operational control.</p>
                        <p>I expect you will be able to take appropriate steps to see that these
                            joint views of the Departments of State and Defense are brought to the
                            attention of the President if that is necessary.</p>

                        <p>On June 10, Arnulfo Arias, three times elected President and thrice
                            deposed, returned to Panama, and before nearly 100,000 people, he gave a
                            hard-driving campaign-like speech in which he directly insulted
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and his government
                            in the most provocative way. Though 77 years old, Arias is said to still
                            possess the charisma and forcefulness which made him a Panamanian
                            equivalent of Juan Peron. He is a populist of the far right.</p>
                        <p>Since 1968, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has mostly
                            feared the left in Panama, and his rhetoric reflects that. The return of
                            Arias alone has changed the political <pb n="450" facs="0485"
                                xml:id="pg_450"/>spectrum, forcing <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> to admit recently that his greatest fear is
                            from the right, from “those in the National Guard”, in his words, “who
                            still want to serve the oligarchy”.</p>
                        <p>Within a day of his return, Arias sent one of his confidants to negotiate
                            the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> with
                                <gloss target="#t_COL_1">Col</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Noriega</persName>, Panama’s Intelligence Chief. Our judgment is
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Noriega</persName> reported the contact
                            immediately to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, and
                            since Arias must have been aware of the great risk of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Noriega</persName> telling <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, one has to conclude that
                            Arias is trying to deliberately provoke Torrijos. Our intelligence
                            suggests that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Noriega</persName> do not want to do
                            anything which detracts from your receiving the warmest welcome in
                            Panamanian history, and so we expect that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> will try to overlook all but the most flagrant
                            and dangerous transgressions. It is not clear how far Arias will go this
                            week towards his goal of re-assuming power. Arias has told us that he
                            also does not want to spoil your visit, but he is less trustworthy.</p>
                        <p>In a word, you are arriving in a highly volatile political situation—the
                            first real test of Torrijos’ control over the Guardia and the country
                            for nearly a decade. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            hopes that the trip will solidify his grip, and the opposition may
                            coalesce around Arias to try to prevent that from happening. My guess is
                            that the situation in Panama will remain <hi rend="italic"
                                >relatively</hi> stable and quiet during your trip and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> will retain
                            considerable flexibility to define Panama’s future political system in
                            the months ahead.</p>

                            Panama’s politics, but to a certain extent, they are closely identified

                            Arias attacked the Treaties as a sell-out of Panama’s sovereign rights,
                            and said that it created a new source of friction between the <gloss

                            gentle nudge on your part would probably be acceptable and is likely to

                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> overthrew Arias in
                            1968, Panamanian politics was, to a large degree, a contest between
                            political parties representing the relatively narrow interest of the
                            oligarchy. <pb n="451" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_451"/>Government was
                            minimal and primarily oriented to serving Panama City. This partly
                            explains Torrijos’ extreme distaste for political parties. (Last year,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, in a typical
                            interview, said that while “it is not exactly correct that political
                            parties make me feel like vomiting [as the press had quoted him],
                            decisions on the country’s fate should not be confused with the private
                            interests of these groups.”)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> rather dramatically
                            shifted the government from serving Panama City to serving the rural
                            areas and placed greatest emphasis on education, health services, and
                            agrarian reform. His Finance Minister, <persName corresp="#p_BNA_1"
                                >Barletta</persName>, has also undertaken a number of expensive
                            investment projects, including a large hydro-electric project which will
                            open up much of southern Panama to new cultivation. These investments

                        <p>On the eve of your trip, <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName>’s “sense of apprehension” is predictable, but not
                            justified by the facts.</p>
                        <p>He is concerned that Panama’s Foreign Ministry Communique and its
                            instrument of ratification circumvent the letter and the spirit of the
                            Senate’s Treaty. This is not true.</p>
                        <p>First of all, the Communique is a statement of the government, but not
                            legally binding like a treaty. Secondly, while it clearly expresses
                            concern with certain reservations—notably <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1"
                                >DeConcini</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NSJ_1"
                                >Nunn</persName>—it does not repudiate or reject anything in the
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Panama’s instrument of ratification, it contains two
                            understandings and a declaration. The first Panamanian understanding
                            reaffirms the commitments of both countries to certain provisions
                            regarding non-intervention contained in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> and O.A.S. charters. The second provides that action to
                            maintain the Neutrality Treaty be <pb n="453" facs="0488"
                                xml:id="pg_453"/>done in a manner consistent with the “principles of
                            mutual respect and cooperation.”</p>
                        <p>The declaration states that Panama’s independence is “guaranteed by the
                            unshakeable will of the Panamanian people,” who will reject any attempt
                            at intervening in their internal affairs. We do not have any problems
                            with these, and State has reviewed them with the Senate leadership, who
                            also accepts them.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> makes three
                            requests:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">That you make the instruments of ratification
                                public immediately</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren

                            and the Panamanians prefer it like that. If you decide to release them
                            immediately, we need to coordinate it with the Panamanians first, and
                            they may be a little suspicious of our trying to move the timing
                            forward. If we release the documents immediately, it is likely to
                            generate some controversy in the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            and Panama and provide more time for the opposition to try to halt the
                            trip.</p>
                        <p>Should we release them on Thursday after consulting with the

                        <p>The months between our Treaty signing ceremonies last September in
                            Washington and the ceremony in Panama City were long and difficult. But
                            during those months the people of Panama and the Senate of the United
                            States demonstrated their approval of the Treaties. I know that our
                            shared endeavors during this time made the exchange ceremony yesterday
                            that much more meaningful for us both. I have no doubt that it truly
                            marks the beginning of a new and more promising era in relations between
                            our two nations, and among all the nations of the Hemisphere.</p>

                            appreciation for the hospitality they have extended to us. We were
                            warmed by our welcome and all that you did to make our visit the success

                            be abolished and a new agency, the Panama Canal Commission, created.
                            Under the supervision of a Board consisting of five United States and
                            four Panamanian nationals, the Commission will be responsible for
                            managing, operating, and maintaining the Canal. The Commission will
                            operate, with substantial Panamanian participation, in territory under
                            the plenary jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama (although the
                            Commission itself will be immune from Panamanian jurisdiction).</p>

                            continuity, while Transportation claims that the Canal is primarily a

                            the Treaty require a change in agency oversight. There are some concerns
                            that moving responsibility to Transportation will upset the Senate Armed
                            Services Committee, which will consider legislation implementing the

                            Administrator, who is the American most visible to the Panamanians,
                            henceforth should be a civilian rather than a military person and that
                            at the first opportunity after the 30-month transition period,
                            consideration should be given to moving oversight responsibility to

                            Nationality Act and that they be exempted from the restrictions in that

                            the immigration law would set an undesirable precedent and ought not to

                        <p>They were obviously “happy”; after reflecting on the conversation, I

                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had spoken with

                            about the recent change in Honduras, and CAP had authorized <persName

                            recommend to the Hondurans that they include three more colonels in the
                            new junta. The names of the colonels were: van Seca, Maldonado, and
                            Suarez. He said that CAP and he were concerned that the junta had
                            shifted to the right (our intelligence reports have the same
                            assessment), and they wanted to include these three in the junta so as
                            to make the government a little bit more progressive.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to them that the communique issued by the Honduran Superior
                            Defense Council had stated that the new government would continue the
                            same “progressive policy” on land reform and other social issues as the
                            previous government. They answered that was true, but “it still depends
                            on the people who will be implementing the policies.” I asked if they
                            would convey this recommendation privately or publicly, and they said
                            they would do it privately.</p>
                        <p>They then said they would “speak for the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss>” as well, and I asked them if they had spoken to any
                            high American official and been <pb n="467" facs="0502" xml:id="pg_467"
                            />authorized to do that. I said with great seriousness that they in no
                            way should construe this conversation as giving them any authority to
                            speak on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> because I
                            could not authorize such a statement. And frankly, I told them I would
                            not recommend it since I didn’t think it was such a good idea.</p>
                        <p>I asked them when they intended to place the call, and they laughed and
                            said, “Already done”. I said uneasily that they shouldn’t have spoken
                            for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>, and they then backed off a
                            bit, and said that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> had
                            told the Hondurans that he thought that the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> “would look on [the recommendation] with good

                            not let it appear that they are following a crowd, but they will before

                            Canal Treaty implementation process.</p>
                        <p>As you know, in the months which have passed since the Treaties were
                            approved and instruments of ratification exchanged, representatives of
                            our two Governments have met in Panama and begun to plan for the
                            Treaties’ entry into force. Now, our representatives have agreed that
                            the time has come to make a general assessment of those steps which have
                            been taken and those which must be taken in the months ahead to ensure
                            that the Treaty implementation process continues to proceed smoothly. To
                            that end, General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> and

                            during the negotiations had been very positive; that we knew him as a
                            pragmatic, flexible and honest negotiator. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> wanted us to know that he was a friend of the

                            was following his advice to make overtures to the private sector. He
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> had asked him to
                            become Minister of Commerce, but that he was not interested in joining
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>I said that we had noted <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>’s
                            speeches in Panama emphasizing the importance of the private sector and
                            that such a policy, if translated into action, would obviously be
                            welcome in this country. I said that at some point it would be useful
                            for <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> to meet with
                            representatives of American business in this country and assure them of
                            his government’s interest in creating a favorable climate for private

                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> said that <persName

                            intends to leave his active involvement in the government and occupy
                            himself solely with the National Guard. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> added that he wanted to clean up the corruption
                            which existed in the Guard. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> expressed considerable skepticism about Torrijos’
                            true intentions, however, and said that Tor<pb n="472" facs="0507"

                            as wanting some sort of “larger role” in Latin American politics and
                            said that he was very much like a movie star who, having made one film,
                            now wants to make another.</p>

                                >Torrijos</persName> and the group. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> said that he saw Pastora and “Commandantes Uno”
                            and “Dos” at Torrijos’ house in Farallon earlier this month but was not
                            involved in any detailed discussions with them beyond simply hearing
                            their description of how they had managed their seizure of the National
                            Palace in Managua. I emphasized that it was very important in our view
                            that Panama not be used in any way as a base of operations of the
                            Sandinistas or even present the appearance of being involved in the
                            matter. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> agreed and said
                            that he did not know of any specific actions being taken by Panama at
                            this time, while adding that “everybody knew” that the Sandinistas were
                            being supplied with arms by Venezuela and that they were operating
                            freely across the Costa Rican border.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> said that he knew

                            that he was respected by <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName>,

                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> said that he felt it

                            the scene while a moderate solution for Nicaragua was still possible,
                            but that he doubted <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName> could
                            be persuaded to do so.</p>

                                Gonzalez</persName> were also present. In discursive session lasting

                            tone was one of satisfaction with progress thus far, but realization
                            that the hardest implementation problems still lay ahead.</p>
                        <p>2. Among points stressed were the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Importance of restraint in public utterances, and professed
                            determination to settle problems privately.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> view that when <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is represented on Canal Commission, it
                            will make innovative proposals such as incentive pay for pilots to
                            prevent ship backlogs (we pointed out that pilot performance was not the
                            problem).</p>
                        <p>C. Continued pressure by Panama for help to <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss> through advance preparations for treaty day transfers
                            (we explained care we must take to avoid “pre-implementation”).</p>
                        <p>D. Necessarily slow progress in our legislative procedure, and
                            sensitivity of our Congress to all developments in Panama.</p>
                        <p>E. Our encouragement at continuing momentum of democratization process in
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>F. Return to theme that <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> should
                            permit Panama to start construction of Coco Solo container port before
                            treaty comes into force (we replied that planning steps already
                            permitted will use up much of intervening time).</p>
                        <p>G. Torrijos’s evident feeling that turning over houses to Panamanians to
                            use freely as occupants will be politically important in convincing
                            Panamanian people that a new era has really begun for them.</p>
                        <p>H. Panamanian concern that any closed down or abandoned items be either
                            turned over to <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> for Panamanian use
                            or maintained intact by <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> guards or
                            joint watchmen, if necessary, to prevent vandalism or deterioration;
                            Coco Solo school was cited in this connection.</p>
                        <p>I. Determination of <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            expressed to help combat deforestation (his appreciation of problem
                            appears quite imprecise).</p>
                        <p>3. We raised question of Panamanian debts to <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, in context of upcoming treaty implementation debate.

                            encouragement to these groups because that would endanger the

                            could not permit one nation getting involved in a way which would draw
                            others into a conflict. This would cause the United States to assess the

                            about other nations participating in the Nicaraguan conflict; he

                            <hi rend="italic">Carter.</hi> We have many problems with Nicaragua,
                            don’t we? I hope that working together with you, Venezuela, Colombia and
                            others that we can quickly bring a peaceful settlement to this serious
                            problem and restore democracy and preserve human rights in Nicaragua. We
                            are very eager that this problem be solved without any more blood of the
                            Nicaraguan people being shed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Torrijos.</hi> I agree with you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Carter.</hi> To do this, we need close communication.
                            As you know, we have sent William Rogers [<persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1"
                                >Jorden</persName>] to represent us, and we believe that he and
                            others can coordinate the careful efforts that will be necessary to
                            reach agreement on a solution. Do you agree with that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Torrijos.</hi> That is a very good idea. Now it is
                            important for all countries to be discouraged from engaging in
                            incursions with their military forces. The problem can be reduced to one
                            simple definition: “An insane man with an armed gang of criminals
                            engaged in a massacre of a defenseless population.” We must try for an
                            early solution because otherwise the massacre will go on. The borders,
                            Costa Rica and Honduras, are already filling with refugees. There are
                            already 8,000 on the border of Honduras and the President says he can’t
                            do anything for them. I am told that by Monday there will be 11,000
                            there. We must get our Red Cross organizations working on the problem.
                            We are continuing to analyze the situation, but it is an indigestible
                            one. You, <pb n="477" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_477"/>Mr. President, have
                            great prestige, very, very great prestige, on this continent. There is
                            nothing you can’t do by means of dialogue.</p>
                        <p>We have been informed that Nicaragua is now inflaming the bellicose
                            feelings between Honduras and El Salvador, promoting conflict there in
                            order to solve its own problems. I have told the leaders of Honduras not
                            to fall for that.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Carter.</hi> Let me respond briefly to the points you
                            have made. I believe your assessment of what needs to be done is very
                            accurate. First, the efforts of all peace-loving countries in the
                            hemisphere must be coordinated, and we are very glad to participate in
                            that effort. Secondly, mediation efforts must be used to the maximum
                            degree, and here again we would be pleased to participate. Thirdly, the
                            Red Cross must be involved in the relief effort and I will start taking
                            steps in that direction immediately. I appreciate your leadership on
                            that. Lastly, a common declaration is necessary that this matter must be
                            resolved without military attack from the outside, preserving the
                            integrity of all countries, and that includes El Salvador and Honduras.
                            I agree with all this. Please confirm that I have understood you
                            fully.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Torrijos.</hi> Yes, Mr. President. First, as I said
                            the problem comes down to one of an insane man in control of an armed
                            gang engaged in a massacre. Secondly, the warning that nobody should
                            interfere should be issued, but it should be valid for or applied to
                            all. Thirdly, I think that all due precautions must be taken not to
                            inflame the situation between El Salvador and Honduras, making the
                            Nicaragua situation secondary in importance. Mr. President, you have
                            enough prestige to get anything you want in a conversation with any
                            President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Carter.</hi> I appreciate your high opinion of me. I
                            will certainly do my best. I greatly value your partnership and help and
                            intend to pursue your ideas. I will keep you informed of any progress I
                            may make. I would report to you on the attitude of Nicaraguan officials
                            when I know. I think it is important for the two of us to share
                            information with each other and likewise share the responsibility to
                            restore peace. Therefore, I will follow up on these matters immediately
                            and hope that we will keep each other thoroughly informed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Torrijos.</hi> Very good. Mr. President, I should just
                            like to congratulate you on what you have achieved in using your good
                            offices to bring a solution to the situation in the Middle East.<note

                        <p>The Foreign Minister called me three times after the President had called
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, and he himself
                            spoke to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> twice.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> asked that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GN_1">Gonzales Revilla</persName> convey the
                            following information to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has decided
                            to follow our position on non-intervention. “Because of the respect and
                            friendship which he has for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>, he accepts and obeys this policy.”</p>
                        <p>2. A most important element in the situation is the support which
                            Nicaragua has received from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. He
                            said it was a shame that <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> passivity
                            had allowed these three countries to come to the aid of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>3. It is necessary for our mediation effort to produce early progress and
                            results.</p>
                        <p>4. The problem of Nicaragua is not one for the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss>; it is a problem for a psychiatrist. <persName

                        <p>5. El Salvadorean President Romero had asked <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> to ask President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> for international humanitarian assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> asked that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> have as much faith in
                            Torrijos’ judgment as <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            has in Carter’s.</p>
                        <pb n="479" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_479"/>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> will make sure that
                            Venezuelan planes, which are now stationed in Panama, will not take off
                            for Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my question of why <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> had considered an air strike last night, the
                            Foreign Minister said that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1"
                                >Perez</persName> had received reports saying that the human rights
                            situation in Nicaragua was getting extremely bad, and that something
                            more dramatic was necessary.</p>
                        <p>I asked him why he thought <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> had called the attack off. He answered:
                            “because of the President’s personal intervention” and because of the
                            persuasiveness of our arguments. He said that he conveyed the message
                            from me and from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            much more strongly than we had. <hi rend="italic">He also said that one
                                very important thing is for us to continue sending encouraging signs
                                and words to both <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>

                            Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala and
                            ask them to support the mediation effort and to suggest a ceasefire. <hi

                                195</ref>.</note> There are two ways to interpret that message.
                            First, that <gloss target="#t_Gen_1">Gen.</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> really intended to
                            launch an attack, and if this were the case, that would have had very

                                >U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian relations, and for all of Central America.
                            The second interpretation is that the message was intended to stimulate
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> to action, and we, frankly,
                            don’t appreciate that either. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss

                                creating stable and peaceful conditions for a genuine move to

                            produce serious consequences for the entire region. The difficult thing
                            is to create a political environment where peace and democracy will

                            He explained that <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> policy has to
                            work within a kind of paradox. On the one hand, the <gloss

                            but at the same time, others want us to play a leadership role. We first
                            tried to throw our support behind a Central American mediation effort,
                            but everyone said that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> should
                            take the leadership. We have reluctantly assumed that leadership, but
                            still we want others to be involved in a genuinely multilateral effort.
                            While Panama perhaps should not be directly involved in the mediation
                            effort, <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that he

                            rests with Panama, Venezuela and others. It is necessary that all of our

                            other governments and with the opposition, including the extremists,

                        <p>In just one year’s time the two treaties which you and I have signed and
                            solemnized will enter into force. We have affirmed that, as partners in
                            a common purpose, our two countries want the period of transition which
                            lies ahead to be smooth and effective. Making this a reality will
                            require the dedication, foresight, and understanding of many
                            individuals. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName>
                            will be assuming his duties at this particularly auspicious moment.<note

                                Panama on September 30.</note> He has my highest confidence in
                            representing me as we work together at our common task.</p>
                        <p>I expect all United States Government officials associated with efforts
                            to plan and implement the treaties to perform their tasks with <pb

                            sensitivity. As they work with representatives of the Government of
                            Panama, these officials will seek solutions to problems in the same
                            spirit that led us to agreement last year.</p>
                        <p>In the months since you and I exchanged ratification documents for the
                            Panama Treaties, representatives of our two countries have made a
                            promising beginning in planning for treaty implementation. They have
                            approached this task in good faith, as equals, and with a determination
                            to overcome differences. I am confident that these contacts will be
                            broadened and deepened during the next year, and that there will be full
                            opportunity for consultation before decisions are taken in all matters
                            affecting our mutual interest. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1"

                            in a later conversation—was that some of the information seems wrong,
                            some is old; and part is distorted. I have asked the Agency to do a
                            paper for us on the whole report,<note n="8" xml:id="d200fn8">Not

                            all, the Panamanians have been discussing the possibility of building a
                            new hydro-electric plant with the Soviets for a long time; I would be
                            surprised if an agreement has been reached on that. Secondly, my
                            impression of the primary purpose of the Panamanian trip was to get the
                            Soviets and their allies to sign on to the Neutrality Treaty. The
                            Panamanians have been pursuing signatures to the Neutrality Treaty in
                            every forum—the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, the Non-Aligned Movement. They
                            believe that the more numerous the signatures and the more diverse the
                            signators, the more valid the Treaty. Surely, we cannot fault them for
                            that.</p>
                        <p>There are <hi rend="italic">two questions</hi> related to Panama’s
                            apparent desire to seek new ties with the Soviets and East Europe. One
                            is the question of <hi rend="italic">timing</hi>; and no one with any
                            understanding of the American political system—and that includes
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and certainly most
                            of his advisers—could think that this was a good time for such an
                            initiative. The second question is whether, in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >long-term</hi>, we should actively discourage normal, commercial
                            ties—like we and many Latin American governments have with the Soviet
                            Union and East Europe—by Panama.</p>
                        <p>There is no question in my mind that we should actively discourage such
                            ties by Panama during this transition period of the next two years,
                            especially while the implementing legislation is being considered.
                            However, in the long term, I do not believe that it is right for us to
                            discourage the Panamanians from doing something that we ourselves do, or
                            which many of the Latin American countries, like Colombia, Venezuela,
                            Costa Rica, Argentina, etc., do. It would be hypocritical and
                            paternalistic for us to tell the Panamanians not to do something we
                            ourselves do, and to a country as sensitive to <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> paternalism and hypocrisy as Panama is, it would
                            likely be ineffective, and it would make us look terribly
                            inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>One of Panama’s foreign policy goals is clearly to project itself as a
                                <hi rend="italic">neutral</hi> as well as a Non-Aligned country.
                            Panamanians believe that neutrality and non-alignment are essential for
                            them to effectively run the Canal, and in the long term, I believe they
                            will pursue that path.</p>
                        <p>I will send forward the report from the Agency on this intelligence item
                            as soon as I receive it.</p>

                            are effectively coordinated, the following instructions shall apply:</p>
                        <p>—The statutory responsibilities of the Ambassador are set forth in P.L.
                            93-475, dated October 26, 1974, (22 U.S.C. 2680a). The statutory
                            responsibilities of the Ambassador and the Administrator also will be
                            prescribed in Sections 102 and 207 of the legislation implementing the
                            Panama Canal Treaties.</p>
                        <p>—Pursuant to Presidential Guidance, the Administrator, as Chief Executive
                            Officer of the Panama Canal Commission, subject to the direction and
                            supervision of the Board of Directors, executes the responsibility of
                            the Commission with respect to the management, operation, and
                            maintenance of the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>—The Ambassador in the Republic of Panama has the responsibility to
                            assess the effect of Panama Canal Commission plans and activities in
                            light of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> objectives in the Republic
                            of Panama and to make appropriate observations thereon, in Panama and in
                            Washington. His concern will be with the effect of Panama Canal
                            Commission activities on <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> relations
                            with the Republic of Panama, and not with management, operation, and
                            maintenance of the Panama Canal. Of equal importance, he is responsible
                            for assessing the impact of the Government of Panama’s policies and
                            activities on <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> objectives and for
                            promoting the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s understanding and
                            acceptance of these objectives. The Ambassador shall have no authority
                            to direct the Administrator to initiate or to withhold policies or
                            activities regarding the management, operation, or maintenance of the
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>—To enable the Ambassador to discharge his responsibility, the
                            Administrator will keep the Ambassador fully and currently informed with
                            respect to the official activities and operations of the officers and
                            employees of the Commission in the Republic of Panama. In particular,
                            the Administrator will inform the Ambassador of the proposed initiation
                            of major activities, operations, or changes in policy of the Commission
                            in reasonable time to permit the Ambassador to comment on such matters
                            in Panama, and, if required, in Washington, prior to their initiation.
                            The Ambassador shall similarly inform the Administrator of all
                            activities and policies of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> agencies
                            in Panama which may affect the management and operation of the Canal and
                            provide him the same opportunity for comment.</p>
                        <p>—The Administrator will coordinate through the Ambassador proposed
                            official contacts between Panama Canal Commission and Panamanian
                            Government officials other than those normally involved in the
                            Commission’s activities. He will keep the Ambassador informed of the
                            results of these as well as other significant contacts with Panamanian
                            officials.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> gave me a detailed
                            briefing on recent political and economic developments in Panama. He is
                            convinced that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> is not only
                            getting used to being President, but also is determined to build an
                            independent political base and take charge of the Panamanian Government.
                            Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> apparently
                            realizes the difficult economic state Panama <pb n="491" facs="0526"
                                xml:id="pg_491"/>is currently in, and intends to throw his full
                            weight behind the business community, abandoning whatever leftist
                            supporters he once had. Examples of this include various recommendations
                            which <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> has accepted from
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> on establishing
                            business advisory committees. <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> has also agreed to appoint a number of people which
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> has recommended.
                            Thirdly, <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> is determined to
                            appoint the best people to high governmental positions even when that
                            means the firing of Torrijos’ relatives. For example, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> has fired Hugo <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> as Director of the Casinos,
                            and has appointed Sosa to clean up the operation there. He has also
                            refused to appoint Torrijos’ brother to be Ambassador to Spain and
                            instead will be sending Jaime Ingram, Head of the Cultural Department in
                            Panama and a famous pianist. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> has apparently acquiesced in all of these
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> has become very close to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>, and has been asked to
                            advise him on almost a daily basis. He said that he would not have
                            accepted this position, which he does without remuneration, unless he
                            was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> could be
                            a good President. (Comment: A more accurate description, in my opinion,
                            is that <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> would not have
                            accepted the position unless he could have a lot of influence on
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>’s actions, which he
                            apparently has had.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> has come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> this time for three reasons. First, he
                            has come to describe what <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>
                            stands for and what he intends to do. He has already spoken to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton Jordan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_2">Frank Moore</persName>. Secondly, he wanted to
                            explore the possibilities of a State visit by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>. Thirdly, he wanted to ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton</persName>, who knows the
                            Saudis as well as he knows the Panamanians, to recommend to them that
                            they invest their money in Panama’s international banks. He believes
                            that Panama’s international requirements for investment are enormous,
                            and that Saudi money will be essential.</p>
                        <p>I was very frank with <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>. I
                            told him that he has got a long way to go before the idea of a <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> State visit is even conceivable to
                            us. I said that at this time, Panama is identified with the Sandinistas,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> is seen as a puppet of
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> and a leftist, and
                            the primary <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>-Panamanian issue on our
                            agenda—implementing legislation—is in jeopardy because of these two
                            points. I told him that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>
                            needs to establish his credentials as someone who is pro-business, is in
                            charge, and has a clear and fiscally sound economic policy. Furthermore,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> needs to show the world
                            that the Panamanians are not consorting with the Sandinistas. Until
                            these points are clearly demonstrated to the American people, it would
                            be difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government to
                            consider encouraging the Saudis to put their money in Panama, and it
                            would be inconceivable to consider a State visit. Moreover, I suggested
                            that he discourage <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> from
                            thinking about quick-fix, international cures to their internal economic
                            problems. The real answers must come from internal policies by
                            Panama.</p>
                        <pb n="492" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_492"/>
                        <p>After some give-and-take, we talked about a three-step process. First,
                            the Panamanians consider a high-level trip to Saudi Arabia for the
                            principal purpose of explaining to the Saudis where Panama is on the
                            map, as well as the fact that Panama is a banking center. Secondly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> needs to do a number of
                            things in Panama which show the new direction he is heading, and then he
                            can demonstrate his new image in the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> by a private visit to New York and Washington to meet
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> business community.
                            Finally, if these conditions were met, I told him that we would consider
                            endorsing Panama’s request for Saudi investment. As regards a State
                            visit, we would consider it at that time. I was in short very
                            noncommittal.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> will now seek an
                            invitation from the Saudi Government for a high-level delegation to
                            visit there.</p>

                            violence. Your talking points should include the following.</p>
                        <p>2. We are deeply committed to the success of the mediation effort, which
                            is now at a critical stage. An outbreak of widespread violence at this
                            point would cause the effort to fail. <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1"
                                >Somoza</persName> could win, or radical elements could prevail and

                        <p>3. If Panama in any significant way contributes to a renewed outbreak of
                            fighting, this would have a profoundly negative effect on the present
                            excellent nature of our relations and the good feeling that has been so
                            evident in the course of 1978. Such a negative effect would be evidenced
                            within the administration and would obviously extend to the Congress
                            which will have the implementing legislation before it in late January.
                            It should be clearly understood that if such an effect results as a
                            consequence of Panamanian involvement in the Nicaraguan crisis, then

                        <p>4. Certain information available to us is both disturbing and puzzling.
                            That information ranges beyond earlier reports of support for certain
                            elements of the Sandinistas, including the provision of arms. Even more
                            disturbing are reports of shipments of substantial quantities of arms
                            from Cuba through Panama destined for hostilities in Nicaragua. Such
                            latter reports add an entirely new dimension to the equation and, in
                            fact, to our perception of our relations. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1"

                            Group (<gloss target="#t_JRG_1">JRG</gloss>) met in Panama during the
                            period 8–12 January 1979. During the visit, the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> contingent participated in the signing of three
                            treaty-related bilateral agreements, received treaty implementation
                            status briefings from the Panama Review Committee (<gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>) and the Binational Working Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_BWG_1">BWG</gloss>), made a courtesy call on
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>, and met with
                            representatives of various Canal Zone Labor and Civic groups. Three
                            major points emerged as characteristic of the current situation in
                            Panama. First, the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> decision on the
                            new labor-management system and wage policy may become a bilateral
                            issue. It is clear that the Government of Panama (<gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) fully supports labor’s position for
                            maximum benefits and high wages. Second, implementation planning at the
                            Joint Subcommittee level has reached a critical stage—with most
                            committees now engaged in detailed planning to accomplish agreed upon
                            objectives. Planning cycle involves establishing procedures, identifying
                            resources, scheduling training, and then actual implementation. The one
                            major exception is the juridical subcommittee which has yet to meet.
                            Both parties realize the need for urgent action in order to meet 1
                            October 1979 implementation deadline. Formation of the new Panama Canal
                            Authority (<gloss target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss>) should help reduce
                            planning lag on <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> side. And third,
                            the spirit of cooperation and friendship established as the result of
                            the treaty ratification atmosphere remains good. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> pledged his government’s full
                            cooperation in making the Canal Treaty work and will apparently exercise
                            close supervision over all treaty-related matters.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bilateral Agreements</hi>. One of the major
                            objectives of the trip was to participate in the formal signing of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA_1">FAA</gloss> Agreement and to resolve
                            differences which were delaying conclusion of the Prisoner Exchange
                            Treaty and the Cemetery Agreement. The <gloss target="#t_FAA_1"
                                >FAA</gloss> Agreement, which concerns air traffic control and

                            />8 January 1979. The final details of the other two pacts were
                            negotiated by representatives of both parties and the formal signing
                            ceremony occurred on 11 January 1979. All three agreements were called
                            for in the Panama Canal Treaties and related agreements. Details on the
                            latter two agreements are at Tab A.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Attached

                            determination of its labor-management policy and the wage scales for
                            various types of canal-related employees—both Canal Commission and
                            Defense. Although our policy is still under active consideration, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has come down strongly on the
                            side of the local unions. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>
                            projected the subject to the forefront with a sweeping statement that
                            the only “Just” solution for the wage problem was maintenance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> wage scale for old <hi

                                >GOP</gloss> favors one wage scale, wage bargaining, no <gloss

                            position, but <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> made it
                            clear that labor was the principal treaty implementing issue and
                            described it as a dynamic political problem which was key to the
                            “partnership” concept of the new treaties. <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1"
                                >Lewis</persName> did acknowledge, however, that under the
                            provisions of the Canal Treaty, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            had the unilateral right to decide the final labor policy and wage
                            scales.</p>

                            selected subcommittees (ports/railroad/post office) produced the
                            following general impressions:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Implementation Planning Status</hi>. Both the Defense
                            and canal subcommittees have generally reached agreement on their
                            planning objectives and are heavily engaged in developing specific plans
                            to accomplish same. The one principal exception is the juridical
                            subcommittee which has yet to meet. Working atmosphere is good and the
                                <gloss target="#t_BWG_1">BWG</gloss> is carefully monitoring the

                            at the appropriate level. The next several weeks are critical, as
                            proposals from both side are considered and adjudicated. Some lag time
                            has been experienced on the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> side
                            due to their up-to-now slow policy and decision-making process, key
                            personnel shifts, <pb n="496" facs="0531" xml:id="pg_496"/>and a lack of

                            unions on 11 January 1979. Purpose of the meeting was to solicit views
                            from group on treaty implementation and related problems. Tenor of
                            meeting centered on resident concerns regarding wages, early retirement,
                            future of the Canal Zone College and the status of non-profit

                            jurisdiction. In regard to the Canal Zone College, we informed the group
                            of the recent favorable decision made by Mr. <persName

                            Residents see the College as a major factor in maintaining their

                        <p>2. Interim measures must be taken now to coordinate United States policy
                            in preparation for Treaty implementation. For this purpose, the

                            will be similarly constituted. It will seek, as necessary, <pb n="499"

                            that occur between meetings. The Implementing Group will have no
                            authority to direct the Secretary of the Army to initiate or withhold
                            policies or activities regarding the management, operation or

                            Committee to be created under Article III of the Treaty. Participation
                            of the United States will be coordinated by the State Department in

                            he wants to draw the American members of the Commission from private

                            he indicated his preference for a Canal operating agency whose funds

                            budget. He noted his disagreement with the proposal contained in the
                            Administration’s Panama Canal Treaty implementing legislation to
                            establish the Panama Canal Commission as a Government corporation.</p>
                        <p>You asked for my comments.</p>
                        <p>The present Canal operating agency, the Panama Canal Company, is a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government corporation. It prepares and
                            submits to Congress an annual budget showing its projected revenues and
                            expenses for the upcoming year. The budget is routinely reviewed each
                            year in the Transportation Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
                            Committee, and approved by law, subject to any limitations imposed by
                            Congress. The Company’s financial transactions are audited by the
                            General Accounting Office under principles similar to those governing
                            commercial transactions.</p>
                        <p>The Treaty does not specify the organizational form of the Commission.
                            This issue is left for determination by the United States.<note n="3"

                        <p>The Treaty implementing legislation proposed by the Administration, with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> concurrence, would continue the
                            present system by creating the Panama Canal Commission as the corporate
                            successor to the Panama Canal Company.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Murphy has introduced legislation which would abandon the
                            corporate form and create the Commission as an agency subject to the
                            authorization and appropriations process, under the general supervision
                            of the Department of Defense. All revenues received by the Commission
                            would be deposited in the Treasury. The Commission <pb n="502"
                                facs="0537" xml:id="pg_502"/>would expend money in such amounts and
                            for such purposes as provided in annual authorization and appropriation
                            acts. Murphy’s desire is to tighten the degree of Congressional control
                            over the Commission.</p>
                        <p>I believe the corporate form proposed by the Administration’s legislation
                            is preferable to Chairman Murphy’s proposal for the following
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>—As a corporation, the Commission will be expected to be self-sustaining,
                            thus limiting the possibility of subsidizing the Canal operation from
                            general revenues through the annual appropriations process.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d207fn4">

                        </p>
                        <p>—Efficient operation of the Canal requires a degree of operating
                            flexibility and management discipline which the corporate form provides.
                            It was for this reason that Congress in 1951 established the Panama
                            Canal Company as a Government corporation.<note n="5" xml:id="d207fn5">

                        <p>1. On 9 March 1979, the principal Panamanian Government officials
                            involved in implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty met at the
                            Presidencia and decided to take a hard line with the United States to
                            obtain more benefits for Panama under the treaties. Those present at the
                            meeting were President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Aristides
                                Royo</persName>, Finance Minister Ernesto <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName> Balladares, Panama Canal
                            Authority (<gloss target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss>) Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis Galindo</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss> Deputy Director Eduardo Tejeira,
                                <gloss target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss> Advisor <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Fernando Manfredo</persName>, and Panamanian
                            Ambassador to Washington Carlos Lopez Guevara.</p>
                        <p>2. Although <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> was the
                            principal protagonist for a tough line with the United States on Treaty
                            Implementation, this posture was also championed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>. Both <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>
                            said that the only way that the Americans will accept Panamanian demands
                            is to treat them tough and keep strong pressure on them. Further, the
                            best proof of the correctness of this hard line strategy was that
                            National Guard Commander General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Omar
                                Torrijos Herrera</persName> used it successfully during the Treaty
                            Negotiations which gave Panama such favorable results. (Source Comment:
                            It is believed that this group would not be taking such a hard line
                            policy unless encouraged to do so by General Torrijos.)</p>
                        <pb n="507" facs="0542" xml:id="pg_507"/>
                        <p>3. On specific issues, the group advocated maintaining a strong position
                            with the United States on the right of Panama to tax retroactively the
                            earnings of companies now operating in the Canal Zone. They also agreed
                            to require that the United States rehabilitate the landing field and
                            houses at Coco Solo as well as all equipment and properties that are to
                            be turned over to Panama on 1 October 1979. The group also decided to
                            demand that the Panama Canal Commission, which will function from 1
                            October 1979 to 2000, pay all the expenses until 2000 for maintenance of
                            the Canal Zone lands and properties which revert to Panama. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> also suggested that the United
                            States should be charged for the use of water from the Chagres River
                            which has been used for 75 years to operate the Canal locks.</p>
                        <p>4. The only dissenting voice in the group was Lopez Guevara, who said
                            that such hard line tactics, while successful during the Treaty
                            Negotiations, would not work today because of the Treaty Implementation
                            opposition which already exists in the United States Congress and that
                            Panama should be working with rather than against the United States. He
                            considers the attitude taken by <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>
                            to be ultimately bad for Panama.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Conservative elements in Congress have as you know characterized the
                            Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 as a “giveaway,” requiring the turnover to
                            Panama of billions in real estate and equipment. In attacking the
                            Administration’s Treaty implementing legislation, opponents have
                            concentrated on the cost to the United States. They have criticized the
                            Administration for conveying the impression during last year’s Treaty
                                <pb n="508" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_508"/>debate that there would be
                            no cost to the United States taxpayer. (While our rhetoric was by no
                            means always clear, the intent was to indicate that <hi rend="italic"
                                >payments to Panama</hi> under the Treaty would come from Canal
                            revenues, not from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Treasury.)</p>

                            although you did indicate that there would be some additional expense.
                            On request of Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                            >Bauman</persName>, we agreed to furnish a breakdown of these costs to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> over the life of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>As the attached memorandum shows, the 1978 figures were indeed too
                                low.<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">Draft memorandum, dated March 22,
                                is attached but not printed.</note> In recalculating and refining
                            its estimates, the Defense Department has raised its global figure from
                            under $200 million to $757 million. The Office of Personnel Management
                            figure exceeds $200 million (up from $150 million). Together with other
                            incremental costs, the overall total to be reported on this basis would
                            be $980 million. Taking into account offsetting savings, the figure can
                            be reduced to $869 million.</p>
                        <p>A certain increase in the $350 million estimate was to be expected, as
                            the legislative proposals for early retirement benefits were worked out,
                            the cost of relocating military facilities became clearer, and other
                            requirements not originally envisaged gradually came into view. Much of
                            the major escalation is due to the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                            recomputation, which may be unduly generous. For example, the tabular
                            computation of projected <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> costs is
                            headed by an item entitled “base operations” for which an annual
                            increased appropriation of $16.5 million is projected through a period
                            of 21 years. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has not yet clarified
                            for us why “base operations” should be any more expensive in the future
                            than in the past. This one item accounts for over $300 million of the
                            estimated cost to <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The way in which we respond to the charges regarding Treaty costs may
                            have a determining effect on the character of the implementing
                            legislation. The credibility of the President and the Secretaries is at
                            issue. It should not be needlessly jeopardized to protect <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> budgetary flexibility.</p>
                        <p>We appear to have two options. We can publish the figures as they now
                            stand, or we can undertake a high-level blue-pencilling operation. <pb
                                n="509" facs="0544" xml:id="pg_509"/>In either case we will have to
                            explain that the new figures are based on further analysis and the
                            emergence of additional requirements. We would contrast the result with

                            committee action reducing 1980 level by 50 percent. To the extent that
                            this latest action was based on human rights considerations, it was

                                provisions in the implementing legislation bill that were
                                inconsistent with the treaty. <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                    >Murphy</persName> apparently disclaimed any intention of

                                <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> is operating in a
                            constrained situation, and we will try to minimize, not aggravate, his
                            problems, in producing a bill which is consistent with the Treaties.
                            Following the Committee’s partial markup this morning (at which some
                            improvements were made), <persName corresp="#p_WC_1">Warren</persName>
                            feels that four main problem areas remain:</p>
                        <p>1. The provision that no payments will be made to Panama if an
                            expropriation claim against Panama is outstanding. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> appears to agree that this
                            provision is at odds with the terms of the Treaty, and we think he will
                            be helpful tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>2. The provision requiring that all costs of Treaty implementation
                            (including an estimated $870 million in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> expenditures) be paid out of tolls before Panama could
                            receive the $10 million annual “contingency” payment under Article XIII
                            of the Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_WC_1">Warren</persName> called
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> tonight to say that
                            this is potentially the most troublesome problem; <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> was noncommittal.</p>
                        <p>3. The provision authorizing the President to name a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military officer to replace the Panama
                            Canal Commission in the event of wartime or national emergency. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName>’s Committee approved
                            that provision today, we hope that the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                            may help us modify it.</p>
                        <p>4. The provision requiring Congressional approval for each transfer of
                            property required by the Treaty. The House will probably insist on this
                            provision, but the Senate would be likely to help us modify it.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee completed its
                            mark-up of the implementing legislation introduced by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack Murphy</persName>. A number of issues
                            raising treaty violation questions were resolved favorably, albeit by
                            narrow margins. Some were not, however, and will have to be dealt with
                            in other forums.</p>
                        <p>The Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the Judiciary Committee
                            have already marked up, having treated such issues as employee benefits
                            and the immigration provision. The House Foreign Affairs Committee will
                            mark up on April 5. The House Rules Committee will resolve differences
                            among the four committees on return from Easter recess April 22. House
                            floor action is not likely before early May. The Senate will probably
                            not consider the legislation until the House acts.</p>
                        <pb n="514" facs="0549" xml:id="pg_514"/>
                        <p>During mark-up, the Merchant Marine Committee adopted favorable positions
                            on the following issues:</p>
                        <p>—It dropped the objectionable <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Murphy</persName> bill provision that no payments could be made to
                            Panama so long as the Canal Commission asserted that a plausible <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> expropriation claim was
                            outstanding.</p>
                        <p>—It deleted the provision that Panama’s representatives on the board of
                            the Commission would be subject to prosecution under <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> bribery and conflict of interest
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>—It provided for monthly payments to Panama. <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Murphy</persName> had previously proposed quarterly payments.</p>
                        <p>—It restored as separate binational entities the Joint Commission on the
                            Environment and the Diplomatic Consultative Committee.</p>
                        <p>—It eliminated the requirement that the tolls base should include
                            amortization costs (although it retained the requirement that interest
                            payments and early retirement payments would continue in the tolls
                            base).</p>
                        <p>Issues which were not resolved favorably in the Merchant Marine mark-up
                            include:</p>
                        <p>—The bill provides that in wartime or national emergency the President
                            would be authorized to displace the Commission with a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> military officer.</p>
                        <p>—The <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Bauman</persName>-sponsored provision
                            requiring that all costs of treaty implementation (including <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> costs until the year 2000) would be
                            paid out of Commission profits before Panama could receive its
                            “contingency” payment under Article XIII (4) (c) of the Treaty remains
                            in the bill. This provision would insure that Panama would never receive
                            this payment.</p>
                        <p>—The bill now authorizes only those transfers of property which are
                            required upon the entry into force of the treaty; all subsequent
                            transfers must be approved by Congress. This approach reflects the view
                            prevalent in the House that legislation is necessary to transfer <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> property.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the foregoing issues raised by the Merchant Marine Committee’s
                            mark-up, there are important differences between Merchant Marine and
                            Post Office on employee issues. Generally the Post Office Committee has
                            sought to reduce canal employee benefits to general Federal employee
                            levels. If enacted, such provisions could cause a strike or slowdown.
                            Merchant Marine has resisted any substantial watering down of the
                            Administration’s commitment to Canal employees.</p>

                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">David Bowen</persName> is
                            planning to offer an amendment in the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                                (<gloss target="#t_HFAC_1">HFAC</gloss>) that would replace the <pb
                                n="515" facs="0550" xml:id="pg_515"/>provision authorizing the

                                >U.S.</gloss> military officer in wartime. While we do not have the
                            exact text of this amendment, we believe it will be acceptable and that
                            it has an excellent chance of approval by the <gloss target="#t_HFAC_1"
                                >HFAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The “contingency payment” and “property transfer” issues are potentially
                            more serious and must be resolved satisfactorily during the legislative
                            process. At this stage, we do not have the strength to obtain
                            corrections on the floor of the House.</p>
                        <p>The “contingency payment” issue is highly volatile politically since it
                            relates to the costs of treaty implementation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> and his committee do not feel
                            that it would be possible to pass a bill on the House floor which, by
                            implication, could be read as allowing profits for Panama while the
                            American taxpayer foots the bill for costs associated with the transfer
                            of the Panama Canal to Panama. We concur in this assessment and feel
                            that the best chance to change this apparent treaty violation is in the
                            Senate.</p>
                        <p>The “property transfer” issue may conceivably be properly resolved on the
                            House floor, but only if our lobbying efforts succeed in raising the
                            level of support for the implementing legislation generally and if the
                            House leadership actively seeks to convince Members that subsequent
                            votes on the transfer of property to Panama would be politically
                            undesirable. In any event, as noted below, we believe the Senate will
                            insist on a resolution of the “property transfer” issue that we will be
                            able to accept.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we will be working with Tip <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1"
                                >O’Neill</persName> and the Rules Committee in an effort to sustain
                            Merchant Marine’s position on the employee benefits issue.</p>

                        <p>Senators are not anxious to confront Panama Canal matters again, and
                            there will almost surely be no move to mark-up the legislation until the
                            House has acted. On the other hand, the Senate will be more sensitive to
                            possible treaty violation issues than the House, which accepts no
                            responsibility for ratification.</p>
                        <p>The Armed Services Committee will have primary jurisdiction over this
                            legislation in the Senate. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SJC_1"
                                >Stennis</persName> was an opponent of the Canal treaties, but we
                            have had informal contacts with his staff and feel that he will be
                            helpful. Other committees which will likely share jurisdiction with
                            Armed Services are Foreign Relations, Governmental Affairs, Judiciary,
                            and Commerce, Science and Transportation. These committees will
                            apparently play a minor role.</p>
                        <p>It will be important to make an early effort to alert <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJC_1">Stennis</persName> to the two issues likely to be
                            outstanding after House action, namely the “property transfer” and
                            “contingency payment” issues. After House <pb n="516" facs="0551"
                                xml:id="pg_516"/>action, we believe it may be desirable to ask you
                            to discuss this with <persName corresp="#p_SJC_1">Stennis</persName>. We
                            expect him to uphold the Senate position that the treaty is
                            self-executing in transferring property, but we would want to work with
                            him on a compromise which would permit the House to preserve its formal
                            legal position that transfers of <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>

                        <p>The “contingency payment” issue will be more difficult because the $870
                            million we now estimate as the cost of treaty implementation is
                            considerably higher than that estimated during the treaty debate in the
                            Senate. Nevertheless, we have already undertaken a public affairs

                            commensurate with the benefits. With an intensive <gloss

                            of all implementing costs before the contingent treaty payment to

                            control of property transfers; and the requirement to continue the

                            called on President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> to bring
                            him up to date on the progress of implementing legislation and other

                        <p>2. I found President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> in a
                            rather sombre mood, as he had just been informed by Fernando Eleta
                            (owner of TV 4 and Foreign Minister in the 1960s) about the lop-sided
                            House vote cutting off <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–80 aid.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that he found it
                            difficult to understand how a great country could act so small. He asked
                            what could be done about it. I said that the vote had taken place
                            despite very strong administration efforts to avoid it, which I
                            described in some detail, and that it was indicative of the anti-treaty
                            furor which would have to play itself out before we could move ahead. I
                            said I thought we had a good chance of getting a clean foreign
                            assistance bill out of the Senate and then restoring the assistance to
                            Panama in conference.</p>
                        <p>3. Turning to implementing legislation, I gave Pres <persName

                            events of the past week, especially the emergence of H.R. 111 from the
                            House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. I explained in some
                            detail the successful efforts to purge the bill of treaty violations and
                            described what problems remained. I mentioned the major role played by
                            Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">David Bowen</persName> in
                            working toward a bill which was in conformity with the treaty, and
                            stressed that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>’s meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">Bowen</persName> on March 23 had been

                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> and <persName

                            in working to eliminate certain provisions which had emerged from the
                            subcommittee, such as the expropriation clause, and that only by a close
                            vote in the committee was he able to have the bill reported out. I said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> vote and the aid vote show
                            that we are in for extremely difficult times on the floor of the House,
                            but that the Departments of State and Defense and the White House were
                            engaged in massive efforts to educate members and staffers on the
                            legislation and to prepare for the floor action, which could come in
                            about a month.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that his posture
                            through all this had been one of “serenity and tranquility” even though
                            he and his government were extremely concerned about what was happening
                            in Washington. He said he understood our political difficulties, but
                            that it was obviously of the utmost importance that we be able to meet
                            our treaty obligations and that he was being put under great political
                            pressure by these events. I said that his attitude and that of his
                            government was commendable, and that we deeply appreciated their
                            forebearance and their understanding of our political difficulties. I
                            assured him that everyone from the President on down was personally
                            engaged in the effort, and that we would simply have to work our way
                            through the present mood of the house and would eventually be
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>5. I conveyed to Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> the
                            news that Pres <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would have
                            a private working meeting with him on May 10, on <persName

                            important to him in view of the repercussions in Panama over
                            congressional treatment of the implementing legislation, and he
                            suggested an eventual joint press release in which Pres <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would assure Panama that the
                            United States would fulfill its obligation under the treaties, and that
                            Panama would make the same reciprocal representations. He also said that
                            he very much wished to have a letter from the President inviting him to
                            a private working meeting in Washington to discuss aspects of the

                            October 1, 1979, is now well underway. Representatives of our Embassy,
                            the Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government, and the <gloss

                            implementing plans and arrangements of various types. In connection with
                            this process, conclusion of a number of agreements with the Government
                            of Panama will be necessary. This memorandum requests Circular 175

                                developed “Circular 175 procedure” regulations to ensure that the
                                power to make treaties was exercised properly. Two types of Circular
                                175 requests exist. One requires the approval of full powers
                                (defined as heads of State and Foreign Ministers) to sign treaties
                                that will be sent to the Senate by the President for advice and
                                consent to ratification. The other, more typical request occurs in
                                the form of an action memorandum from a Department of State Bureau
                                or office to a Department official at the Assistant Secretary level
                                or above and requests authority to “negotiate, conclude, amend,

                            of matters. Three of the more significant agreements were signed
                            recently—a treaty concerning the transfer of prisoners, an agreement
                            providing for permanent <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> maintenance
                            of the American sector of Corozal Cemetery, and an agreement concerning

                            requirements have been satisfactorily addressed in each case, Ambassador

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>As you may recall, last year as the debate on the Canal Treaty began,
                            questions arose in the Senate about additional financial obligations the
                            United States would incur as a result of the treaty. In a February 10,
                            1978 letter signed by <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy Vance</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold Brown</persName> and Army

                            assurances were made to the Senate concerning treaty implementation
                            costs:</p>

                                would not be much more than $350M; and</p>
                            <p>—none of the appropriated $350M would go to Panama.</p>

                        <p>Within the Administration the validity of the three Secretaries’ $350M
                            figure was immediately called into question by <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                                >OMB</gloss> for two reasons—Defense costs were probably not fully
                            reflected in the estimate, and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> had
                            not been afforded the opportunity to review, scrub, or clear the number
                            before its presentation to the Senate. When the President’s 1980 budget
                            was submitted to Congress containing specific treaty implementation
                            costs, it became apparent that $350M was low. In response to questions
                            raised by the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, the
                            State Department forwarded a “reviewed and refined” treaty cost estimate
                            of $870.7M for the period <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979–2000,
                            which represented a 150% increase from the earlier $350M figure. House
                            opponents of the treaty seized the “cost growth” issue to illustrate the
                            Administration’s deceptive practices in selling the treaty to the
                            Senate. In a Dear Colleague letter,<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">Not
                                found.</note> Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                                >Bauman</persName> (R–MD) stated that the $350–$871M implementing
                            costs would continue to grow over time to more than $4B. Since the House
                            didn’t take part in the treaty ratification process, most members and
                            their staffs are unfamiliar with treaty provisions. Cynically, some
                            members are convinced that actual treaty costs will fall nearer the $4B
                            than the Administration’s $870.7M figure. Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>, unfortunately, has lent some

                            the preferential retirement benefits as specified in Article X(9) of the
                            Treaty. The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> costs result from the
                            need to relocate certain military facilities and to take over the
                            operation of schools, hospitals and some community services from the
                            present Canal Zone Government. Other federal agencies also have
                            additional costs, the most significant being the special retirement
                            benefits to be offered to the currently employed members of the Canal
                            work force. This expenditure ($205M) would compensate employees whose
                            careers are interrupted as the result of the treaty, and would provide
                            an incentive to others to continue to lend their skills to ensure the
                            efficient operation of the Canal.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BRG_1">Bob Beckel</persName> of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_2">Frank Moore</persName>’s staff has noted that the
                            President’s basic concern is that we insure that costs or programs
                            unrelated to the Canal Treaty not be allowed to be included in <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> or other agency Panama cost figures.
                            While <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> and State have reviewed the
                            costs at Tab A and are confident that these estimates are all related to
                            treaty requirements, the Senate’s reservations to the treaty, or to
                            promises made to Zone residents or Canal employees during the treaty
                            ratification process, they also admit that the estimate contains some
                            “padding” that covers the uncertainty of planning 21 years into the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>If the $870.7M figure is to be reduced—and it can be—we have several
                            options: a) let <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> squeeze the <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> portion of the implementation costs
                            yielding cuts as high as $40M (cost cuts would fall mainly in the base
                            operations area); b) fund the major non-<gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> cost, the $205M for the preferential retirement
                            benefits from the Canal toll base, not from <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> appropriations, thus reducing implementation costs to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>; or c) a combination of both
                            the above techniques.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned that by simply squeezing the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> numbers to obtain at most $40M in cuts we will lose
                            even more credibility on the Hill and create additional confusion among
                            House members who are now struggling to sort out the $350M to $870.7M to
                            $4B puzzle. Funding the retirement benefit out of tolls seems a more
                            fruitful approach to cost reduction. Simply acquiescing to Merchant
                            Marine Committee mark-up of the Administration’s Canal bill (<gloss
                                target="#t_HR_1">HR</gloss> 1716)—which would pay these benefits by
                            increasing Canal tolls by some 7%—is the easiest course of action.
                            Congress takes the credit for cost cuts—we probably get an acceptable
                            bill. Defense favors this tack and State, while not terribly keen on the
                            idea since they tend to think such actions violate the spirit of the
                            treaty, will go along.</p>
                        <p>Another way of making the $205M disappear from <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> appropriations, would be to retain in the Canal toll
                            base the interest charge on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            direct net investment in the Canal (a payment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of about $20M paid annually since
                            1951). The Administration’s bill (<gloss target="#t_HR_1">HR</gloss>
                            1716) proposed that this charge to the Canal Commission be dropped in
                            the future. This payment by the Canal to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> Treasury is retained in the <gloss target="#t_HR_1"
                                >HR</gloss> 1716 mark-up. If the interest was directed specifically
                            to fund the preferential retirement costs, the Treasury would then see
                            about an $8M annual increase in revenue above that which would <pb
                                n="527" facs="0562" xml:id="pg_527"/>have been expected, if the
                            Administration’s bill had passed Congress unamended.</p>
                        <p>The key though to getting a bill out of Congress that does not raise the
                            issue of treaty violation is to continue to educate the staffs and
                            members of the House about the treaty provisions—and not to make the
                            $870.7M become $830M by some budgetary magic. There is a new slant that
                            can be put on our $870.7M figure that may put it in better light and
                            thus help us to “sell” the Canal implementing bill. A useful way to look
                            at costs in this case would be to compare total Canal associated costs
                            to the United States <hi rend="italic">with</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >without</hi> a treaty over the period <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1979–2000. If an adjustment for decreased <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> activities (say 3% annually) can be
                            assumed in the 1990–2000 period <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a treaty,
                            instead of a steady <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> activity level
                            without a treaty, a <hi rend="italic">net</hi> cost of the treaty of
                            about $320M can be demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>While this is not exactly what the three Secretaries meant by their $350M
                                <hi rend="italic">appropriations</hi> estimate last year, it at
                            least puts the $870.7M sum in better perspective. The danger is that the
                            net cost of $320M may get mixed up with last year’s $350M appropriations
                            estimate and this year’s $870.7M appropriations request causing
                            additional confusion in the interagency arena and on the hill.</p>
                        <p>At this time it appears that it is going to be difficult to arrive at a
                            cost strategy acceptable to Defense, State and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                                >OMB</gloss>, and it is likely that the President will have to
                            resolve the issue. I will stay abreast of the situation for you.<note

                            points:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—I am well aware of the political burden this issue represents for
                                many of you in the House. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the
                                national interest is in keeping the Canal open and running
                                efficiently.</p>
                            <p>—We need your help in explaining to your colleagues and to the
                                American people the advantages of fully implementing our treaty
                                obligations and the disadvantages of failing to do so. No
                                legislation, or bad legislation, could have a serious negative
                                impact on the Canal’s operation—could even close it down for a
                                while.</p>
                            <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack Murphy</persName> has reported out
                                a bill which, though it contains provisions we do not like, would
                                implement the treaty. Our goal now is to get that legislation
                                through the House.</p>
                            <p>—This legislation is basically concerned with Canal management. The
                                Congress is charged with setting the rules which will govern whether
                                it is managed well or badly. I need your advice and assistance to
                                see that the right kind of law is passed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We have been trying to work with <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack
                                Murphy</persName> to develop a strategy for protecting his version
                            of the implementing legislation from further debilitating amendments.
                            This has not been an easy task since <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Murphy</persName> wants to hold the Administration at arm’s length
                            while he works on developing a center-right coalition to support what he
                            would describe as a “Congressional control vs Executive Branch fiat”
                            piece of legislation.</p>
                        <p>While there are serious flaws in <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Murphy</persName>’s bill, we feel the chances of correcting them in
                            the Senate are good. Our goal now is to get his legislation passed on
                            the House floor in as painless a way as possible. To do this we need to
                            develop a core group of bi-partisan supporters who will be willing to
                            participate actively in lobbying colleagues and participating in the
                            floor debate. <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">David Bowen</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DE_1">Ed Derwinski</persName> would be the
                            defacto leaders of this group.</p>
                        <p>Following are some of the political issues we will need help with during
                            the debate:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Treaty standing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though the courts have ruled that the treaties are self-executing and the
                            transfer of property will take place on October 1, even without
                            implementing legislation, many in the House feel they can undermine the
                            treaties by defeating the implementing legislation. Key conservative
                            Members, such as <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Bob Bauman</persName>,
                            have already conceded that the treaties will go into force October 1
                            whatever Congress does and we plan to quote their views on this issue
                            extensively. It is extremely important politically that we get Members
                            over the hurdle of believing that they can undo or renegotiate these
                            treaties. Once they have reconciled themselves, they must then face the
                            consequences of defeating <pb n="530" facs="0565" xml:id="pg_530"
                            />legislation, or enacting legislation that would disrupt the Canal
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Costs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Representative George Hansen has, through some gross misrepresentation
                            and double counting, come up with $4 billion as the cost of treaty
                            implementation. Last year you and Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1"
                                >Alexander</persName> estimated that the cost would be $350 million
                            over the twenty-year life of the treaties. In March of this year,
                            however, we sent to the House data indicating that the cost might be as
                            high as $870 million. This figure was based on high-cost assumptions and
                            it is possible that a review recently commissioned by the President
                            himself will produce yet another estimate, somewhere between the two
                            earlier estimates.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">See <ref target="#d222"
                                    >Document 222</ref>.</note> Chairman Jamie Whitten of the House
                            Appropriations Committee has asked the President to review the matter
                            personally.</p>
                        <p>This cost issue should not be an insuperable one politically. Hansen’s
                            figures make ours seem small by comparison. In addition, it is important
                            to emphasize that these payments do not go to the Panamanian government.
                            Virtually all the additional costs are either for new responsibilities
                            taken over by the Defense Department as a result of the treaties, or for
                            the early retirement benefits for Canal employees.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Hansen Bill</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Our most difficult task will be to defeat the moves of George Hansen to
                            substitute a new bill which would require Panama to pay all
                            implementation costs. If he fails in this ploy, he may move to recommit
                            the legislation. Hansen and his supporters may have a host of other
                            hostile amendments, including:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—No payments to Panama as long as there are outstanding expropriation
                                claims.</p>
                            <p>—Non-implementation of “unconstitutional” parts of the treaties,
                                e.g., Panamanian government members on the Canal Board.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked me to look into the question of Panama Canal treaty
                            implementation costs. As you know, the Administration has been
                            criticized for citing two different estimates in our presentation to the
                            Congress—one of $350 million in February of 1978 and a more recent one
                            of $870 million in March of this year.</p>
                        <p>We have taken a hard look at the $870 million estimate. This figure was
                            originally provided in support of testimony by Under Secretaries
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>. It has since been widely
                            disseminated in media packages, informal discussions, and responses to
                            Congressional staff inquiries. There are a number of adjustments (both
                            plus and minus) which could be made to this estimate, but the net result
                            is a new estimate of $850 million, which is so close to the old $870
                            million that we see no reason to change.</p>
                        <p>However, the $870 million estimate assumes that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> will maintain its <hi rend="italic">full</hi> presence
                            and operation in Panama right up to the year 2000. A gradual phase down
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> presence in Panama is more
                            likely. By assuming a <hi rend="italic">phased</hi> withdrawal for about
                            the last 10 years (1990–2000) the total estimate can be reduced to
                            approximately the $350 million figure provided to the Congress by
                            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1"
                                >Alexander</persName> in February, 1978. The rate and timing of
                            withdrawal can be adjusted to yield whatever final dollar estimate is
                            desired. For example, a 3% annual phase down starting in 1981 would
                            reduce the $870 million figure to $350 million. If this approach is
                            taken, we may be accused of “creative bookkeeping”.</p>
                        <p>The question, therefore, as we see it is whether we should: (1) merely
                            reaffirm the $870 million estimate, or (2) add the “phase down
                            assumption” for a total estimate of $350 million.</p>
                        <p>—$870 million</p>
                        <p>—$350 million</p>
                        <pb n="532" facs="0567" xml:id="pg_532"/>
                        <p>If you prefer, the two concepts can be tied together by indicating that
                            the Administration’s outside estimate is $870 million but that the total
                            costs can be significantly reduced (e.g., to $350 million) by a gradual
                            phasedown in the outyears—situation permitting.<note n="2"

                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know of a better way to wind up a day of
                            delightful legislative work—(Laughter)—than to discuss the Panama Canal
                            Treaty and its implementation.</p>
                        <p>I would like to start out and say a few words as President and then call
                            on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName> to follow
                            me and then General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName>
                            and then Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Ambler Moss</persName>.
                            And following those brief explanations of what issues are involved, to
                            spend the time we have available, I am at your disposal to answer
                            questions that you might have about this very important issue.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate you coming over. I know it has been a hard and long day for
                            you. But there is really no issue that you will address this year that
                            is more difficult or more important than to pass reasonable legislation
                            to implement the treaty. The instruments of ratification went into
                            effect the first day of April. And, as you know, the Panama Canal Zone
                            will come under Panamanian jurisdiction as Panamanian territory on the
                            first day of October. This has already been written into the treaty
                            which is now law. It has been ratified, after a treaty was negotiated
                            for 14 years or more by me and, I think, three other Presidents. And
                            this is an accepted fact that on the first day of October, the Panama
                            Canal Zone will become Panamanian territory under Panamanian
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <pb n="533" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_533"/>
                        <p>The responsibility that we share now, the House, Senate and the
                            President, is to draft and to pass legislation to implement a treaty
                            that is in existence. We have the right under the treaty, carefully
                            negotiated, to operate and defend the canal itself through the year
                            2000. And after that time, our country has the right to continue to
                            defend the canal fairly much as we see fit.</p>
                        <p>The most crucial element of the transition period for the next 20 or so
                            years is to make sure that the canal is operating effectively,
                            efficiently, that it is not in danger of interruption, and that we
                            evolve over that period of time an even stronger sense of partnership
                            and sharing with Panama.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have for many years, many decades, many generations,
                            shared with Panamanian workers there the responsibility for the
                            effective maintenance and operation of the canal itself. And we built
                            into the treaties the proposition that during this transition period, we
                            would continue to work to operate the canal in harmony with one
                            another.</p>
                        <p>I think there has been evolved in the last year or more a mutual respect
                            for one another between ourselves and the people of Panama. There were
                            sharp divisions and concerns raised during the intensely debated treaty
                            ratification time. And I think the exchange of documents when I went to
                                Panama,<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref target="#d183"

                            the visits by General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>

                            Congressional delegations, particularly a large number of Senators—I
                            think almost half the Senate went to Panama to discuss with the leaders
                            there and examine the canal installations and also to discuss future
                            employment and retirement benefits with the American workers, primarily,
                            but also Panamanian workers, to set a basis for proper relationships
                            that are very crucial.<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d129">Document 129</ref> and <ref target="#d130fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 130</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think that all of the military leaders who testified in meetings like
                            these, which were numerous, with the Members of the Senate, or with the
                            public throughout the Nation, indicated accurately that a major factor
                            in the peaceful operation of the canal itself was harmonious
                            relationships with the Panamanians. And that is what we have achieved,
                            and that is what we hope to maintain.</p>
                        <p>I believe that it is important to recognize that you and I have a
                            responsibility to carry out a solemn commitment of the United States of
                            America. Our word of honor is at stake. There have been promises made by
                            the Panamanians and by us. The legal binding promises are spelled out in
                            the technical language in the general terms of the treaty. <pb n="534"
                                facs="0569" xml:id="pg_534"/>But there is a general tone and spirit
                            of the treaties that were evolved after difficult negotiations and when
                            commitments were made on both sides.</p>
                        <p>We have an obligation to meet those commitments. We, in addition, have
                            negotiated with the American employees there. There are certain
                            employment rights, salary levels, retirement terms, benefits after
                            retirement on which the successful operation of the Panama Canal
                            depends. And the good will of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            and Panamanian workers who maintain and operate the canal is a very
                            important element in its proper operation.</p>
                        <p>Any defaulting on the treaty terms and the commitments that have been
                            made would, I think, create serious problems for our country, not only
                            in the violation of a respected nation’s word of honor, but also
                            possible labor unrest or even potential violence that might interrupt
                            the operation of the canal.</p>
                        <p>East Coast oil deliveries from Alaska are dependent upon normal,
                            uninterrupted traffic to the Canal. American shippers, shipping lines,
                            Gulf Coast ports, consumers, farmers and others all depend upon the
                            proper operation of the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>I think it is very important also for us to recognize the need to meet
                            our responsibilities with adequate defense of the Canal itself. The
                            expenses that accrue to our government primarily relate to workers’
                            benefits of all kinds, which I have just described, and the proper
                            deployment and equipping of American military personnel to be sustained
                            there through the year 2000 to guarantee the safety of the Canal
                            operation itself.</p>
                        <p>I recognize perhaps even more vividly than anyone in this room the
                            political consequences of the consummation of the Panama Canal Treaty.
                            When we started our final stage of negotiation, only eight percent of
                            the American people favored the Panama Canal Treaties in any form. About
                            39 Members of the Senate had signed a resolution the year before I
                            became President, committing themselves not to ratify any Panama Canal
                            Treaty. But as the public became aware of the terms of the Treaty and
                            the connotations of it and the consequences of rejection, the benefits
                            of completion of the Treaty terms, a substantial majority approved of
                            the Treaty provided we had the right after the year 2000 to defend the
                            Canal and provided during the rest of this century, for the next 20
                            years, we had the right both to defend and operate the Canal.</p>
                        <p>We gave estimates of the cost of workers’ benefits and defense primarily
                            to the Senate in the early stages of the canal debate last year, as $350
                            million over the next 20 years, roughly 10 years. We didn’t know what
                            premises would be finally written into the implement legis<pb n="535"
                                facs="0570" xml:id="pg_535"/>lation after the final ratification. Of
                            course, we didn’t have time to do accurate projections not knowing the
                            final terms of the legislation.</p>
                        <p>Our latest estimates by the Defense Department are $870 million.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d223fn5">See <ref target="#d222">Documents
                                222</ref>.</note> The Office of Management and Budget have fairly
                            well confirmed these figures. Their figures came out on the same
                            premises to amount to about $850 million, only $20 million
                            difference.</p>
                        <p>I would say over the next 20, 21 years, the average cost per year will be
                            about $42 million. As you know, payments to Panama come out of toll fees
                            and I believe that I can assure you that these figures are accurate to
                            the best of our ability to estimate.</p>
                        <p>There have been wild exaggerations of cost, including all the toll fees
                            and so forth, much higher than this. If we take a period, say, ten years
                            before the termination of our responsibility, the year 1990, and begin
                            to phase down the cost of maintaining our troops at a rate of about
                            three percent per year, which is a reasonable assumption, but it is one
                            we have not yet assumed, then the total cost would be about $350
                            million.</p>
                        <p>But our presumption in reaching the $870 million figure is that we would
                            sustain the present level of American troops adequately deployed and
                            adequately equipped right up to the last day we are responsible for the
                            defense of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>These terms, I think, are fair to our country. I think there are great
                            benefits to be derived from the Treaties themselves. We are obligated, I
                            think, to act in good faith with Panama. I would say that there has been
                            some expression of concern in the House, to answer the last question
                            that I know about, concerning the human rights status as it exists in
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>I think Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName> would
                            agree and General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName>
                            would agree—they live there—that there have been dramatic improvements
                            in Panama in the last year and a half. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has stepped down; a genuine
                            civilian government has been chosen. Panama has signed the
                            Inter-American Human Rights Convention.<note n="6" xml:id="d223fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d102fn3">footnote 3, Document 102</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have seen Panama move toward freedom of the press. The political
                            exiles from Panama have been invited to return and there has been a
                            general improvement there all around.</p>
                        <p>It is not perfect. They don’t measure up yet to American standards, but
                            the objective analysts who have been in Panama would agree, I think,
                            with what I have just described to you.</p>

                        <p>I, as President, want to ask you, without any timidity, to help us evolve
                            within the House an acceptable implementation bill to carry out the
                            terms and the spirit of the treaties that we have negotiated and which
                            the Senate has confirmed and which are now <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> law and international law.</p>
                        <p>I think <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack Murphy</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE_1">Ed Derwinski</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_1">David Bowen</persName> represent three Members of
                            the House who have shown tremendous courage, as have the numerous groups
                            in the Senate. All three of these men, as you know, were opposed to the
                            treaty. They did not want to see the Panama Canal Treaties signed. But I
                            think they have studied the issue and now see that legislation is
                            necessary to carry out the commitment that our Nation has made and to
                            fulfill an oath that you and I both took that we would uphold the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> law.</p>
                        <p>I have to say that there are some elements within the bill which
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack Murphy</persName> is sponsoring
                            that I don’t agree with completely. But I think it is an excellent
                            effort and shows great courage on his part, and I want to thank him for
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I think now I will call on the Secretary of the Army to say a few words
                            and then our Ambassador and then General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName> and then we will open the session for
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are remarks by <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1"
                                >Alexander</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1"
                                >Moss</persName>.]</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, I believe you mentioned in your remarks that the
                            $870 million that you estimate it will cost us now, I believe you said
                            all that would come out in toll fees. Is that correct?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: No. Any payments to Panama will come out of toll fees. The
                            $870 million is designed basically for workers benefits, retirement
                            benefits for our workers, payments to them of an increased nature and
                            the sustaining of our military presence to defend the Canal.</p>
                        <p>The original estimate that was made to the Senate during the early days
                            of the debate was $350 million, before we knew the terms of the
                            legislation and how long all our personnel would stay there and so
                            forth. We have assumed in the $870 million figure that we will maintain
                            the present level of military personnel up to the last day we are in
                            Panama. If we are getting along well with Panama under the military
                            leadership, which will be General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName>’s successor, and, say, in 1990 we start
                            phasing down costs at three percent a year, letting Panama join with us
                            on a cooperative basis, then it will work out to about $350 million.</p>
                        <p>But we are talking about sustaining our military presence up to the last
                            day of 1999. Under those circumstances, we would pay about $42 million a
                            year, which works out roughly to $870 million. That is for our workers
                            and for our defense capability.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Do they make a contributing factor out of the Canal tolls also?
                            Do they pay anything?</p>
                        <pb n="537" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_537"/>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Panama?</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Yes.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Panama has the smallest military force in Central America
                            except Costa Rica, which doesn’t have any military force. And as General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName> said, it is
                            primarily a police force. They have a very tiny National Guard. They are
                            cooperating—and one of the setbacks that we have had was action taken by
                            the House to wipe out a $5 million loan to Panama to let them improve
                            their military, a tiny amount, as you know, to let them join in with the
                            defense. But in kind of a lashing out at Panama to show something, we
                            eliminated that <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> loan to Panama.</p>
                        <p>But we would expect over the next 20 years, slowly but surely Panama will
                            build up their military capability. But in this century, we are directly
                            charged with the primary defense of the Canal. And following the year
                            2000, we have the right to defend the Canal if in the President’s
                            judgment, as Commander-in-Chief, the Panamanians are not defending it
                            adequately.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>If I could follow on, on the question of how much the increased tolls are
                            going to cost us for the payments to Panama, I have had some expression
                            of concern by shipping people in New York City that the increases in the
                            tolls that are contemplated in essence are going to make competitive
                            trans-continental land shipments and, thus, hurt the ports initially in
                            the Gulf and later on, as the tolls go up, along the East Coast,
                            including New York City. I was wondering if you could tell me what
                            increases in the tolls are contemplated and whether your Administration
                            has done any analysis of what the effects of these will be on the
                            Atlantic and Gulf ports?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: We made projections during the Senate debate but let me
                            refer to the Ambassador and Secretary to give you a more accurate answer
                            because I have not kept up with it that much.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">MOSS</persName>: Perhaps
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Alexander</persName> can
                            elaborate on this, too, but under the Administration bill, I understand
                            the Canal company would only be required to raise tolls by 11 percent.
                            This is better than our estimates last year and in fact in 1977 when the
                            treaties were concluded, when sensitivity studies indicated that Canal
                            traffic could reasonably bear an increase of anywhere up to, let’s say,
                            30 percent. Now, there is the question, of course, of how much the
                            traffic should bear, how much the total traffic should bear, and how
                            much the taxpayers should bear additionally to that.</p>
                        <p>For instance, in Chairman Murphy’s bill, the interest payments which are
                            presently made to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Treasury,
                            which have been made for the past 30 years to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Treasury, would be continued, and <pb
                                n="538" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_538"/>that would require a total
                            increase of slightly over 21 percent. Again, well below the figures that
                            we talked about during the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>There have been, of course, other proposals to add in other treaty costs,
                            or extra treaty costs—for instance, some of the early retirement
                            benefits that can be given to our workers—and they were put under the
                            tolls rather than borne by direct appropriations, that would rise a
                            little further.</p>
                        <p>So you start off with kind of a floor, basic treaty, direct treaty
                            related costs, which would cause a toll rise of 14 percent, but then
                            there are, of course, a certain number of add-ons which would represent
                            other funding which could be taken out of the total revenues, if that
                            were the decision of Congress in the implementing legislation.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: That toll fee setting would remain with us.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: There have
                            only been two recent increases in the tolls in the entire history of the
                            canal. They were 19 and 20 percent.</p>
                        <p>Actually, business has continued to rise, the feasibility studies were,
                            as indicated by <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Ambler Moss</persName>,
                            that you could go in the range of the 30 percent area without having a
                            substantial effect on traffic. When you get too much beyond that, it
                            could be—</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, I would like to know, is there any provision for
                            repayment to this country for transfer of property such as the railroad
                            or buildings that will eventually take place in Panama, presently owned
                            by the canal company?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: There is no
                            provision for payment by Panama for the transfer of the railroad, which
                            will take place on treaty day.</p>
                        <p>The provision within the treaty is that the railroad will be transferred
                            without change. It does not at any point establish a certain dollar
                            value for any of the lines or any of the property transferred. For a
                            property not specifically covered by the treaty, if the Panamanians want
                            to have it, they pay the fair market value for it; for example,
                            typewriters.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Anything basically attached to the land will remain?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: That is
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Will remain there, in Panama.</p>
                        <p>Yes?</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, prior to the ratification of the treaty, the
                            anti-American forces within Latin America, especially Central America,
                            use the presence of the United States in order to inflame the
                            anti-American sentiment.</p>
                        <p>What has been the impact of the signing and ratification of the treaty on
                            the anti-American movement, especially in Central America and in the
                            Caribbean?</p>
                        <pb n="539" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_539"/>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I have been to a number of Latin American countries, Bill,
                            and my wife has visited seven of them—seven different countries. I have
                            met in Panama with the leaders of some of the key nations—Venezuela,
                            Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia.<note n="7" xml:id="d223fn7">See <ref
                                    target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note> There has been an
                            outpouring of appreciation and an easing of tension and animosity
                            against our country that has been truly remarkable.</p>
                        <p>It is hard for us as Americans to understand the deep sense that existed
                            in many very friendly Latin American countries that we were still a
                            colonial power. I think that all of the military even agreed, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff were unanimous—I won’t try to speak for General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName>. He is here to
                            speak for himself.</p>
                        <p>But we all felt that the Panamanian government, their limited national
                            guard in spite of extremely inflammatory statements made during the
                            Senate debate—<persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was their
                            chosen leader—was frequently referred to as a tinhorn dictator; racist
                            statements were made against the Panamanians themselves, allegations
                            that they were sub-human or were literally incapable of learning how to
                            operate a valve on the canal or repair the canal.</p>
                        <p>The Panamanians listened to these debates with the same degree of
                            intensity that we watched and listened to the Watergate hearings during
                            their most interesting moments.</p>
                        <p>But in spite of all that, the Panamanian government acted with great
                            sensitivity and the people of Panama showed great restraint.</p>
                        <p>I am not going to get into the argument that we suffered through for six
                            or eight months last year about whether or not we could have defended
                            the Panama Canal if there was an outpouring among the Panamanian people
                            to try to damage it or sabotage it.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs thought we would have had a very serious problem of
                            defending it and would have required perhaps several hundred thousand
                            more troops to enter into combat to do so. But I think there has been a
                            remarkable change in attitude toward the United States of both friendly
                            and previously unfriendly nations because we signed these treaties and
                            we have carried out our agreements under the treaties as best we could,
                            with the exchange of documents and the attitude we have assumed.</p>
                        <p>If there has been any sense of animosity since then, I have not heard
                            about it. Maybe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName>
                            or General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName>, who live
                            there, could correct me if I am wrong.</p>

                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: No, you are
                            absolutely correct, Mr. President. I would like to say something with
                            respect to these elements in Central America.</p>
                        <p>I do have occasion to visit those countries primarily, of course, to talk
                            to the military leaders. But I do keep track of it.</p>
                        <p>I will say briefly that the United States’ action in ratifying the treaty
                            has taken the wind out of the sails of a lot of those anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> elements. They don’t love us for that.
                            But nevertheless, it has denied them a weapon that they had
                            previously.</p>
                        <p>Let me just say categorically to another comment, Mr. President, that I
                            have supported the treaties and the concept of the treaties since I
                            first assumed that command.</p>
                        <p>I was appointed to the command by President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName>. My first tour as a Unified Commander was up about
                            two years ago. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            reappointed me. If I didn’t agree with the treaties that would have been
                            an ideal time for me to retire. But I chose to stay on.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I think the military, so far as I know, the military was
                            unanimous in believing this was a good move.</p>
                        <p>I never heard any adverse reaction among active military persons.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: I would like to follow up again on the scenario, if Congress
                            does not approve implementing legislation—what would the direct result
                            be in Panama and what would the indirect result be in terms of our
                            relationship with Latin American countries?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me repeat what I said earlier, and then let the
                            Secretary and the Ambassador respond more fully.</p>
                        <p>The treaty instruments were exchanged, went into effect the first day of
                            April. The Panama Canal Zone comes under Panamanian jurisdiction on the
                            first day of October, no matter what action the House or Senate might
                            take now.</p>
                        <p>The treaty, as you know, under our Constitution is, the supreme law of
                            the land just like a bill that is passed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary has outlined things that could not happen if we did not
                            pass implementing legislation. There is some doubt about whether we
                            could operate the Canal at all. We would have no authority, for
                            instance, to take care of personnel problems, to continue to employ
                            them, to pay retirement benefits.</p>
                        <p>It would be doubtful unless the Congress would pass some kind of
                            legislation that we could continue to operate military installations
                            there. And the adverse effect on Panama, I think, would be profoundly
                            damaging.</p>
                        <p>But let me turn to, the specific answer, over to the Secretary and then
                            to the Ambassador and let General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName> follow up because <pb n="541" facs="0576"
                                xml:id="pg_541"/>I want this to be very accurate. In fact, any time
                            I make a statement because I haven’t been involved in it for six or
                            eight months that is incorrect, I hope you will all feel free to correct
                            me. Is that clear?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: Certainly,
                            what you stated is completely accurate about all the personnel problems
                            that would flow. Another set of problems is related to the transfer of
                            people to run the hospitals, and run the schools. This could not take
                            place. The setting of tolls could not take place. An increase in tolls
                            would be necessary under any conditions, some have estimated 14—whatever
                            percent, whatever one wants to put on the top. That could not take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>It is questionable what authority the people who are working there would
                            have because the entity known as the Panama Canal Company cannot operate
                            in Panama as of October 1st. That is a fact.</p>
                        <p>So how something could continue to function as the operating entity for
                            the canal is a very serious question. Now what would continue, there are
                            some elements of the Panama Canal Government that continue for a
                            30-month transitional period, like the police and so forth, but they,
                            too, must be placed within a new organizational entity. But many
                            activities would just plain stop.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: We have about 3,000 employees there who are presently
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens living under <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> jurisdiction. And what their rights
                            would be, absent implementing legislation, would be very doubtful. I
                            don’t think the courts have ruled on it yet, but they might become
                                <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Government employees without
                            rights. These matters have not been addressed, and the consequences are
                            so profound, it is almost impossible to assess how serious those
                            consequences would be.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador, add anything you want.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">MOSS</persName>: I want to add
                            one more point to that. I think certainly the Secretary has addressed
                            very fully the organizational problems we have had. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName> and I live down there and
                            spent an awful lot of time talking to the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> citizens. I can tell you, too, we have a very severe
                            morale problem. In fact, I think we have one already because the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens who work down there really
                            expect certain things to happen under the treaty, not only their status
                            in a foreign country, but also the conditions of their employment, their
                            labor organization, this kind of thing. And I can honestly report to you
                            that the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens in the Canal Zone
                            almost unanimously opposed the treaties, there is no doubt about that.
                            But they are almost equally unanimously in favor of this implementing
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>They want to stay there, they love their work, have a high esprit de
                            corps, want to live in Panama. But they want promises fulfilled, want
                            their status defined, want their way of life to continue, want the
                            quality of life to continue as much in the same way as it is now <pb
                                n="542" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_542"/>as humanly possible. And
                            sometimes psychologically, they have a tendency to feel Washington—and
                            they don’t distinguish much between the Legislative and Executive
                            Branches—is out to undercut them or take away the things they were
                            promised.</p>
                        <p>This affects the morale very deeply. Their morale normally on the job is
                            very high. We would like to see it stay that way because it is a very
                            direct factor in how well the canal operates in adverse
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. [unclear] raised the point, too, about how the Latin American
                            countries would see the implementing legislation. I want to point out
                            the canal is terribly important to us because about 7 percent of our
                            international maritime commerce flows through the canal. But it is even
                            more important to some Latin American countries. The West Coast
                            countries of Latin America—Chile, Ecuador, Peru—in each of those cases,
                            over 35 percent of their goods flow through the canal, 25 percent of
                            Columbia, even though it is on two oceans.</p>
                        <p>One of the reasons these countries were outspokenly in support of the
                            treaties was not to be so much anti-American and beat up on the United
                            States, but in their own economic interests, because they felt this was
                            the best way to see their interests preserved. I think a lot of them
                            would view the failure of implementing legislation, or for that matter
                            anything which threatened to disturb the perfect functioning of the
                            canal, as being something which hit them very hard economically and
                            would make a great impact on Latin America, great negative impact, not
                            simply in political ways, but economically it is their lifes’ blood and
                            they would depend very much on that. I think that is something we have
                            to bear in mind.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, I understand that over 60 years ago, we were
                            charging for passage through the canal $1.25 a ton. And now, four wars
                            and 60-some odd years later, we are only charging pennies more. I am
                            troubled if these figures are correct, as to why we can’t make the canal
                            pay for itself and why we can’t raise those $42 million a year out of
                            tolls so it doesn’t cost the American taxpayer.</p>
                        <p>We know that it is a 9,000-mile trek to go around South America, and with
                            fuel costs and crude costs and shipping costs, certainly there is still
                            a great saving on the part of our country as well as other nations of
                            the world if we charged just a fair rate.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: You are
                            certainly accurate in your statements about the dollars per ton that are
                            charged. The only two raises in tolls have come within the last four or
                            five years, and they have been 19 to 20 percent. One could question
                            whether the canal was run like a good business for many years, there is
                            no question about that. But some facts should be pointed out. Since
                            1951, the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Treasury has received
                            $317 million in interest payments. And that is out of <pb n="543"
                                facs="0578" xml:id="pg_543"/>international toll payments. Since
                            1951, the capital improvements have been some $377 million, again out of
                            tolls.</p>
                        <p>Our feasibility studies indicate that there might be a search for
                            alternate routes for the transportation of goods if one went beyond the
                            raising of tolls in and around—I am not precise on this; somebody can
                            correct me—around thirtyish percent. And as you raise it even higher,
                            you eventually reach the point where you lose traffic faster than you
                            gain revenue. We would not want to have a toll, obviously, that is any
                            more than the traffic can bear. But the assumption is that with
                            inflation and running it more as a business should be run, that in the
                            future, you are going to have to raise tolls some more.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, that potential way of transporting goods has to stay
                            competitive. So we don’t want to see tolls go so high that you eliminate
                            the capacity to provide coming revenue.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: But in terms of world inflation, the tolls are a pittance in
                            terms of what they should be. We have no money for countercyclical
                            funds, urban aid and other programs, yet we spend millions of dollars
                            down in Panama. It is hard to explain to my people back home why we
                            can’t have some urban help for the needy, handicapped, senior citizens,
                            underprivileged, yet we are spending $42 million helping the
                            manufacturers of the world.</p>
                        <p>These tolls are very low and certainly from an admitted business
                            viewpoint, an abomination.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">ALEXANDER</persName>: The $42
                            million are not going to the people of Panama. The payments to Panama
                            all come from international shipping. $42 million, which is, again a
                            high side estimate—it is $277 million for five years, that is the best
                            we can get a handle on—go to many of our defense needs, which we would
                            construe to be in our national interests. Obviously there are other
                            defense needs that are made around the world.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the estimates, to make it 870 million, are out-years after
                            the year 1984 that may or may not come to pass, depending on what
                            assumptions you make on force levels. But those $42 million aren’t being
                            transferred from the American taxpayer to the Panamanian government, not
                            at all.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: I realize that. I just wonder if they can defray our costs.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: When you look at the size of the defense budget, $42
                            million sounds like a lot of money, perhaps to a peanut farmer, perhaps
                            to someone in New Jersey. But compared to the total defense budget, it
                            is a relatively small amount. And, of course, one of the insistent
                            demands on the part of the American people, the Senate and myself, was
                            that we retain the right to defend the canal.</p>
                        <p>I think the Panamanians would have been very eager to take over the canal
                            earlier, without giving us a permanent right to defend it and <pb
                                n="544" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_544"/>therefore to arrange to pay for
                            the defense of it themselves, as they will be after the year 2000. But I
                            think that was not only a right but a duty and a privilege, in a way,
                            for us to maintain a military presence in Panama.</p>
                        <p>We not only keep the canal open and secure during this 20-year transition
                            period, but we have a military presence there in the central part of
                            Latin America which can be also beneficial to us.</p>
                        <p>The payments, retirement benefits and pay scales and so forth, of our
                            workers, were negotiated with equal difficulty as we experienced in
                            negotiating with the Panamanians in turning over the canal and the
                            operation of it. Our same negotiators, some of who are here tonight, met
                            with the labor leaders and met with individual American citizens to make
                            sure that after the canal did go over to Panama, that their rights for
                            retirement benefits and so forth were not interrupted. That is where
                            some of that money goes out to. It is a little more expensive to phase
                            out with early retirement and so forth. That is where some of it comes
                            from.</p>
                        <p>I can’t deny there could be an approach which was not written into the
                            treaty and so forth that we would take all the canal tolls and pay for
                            our military presence there. I don’t think that would be fair and it
                            would be in violation of international practice.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, General <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName> talked about the gradual transition to build
                            up the Panamanian forces to where they would be able to protect or
                            defend the canal.</p>
                        <p>In light of the fact—what is the population of Panama, a million and a
                            quarter?</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: About 1.7
                            million.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: So that is about the size of the State of [Georgia], as far as
                            population is concerned.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: A very fine size.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: A very fine size, yes. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>I won’t argue that point, Mr. President. But to support on their economy
                            and through that time, do you really believe that you are going to get
                            an adequate force, considering as a military man, what military presence
                            will be necessary there as an adequate force for whatever eventuality,
                            that the Panamanians will, in fact, be able—through their economy and
                            their numbers—to come up with an adequate force by the year 2000 or will
                            they, in fact, at that point do somewhat as the Philippines and suggest
                            maybe they would like to have us stay on?</p>
                        <p>Would you like to respond to that?</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: First of all,
                            I did say, and I do believe that Panama should and does intend to
                            restructure its forces. It is now three-quarters police and about
                            one-quarter a tactical type of force.</p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_545"/>
                        <p>QUESTION: It is not even equivalent of what we would have as a national
                            guard, though, is it?</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: No. It has
                            very, very minimal military or defense capabilities. But I see them
                            restructuring this force and I see them making a very modest enlargement
                            of the force in order to create, perhaps a couple of battalions, by when
                            is anyone’s guess, 1990—you know, quite a bit down the road.</p>
                        <p>They certainly are not in a position now economically to do any
                            expansion. They are in the position to do a little bit of restructuring
                            so as to dedicate perhaps some symbolic units to canal defense, starting
                            this October, and then gradually to enlarge upon that.</p>
                        <p>As far as what might happen out at the end of the treaty period, many of
                            us have speculated that depending on the attitudes of the United States
                            Government, the Panamanian government, and the situation in Central
                            America on or about the year 2000, I think it is entirely possible that
                            the Panamanian government at that time, might ask the United States to
                            retain a small military presence there after the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>But that is sheer speculation. We have to plan on what is said in the
                            treaty, and that is, that by the year 2000 we will turn over the last
                            remaining military bases and other property that we would have in that
                            canal area and withdraw our forces.</p>
                        <p>Then the full impact of the neutrality treaty comes to bear, as the
                            President indicated, wherein we would perhaps not have forces there but
                            would be permitted to take such actions as would be necessary to
                            maintain neutrality and our continued use of the canal thereafter.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: But would that preclude a United States military presence
                            thereafter?</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: The treaty, as
                            it is written now, would preclude it. In order for forces to stay after
                            the year 2000, some other type of bilateral agreement would have to be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: We would have to negotiate similar as we have done with the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> powers to come in or with the
                            Philippines or whatever—</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION:—under that mutual bilateral agreement and do you feel then on
                            top of that, that is wise for our national security or the relationships
                            in the western hemisphere that the United States have a military
                            presence in Panama thereafter?</p>
                        <p>GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAULIFFE</persName>: I think it is
                            very important for the United States to have military forces in Panama,
                            not only for canal defense but as a deterrent to perhaps possible or
                            potential hostile actions or elements in that area. They do provide an
                            element of stability within <pb n="546" facs="0581" xml:id="pg_546"/>the
                            country of Panama and within the region. I think that so long as we have
                            forces in Panama, they serve as a deterrent to a possible predatory
                            nation thinking about coming in and taking advantage of the situation in
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>That is down to the year 2000. As I said, it is very difficult to predict
                            what would be the requirement of the situation beyond that. And I think
                            we just have to—our successors will have to see.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: But my question was related as to whether we feel our position
                            was to try to negotiate at that point a bilateral agreement for
                            presence.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: I will say this: In the latter part of the Senate debate
                            on the treaty, I would have stolen $10 from Amy’s piggy bank and paid
                            the Panamanians to say you could stay after the year 2000 with just one
                            batallion of American troops. I don’t know what is going to happen. I
                            think it primarily depends on our relationship with Panama. If you don’t
                            mind my being critical, you know, Panama is our friend. They are our
                            neighbor. They are symbolic in many ways to the other Latin American
                            countries [and] the Caribbean countries, as a test of how the United
                            States is going to implement our professed commitment to basic human
                            rights, a powerful nation in every sense of the word, how do we deal
                            with a small nation that has been heavily dependent upon us and which
                            has negotiated in good faith under the most difficult of circumstances
                            to work out an agreement that is mutually satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>We send billions of dollars to Israel, to Egypt, tens of millions of
                            dollars to countries like <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName>,
                            Syria, Thailand and so forth. Here is Panama, you know, a neighbor,
                            friend, a partner alongside of us in the wars; they never have abandoned
                            us. It has been difficult for them. And just a few weeks ago when we had
                            proposed, I think a $5 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit so Panama could borrow some money—it was not a grant—to build up
                            their national guard so they could be more capable, the House cut it
                            off, just wiped out $5 million, a drop in the bucket for you, but
                            symbolically it was a slap in the face to Panama.</p>
                        <p>You know, we have proven that we are powerful enough to do it. Maybe it
                            helped politically back home to say, “I showed the Panamanians.” But you
                            know, we have got to work with Panama and I don’t believe it is good for
                            us to show that we are powerful enough to punish a little nation just
                            because we disagree with the negotiated treaty that was signed by me and
                            ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>I would hope that you would take that into consideration.</p>
                        <p>One of the best ways to defend the Panama Canal is not for us to send
                            100,000 more troops down there, but to have a friendly relationship with
                            Panama so they will join in with us in a cooperative and <pb n="547"
                                facs="0582" xml:id="pg_547"/>friendly spirit to help defend the
                            canal that we and they both want to be kept open.</p>
                        <p>I know it is a difficult vote. If I was in the House, I would be going
                            through the same difficult decision-making that you are. But I hope that
                            you will recognize that generosity or fairness is a crucial element in
                            foreign diplomacy and help us not to try to punish Panama even though
                            you decide not to vote with implementing legislation. Let’s don’t turn
                            those people against us and make it almost impossible for General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName> and our military
                            troops to defend it.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, I certainly support the treaty, but on a certain
                            matter here, for example, it says, “The Panama Canal Treaties provide
                            the United States with the necessary authority at the time of war to
                            defend and secure the canal.” I wonder if you could tell us a little bit
                            about who decides whether it is a war and whether it is the kind of war
                            in which we would move? Suppose it were one of these wars which is kind
                            of hard to decide whether it is a war or revolution?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: The President of the United States decides. If, in his
                            judgment—or perhaps her judgment—at that time the Panama Canal is in
                            danger, if the security is in danger, the United States has a right to
                            take such action as it deems necessary to defend the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: They don’t regard this as an invasion of their sovereignty?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Not only has Panama agreed with this provision—that was
                            the most difficult single negotiating point—but other nations in that
                            region have also endorsed that principle. And the treaty that is
                            continues after the year 2000 has a multinational protocol throughout
                            which countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico can join with us as
                            signatories to make sure that not only does Panama agree we have a right
                            to defend, but we have a duty to defend. But other nations who would be
                            sensitive also agree to respect the neutrality of the canal; it will be
                            a written, signed international document. And Panama, if they disagree
                            with a judgment made by the President, as Commander-in-Chief, they have
                            to refer to the agreement that the Panama Canal is kept open by
                            unilateral action, if necessary, on the part of the United States.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: I support the implementation of the treaty, Mr. President. Even
                            more do I support your conception of what the honor of a great country
                            is in dealing with a smaller country. I think those are words that we
                            must remember.</p>
                        <p>I would like to ask you about how this new President is installed, if not
                            by election. What is going on by way of their electoral process and
                            governmental change?</p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_548"/>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you what I recollect, which is kind of short,
                            and let the Ambassador correct me.</p>
                        <p>Last August they had an election to choose a General Assembly—I think
                            about 500 members. And then those 500 members chose the President. And I
                            understand that in 1984 there will be direct elections of the President,
                            similar to what we have.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">MOSS</persName>: That is
                            absolutely right.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is a portion of the question and answer session.]</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, I think that probably the most serious question
                            we are going to have to answer during these entire debates is the
                            question of how much our property is worth there, just as you are
                            talking about, and why we are not going to take that portion of the
                            operation of the canal that is for our additional personnel costs,
                            excluding our military, out of the tolls that Panama is going to get,
                            why we are not going to get them to pay us back for the equipment, for
                            anything that we are leaving for them, to acquire all the properties and
                            pay for our additional costs.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that would be a very substantial burden to ask them to do,
                            but that is the issue that we are really going to be facing. All these
                            other things we can talk about, but the real issue is whether we are
                            going to, in effect, require that the tolls from Panama to require for
                            the $4 billion worth of whatever our inventory is there.</p>
                        <p>I think that is the real issue, and I think it is going to be a difficult
                            issue for us to face, because I think the people back home are from
                            concerned about us turning that over without requiring them to pay us
                            for it and at the same time increase their toll payments so
                            substantially.</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me give you two quick answers and let the Ambassador
                            follow up. In the first place, we have never claimed sovereignty over
                            the Panama Canal Zone, neither Teddy Roosevelt nor the Supreme Court in,
                            I think, five different rulings, nor anyone else in a position of
                            authority, including no Presidents have ever claimed we had sovereignty
                            over the Canal Zone during the 75 years or so we have used it. It has
                            been Panamanian territory. We have not paid them much rent on it, but we
                            have used it.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary pointed out, we have derived since 1957, as so-called
                            interest payments on our original investment, over $317 million which
                            has come up here and gone into the United States Treasury. I think that
                            was fair. I think that we benefited, I think that Panama benefited. It
                            was not a favor done by either person, by either nation.</p>
                        <p>To answer your question, if we could have written the treaty unilaterally
                            without negotiating it with Panama, a sovereign nation, we could have
                            made any demand we chose. We could have confiscated all the tolls,
                            figured out how much all of our buildings cost, made Panama pay for it
                            and not given them anything.</p>
                        <pb n="549" facs="0584" xml:id="pg_549"/>
                        <p>But we negotiated with them over 14 years, beginning with Lyndon
                            Johnson—I am the fourth President—in a quid pro quo relationship, where
                            both countries ostensibly, and I think actually, derived benefit. The
                            treaty does not call for Panama to pay us for those facilities out of
                            tolls. It specifically prescribes what we have outlined to you tonight.
                            And we are now living under an agreement signed by me, ratified by the
                            Senate, which does not call for Panama to pay for those facilities that
                            we are turning over to them.</p>
                        <p>We can’t renegotiate the treaty. We can’t reject it under international
                            law or under United States law. I am sworn to uphold the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> law, <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Constitution, just like you are. And there is no way
                            for us to undo the treaty that we have ratified.</p>
                        <p>If we discovered at this point that we had made a serious mistake,
                            because of a major oversight, or if the Panama Government had been
                            overthrown by a radical communist dictator, instead of being taken over
                            by a democratically-chosen, friendly President, we still are bound to
                            carry out the terms of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>We can’t undo the treaty. It has already gone into effect. So to raise
                            this question now, why don’t they pay us for it, that was not the
                            agreement we reached. We signed the agreement just like a contract to
                            sell land.</p>
                        <p>If you bought a piece of farmland for $400 an acre and you discovered oil
                            on it, the former owner couldn’t come back and say, “It is worth
                            $100,000 an acre. I want my land back.” The same thing is basically the
                            question you are asking. You have to be fair with the people once you
                            traded with them. That is what we did. We traded with them, signed the
                            document. I think it was fair and is fair the way it has been worked
                            out.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">MOSS</persName>: Let me add that
                            on the Panamanian side, of course, there was tremendous opposition to
                            the treaties for almost the equal and opposite reason there was
                            opposition here. The Panamanian people, many of them, thought their
                            country had given away too much and in fact they should have gotten a
                            better economic bargain.</p>
                        <p>They pointed out over the years we paid $2.3 million for the use of about
                            600 square miles of territory, some of their best real estate, and it
                            works out to about $6.00 an acre a year. And at the present, we are
                            paying ourselves $20 million a year interest payment and they are only
                            getting 2.3 million. Their economy benefits enormously from the canal,
                            but still when they consider that they look around the world and see
                            what we pay for military base rights in Spain, Turkey, Philippines, and
                            we are keeping our bases for the next 20 years without any quid pro quo
                            for the bases, a lot of Panamanians have criticized their own government
                            for not driving a harder bargain.</p>
                        <pb n="550" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_550"/>
                        <p>These negotiations were genuine arms length negotiations, tough
                            negotiations, and as the President said, it is the way the bargain
                            finally came out. I think the proof of the fact it is a fair bargain is
                            the fact it did generate so much heat in both countries for the equal
                            and opposite reasons.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Mr. President, what you are saying, as I understand it, is we
                            can’t re-open the treaty negotiations, which I think we all understand,
                            that we either have got to take and accept one way or the other, or
                            reject, what you have proposed here as far as what you have already
                            obligated to the President as soon as it is ratified. Is that about
                            it?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, except I would say that <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Jack Murphy</persName>’s bill, which we are supporting and hope
                            will not be modified, is not exactly what we want. If I were writing the
                            bill myself, I would write it differently. I think that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Jack</persName>’s bill is not quite fair enough
                            to Panama, and I think it borders on violating the spirit of the
                            agreement that I negotiated.</p>
                        <p>But we are supporting it, and I think that <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1"
                                >Jack</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DE_1">Ed
                                Derwinski</persName> and others are very courageously supporting it.
                            But we can’t violate our word of honor, we can’t violate the law of the
                            land, which is the treaty. And I would hope you all would support the
                            implementing legislation, including the spirit in which the treaty was
                            negotiated, although you might find some loophole in the treaty that you
                            could take advantage of if you wanted to abuse Panama.</p>
                        <p>The last point is if the House does not act favorably and pass
                            legislation, then we are faced with a serious debacle the first of
                            October, because the whole thing goes to Panama, they have jurisdiction
                            over it, and we don’t have any mechanism by which we can continue to
                            operate.</p>
                        <p>QUESTION: Regardless of what we do. Right?</p>
                        <p>THE PRESIDENT: Regardless of what we do.</p>
                        <p>I want to thank you all for being so patient.</p>

                            It is quite possible that the House of Representatives may pass a bill

                            military assistance to Panama which Congress had cut. The problem was
                            that the House of Representatives used that to express its displeasure
                            with its inability to vote on the Canal Treaties. However, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he thought

                            consummate the treaties in a fair and acceptable form. He reminded

                            treaties looked hopeless, he redoubled his efforts. Furthermore,

                            viewed his pledge to Panama to be fair and generous and cooperative and
                            still binding on him. There will be some problems in the future. For
                            example, he will have to negotiate the transfer of movable property, and
                            we may have a specific law to deal with this. If so, we will try to
                            assess the property at a low <pb n="554" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_554"
                            />but fair price. With regard to the tugs that serve the canal, our
                            first priority is to have these continue to serve the canal, but we also
                            hope that they will be able to serve the ports under an agreement which
                            would be acceptable both to Panama and to the tugs’ owners. Our
                            inclination is to keep the relationship undisturbed. (C)</p>

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName> is working very

                            he was called a traitor by his people and even “a bastard.” But he said

                            realizes that a sensitive job needs to be done, and that Panamanians
                            know that in the end the issue will be resolved, and so it does not make
                            any sense to talk about it any further now. “We need to go forward with
                            other issues, rather than just be concerned about the assistance.” On

                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> made the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—On <hi rend="italic">Nicaragua</hi>, he said that as a result of his
                            conversation with you and his meetings on the Hill, he believes the
                            risks to the implementing legislation and to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Panamanian relations is too great to consider any
                            further assistance to the Sandinistas. (C)</p>
                        <pb n="558" facs="0593" xml:id="pg_558"/>
                        <p>—On the <hi rend="italic">Non-Aligned Movement</hi>, he reiterated his
                            pledge to you to speak in Havana about the new relationship between the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Panama which is the result of
                            the treaties. He welcomes follow-up briefings by us on the specific
                            issues, and we will be doing that soon. (C)</p>
                        <p>—On the <hi rend="italic">implementing legislation</hi>, he said he would
                            be helpful in any way you wanted, and would return to Washington to
                            speak to Congressmen and Senators if you so requested. He was worried
                            that our strategy of waiting for the Senate to correct the “violations”
                            of the House could backfire since he feels that many Senators believe
                            that they have already done their duty for the treaties and do not want
                            to “get bloodied” a second time. (C)</p>
                        <p>—On <hi rend="italic">his meeting with you</hi>, he was extremely
                            pleased. He admitted that while he had some doubts at times about the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, he had full trust and faith in
                            you as a moral leader and a friend of his and Panama’s. (He asked that
                            his comments on the School of the Americas in his conversation with you
                            be kept in strict confidence, or it could cause him serious problems at
                            home.) (C)</p>
                        <p>—On the <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> investment team to Panama</hi>,
                            he has asked <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis</persName> to
                            coordinate Panama’s side. They are looking forward to it. (C)</p>

                                Panamanian complicity with Sandinistas” and as revealing the “true

                            raised in House debate on implementing legislation on May 21. We expect
                            this to continue and perhaps even intensify during coming weeks,
                            particularly when House resumes consideration of legislation.</p>
                        <p>(C) There have been a number of discussions in the past with him and with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> on the general
                            question of Nicaragua and Panama’s role therein. From those
                            conversations, we drew the conclusion that Panama shared our view with
                            respect to the necessity to find a peaceful solution in Nicaragua both
                            because it was desirable for the sake of that country and because of the
                            danger that some action might lead to an extension of the conflict. We
                            hope <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> continues to share that
                            general view.</p>
                        <p>(D) Because of the press and other allegations of Panamanian involvement
                            in arms deliveries to the Sandinistas which grew out of the Miami case
                            in which five persons were indicted, we greatly appreciate having
                            received word of <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>’s decision
                            to authorize an investigation to determine whether there was any
                            violation of Panamanian law. We assume that such investigation will
                            encompass all aspects of the Miami case including those arms which were
                            exported legally to Panama but which were intercepted by the Nicaraguan
                            National Guard. We hope that <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>
                            will broaden that investigation should other cases emerge or come to his
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>(E) We hope that these matters will not have a serious effect on the
                            implementing legislation in either the Senate or the House. We also hope
                            that Panamanian cooperation will enable us to continue to resist
                            congressional pressures to limit assistance to Panama.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Ambler Moss</persName> and I
                            arrived in Cantadora Island (off Panama) for five full hours of talks
                            with Torrijos. On Tuesday,<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">June 5.</note> we
                            met with President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The objectives we set for ourselves were: (1) to calm <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> down and try to persuade him
                            not to escalate his involvement in the Nicaraguan civil war, as he
                            hinted he would do; and (2) to seek assurances, preferably in writing
                            from <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>, that Panama would not
                            involve itself in Nicaragua’s affairs. We were skeptical of achieving
                            the second objective since we were informed before arriving by Bill
                            Rogers, who had spoken with <persName corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel
                                Lewis</persName>, that Torrijos’ objective was to try to get the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to recognize the Sandinista Front
                            when it established a provisional government in Nicaragua as he expected
                            it to do soon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> began by saying that he
                            regretted that because the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> always
                            seemed so slow to recognize new realities we hadn’t bothered to “buy a
                            share” of Sandinista stock. He said he believed the Sandinistas would
                            triumph, perhaps in a matter of days. I countered by saying that we had
                            come to Panama not to buy Sandinista stock but to try to get Panama to
                            sell its stock. This divergence in perspective characterized much of our
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>In sorrow as well as anger, I said that our two governments had worked in
                            such a painstaking way over 2½ years to negotiate and ratify the Canal
                            Treaties and to develop a new relationship based on mutual respect and
                            non-intervention. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> had invested his prestige in this effort, which
                            most Americans either didn’t understand or opposed. As we approached the
                            last and in some ways the most difficult stage—the implementing
                            legislation—in our journey, Panama seemed to be doing everything to
                            jeopardize the treaties. I told him that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> hearings and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> meeting called by Nicaragua were
                            intended to scuttle the treaties by tying Panama to the Sandinistas. <pb
                                n="564" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_564"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> and Sevilla Sacosa would
                            try to show that Panama had violated their sacred principle of
                            non-intervention, that Panama was aiding the communists, and that Panama
                            was not a reliable partner. Passing the legislation was a difficult
                            enough task in itself; playing with the Sandinistas could make a
                            difficult task impossible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that he had never
                            trusted <persName corresp="#p_MJM_1">Murphy</persName> and thought we
                            were foolish to have trusted him. <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1"
                                >Somoza</persName> had warned <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that either Panama would help Nicaragua, or it
                            would lose the implementing legislation. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> said he was not prepared to make a pact with
                            the devil. I told him that he didn’t have to support <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName>; all we were asking was that he
                            not try to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> continually tried to
                            pull me into a discussion on Nicaragua, but I insisted at the beginning
                            that we deal with the implementing legislation. Finally, in frustration,
                            he said: “I am out of the Canal Treaty business.” Because of his
                            friendship for <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, he said
                            he wanted to make sure we were aware how directly our interests would be
                            affected by a Sandinista victory. He seemed sincere in his statement
                            that he didn’t want to cause problems for us or anyone, and was prepared
                            to leave Panama for a year if we wanted him to.</p>
                        <p>(Personal comment: He said that, I believe, in order to support his point
                            that he wasn’t trying to push us to do everything. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was curiously withdrawn. I
                            had expected him to try to push us into a new position on the
                            Sandinistas, but, on this occasion, that was neither his purpose nor his
                            style. Rather it set out his view of developments, and it was <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH_1">Ambler</persName> and I doing the lobbying.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> was joined, after a
                            time, by Marcel Salaman, a very intelligent “political scientist” who
                            serves as his personal representative to the Sandinistas, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Gabriel Lewis</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_COL_1">Col</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Noriega</persName> (his Chief of Intelligence), and Panama’s
                            military attache in Managua. All painted a picture of a rapidly
                            deteriorating situation in Nicaragua. They showed us letters from
                            several National Guard leaders who defected and sought asylum in Panama.
                            They believe that the Sandinistas have begun a general offensive which
                            will be joined by a general strike in Managua and will lead soon to the
                            downfall of <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName> and the
                            installation of a transition government dominated by the moderate
                            opposition and the Terciario faction (the more pragmatic, less
                            ideological faction) of the Sandinistas. I told them that I believed
                            this second cycle of violence would see more fighting and deaths than
                            last September, but that <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName>
                            would prevail. However, after this cycle, <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1"
                                >Somoza</persName> might finally come to realize that he will never
                            defeat the Sandinistas and the longer he blocks a political solution the
                            more likely a Sandinista “military solution” will occur. Then, the
                            democracies in the hemisphere will need to assist the people of
                            Nicaragua to find a political solution. I said that we are reviewing our
                            policy, that we would be sending a new Ambassador <pb n="565"
                                facs="0600" xml:id="pg_565"/>to Managua soon,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d230fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLA_1">Lawrence A. Pezzullo</persName>.</note>
                            and that I expected we would be adopting a more active role to try to
                            work with other nations in the region in a constructive and collective
                            effort to resolve the Nicaragua crisis.</p>
                        <p>Salaman compared the situation in Nicaragua to that of Iran. In both
                            cases, he said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> was too slow to
                            see or act on the imminent downfall of a dynasty. In both cases, we
                            failed to understand or recognize the many dimensions of the opposition
                            (i.e. Sandinista opposition) and therefore failed to exploit the
                            differences between the opposition. Even today, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has not established a liaison at the
                            policy level with the Sandinistas. When we finally agreed to speak to
                            Eden Pastora, for example, we sent an intelligence agent to
                            “interrogate” him rather than a policy-level person to dialogue with
                            him. The Panamanians asked if we would meet with several Sandinista
                            leaders, and we said we wouldn’t. They said that even the Chamber of
                            Commerce in Managua recognized the divisions in the Sandinistas and were
                            providing financial support to the Terciarios. If we couldn’t meet with
                            some Sandinistas, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> asked
                            if we would consider having an American intermediary like Bill Rogers
                            meet with them on our behalf.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> bluntly whether
                            Panama was sending arms directly or indirectly to the Sandinistas or
                            whether Panama was helping Cuba send Sandinistas back to Nicaragua to
                            fight. (We have some evidence of both.)<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> denied both charges
                            flatly. I asked him three times whether he would convey his assurances
                            of Panamanian non-intervention in Nicaragua’s internal affairs in a
                            letter to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and
                            whether he would ask President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> to do the same. At 12:30 a.m., on the third try,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said he would send
                            such a letter.</p>
                        <p>But before doing so, he wanted to know whether we would be as diligent in
                            seeking an end to intervention by El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
                            to bolster <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName> as we were in
                            seeking the termination of assistance to the Sandinistas. We informed
                            him that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had already made
                            demarches to those governments and had received assurances from them,
                            but that we would repeat demarches during this period of crisis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> pressed me very
                            hard for signs of a double standard or lingering support for <persName

                            recommended a collective and a legitimate, overt effort to solve the

                            Nicaragua—Sandinista rebellion. We think he was able to field the
                            questions reasonably well considering the hostile intent. His basic
                            approach was that General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1"

                            that does not indicate that Panama is an unreliable and trouble-making
                            partner or cannot be trusted with gradually assuming control of the
                            Panama Canal. The Committee requested a special classified hearing today
                            for Members only. At best this series of hearings offers us no
                            advantages; it will surely be used to attack the Panama Canal

                            that we should not overestimate Torrijos’s influence with the <gloss

                                >FSLN</gloss> we have in mind for him. Parenthetically, I don’t
                            think any Panama Canal “cover” would hold, or that <persName

                            it.</p>
                        <p>(B) We need to work with several other Latin American leaders (Canazo,

                        <p>(D) A visit by General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            might well produce expectations that the excellent personal relations
                            between the President and the General could cause <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> to work effectively for a
                            policy close to our original proposals. Quite frankly, I doubt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would have the will
                            to proceed along these lines, and we should not try to get him to
                            support ideas that will no longer work.</p>
                        <p>(E) Finally, I question recommending a visit by <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> at a time when the President
                            is returning early to attend to urgent domestic problems, such as the
                            energy situation and the truckers’ strike. An inconclusive meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> would not help
                            either the situation in Nicaragua or the President himself.</p>
                        <p>2. To be weighed against these negative factors is the great affection
                            and regard that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has for
                            the President. He would be complimented by a visit and probably inspired
                            to try to be more helpful. I think, however, that we can get most of the
                            advantages of this relationship by a message, without having to absorb
                            what I see as, on balance, greater disadvantages.</p>

                        <p>3. We are sending our thoughts on how we might proceed in Nicaragua in a
                            separate message.<note n="5" xml:id="d236fn5">The message is scheduled

                            work with Torrijos—as well as other Latin American leaders—to shape
                            events in the days to come, but only if we accept the fact that a
                            provisional government—and not an executive council—is likely to replace
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGA_1">Somoza</persName> in Managua. We will
                            be sending you our ideas on how we might be able to expand and shape the
                            presently constituted provisional government and perhaps extract
                            conditions from it; but I have come to the conclusion that we must work
                            with others to modify this body if we are to have any impact on the
                            course of events.</p>

                            that it is not implausible. Any thought by Torrijos—even a gleam in the
                            eye—of getting involved in the Belize issue as he did in Nicaragua
                            should therefore be discouraged promptly; especially so if there is any
                            suggestion of cooperation with Cuba in that regard.</p>

                            recently and regularly flying from Panama to Belize City.” Can the

                        <p>—Recognizing the desirability of a resolution of the Belize issue, we do
                            not think that anything should occur which encourages confrontation as a
                            way to solve it.</p>
                        <p>—The emphasis should be on encouraging the UK and Guatemala to negotiate
                            it out.</p>
                        <p>—Above all we would hope that no one would be tempted to supply any kind
                            of material support (or personnel) to the Belizeans; this could only
                            stimulate confrontation and tempt the Belizeans to believe they could
                            meet the issue with force.</p>
                        <p>—You may mention that there are rumors—and consequent concern—in
                            Guatemala to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is
                            doing something of this sort. We are sure this is not true.</p>
                        <p>—Above all Cuba should be discouraged from any role in the Belizean
                            issue; we hope the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> will do so if
                            there is any indication that Cuba is tempted to involve itself.</p>
                        <p>—Obviously any kind of external involvement by anyone ala Nicaragua would
                            not be tolerated by the UK, and would require a serious response by
                            us.</p>

                            take—corporate versus appropriated fund agency. House staffers have

                            law before October 1. We will be very active in Congress next week to
                            obtain a better result before the weekend, and to get on track the
                            authorization and appropriations legislation required. These await
                            action on the implementing legislation.</p>
                        <p>It is of course possible that we may not have implementing legislation by
                            October 1. In this event we have two alternatives. We can either shut
                            down the Canal and keep the pressure on Congress to complete the
                            legislation, or keep the Canal open without it. As to the latter, the
                            most serious problem would be to spend funds for Canal operations and
                            payments to Panama without appropriations. We have been working with
                            Justice on a contingency plan giving us some legal justification to do
                            this on an emergency basis.</p>
                        <p>The October 1 observance will of course go ahead in any event, since the
                            Treaty comes into effect regardless of Congressional action. Obviously
                            the circumstances would be considerably more difficult in that
                            event.</p>

                        <p>The White House is asking Cabinet Secretaries to call a portion of our
                            target list on the Panama Implementing Legislation. Realizing your
                            schedule, I have kept your list to a bare minimum. If at all possible, I
                            would appreciate your calling the following Republicans who had
                            previously voted for final passage but who switched on the Conference
                            Report: Hamilton Fish, Peggy Heckler, Bob McClory, and Jim
                                Jeffords.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> underlined “Hamilton
                                Fish,” “Bob McClory,” and “Jim Jeffords.” An unknown hand

                        </p>
                        <p>I would suggest the following talking points:</p>
                        <p>—We must pass this legislation if we are going to avoid a disastrous
                            situation on October 1. We need your support.</p>
                        <p>—I expect that some changes will be made in the Conference Report which
                            will go even further in the House’s direction than the bill voted on the
                            other day. For example, we understand that the new Conference Report
                            will prevent the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> from relinquishing
                            the Canal before the end of the century (a <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                                >Bauman</persName> concern), and will ensure that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> recovers every cost associated with
                            Treaty implementation permitted under the Treaty’s terms (another
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Bauman</persName> concern).</p>
                        <p>—Passage of this Legislation is vital to our national security interests
                            and to our foreign policy in Latin America.</p>

                        <p>As a result of lengthy meetings between staffs and principals, the
                            House-Senate Conference on the Panama implementing legislation reached
                            agreement on further changes. The result appears to be satisfactory to
                            all or almost all the conferees. Congressman <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE_1">Bauman</persName> opined that the current version
                            represented about all that the House could get. He signed the report but
                            refused to indicate he would vote for the bill in the House, limiting
                            himself to stating that he would inform the membership it was the best
                            possible deal.</p>
                        <p>The new version will include the following:</p>
                        <p>1. A provision to prevent the President from transferring the Canal
                            itself and certain associated property to Panama before the year
                            2000.</p>
                        <p>2. A provision to ensure that all Treaty implementation costs associated
                            with the operation and maintenance of the Canal are paid before Panama
                            can receive any of its contingent annuity. (It was stated during the
                            colloquy that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> defense costs are not
                                included.)<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> highlighted the
                                first three paragraphs and wrote in the right margin on September
                                25: “Used in call to John Rhodes today—very helpful.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Satisfactory language on the wartime control issue, virtually as
                            agreed last week, but with a stipulation in the report that if foreign
                                <pb n="585" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_585"/>forces—i.e., Soviet or
                            Cuban—were stationed in Panama, this would be deemed a threat to the
                            security of the Canal and would lead to <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military control.</p>
                        <p>4. A provision that three of the five <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Directors must come from private life, and a provision
                            that one member must be drawn from each of three interest groups—ports,
                            shipping and labor. What is new is that either private or public members
                            could serve to represent these interest groups.</p>
                        <p>5. The previously agreed, redundant provision that the President should
                            not accept the retroactive taxation of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> businesses, non-profit organizations and individuals
                            now located in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>The leadership hopes to get a special rule in the House, waiving the
                            three-day rule for the consideration of the Conference Report. If this
                            is successful, House debate could take place Wednesday<note n="3"

                        <p>I have recently signed the documents proclaiming and making public the
                            Panama Canal Treaty and the Neutrality Treaty, “to the end that they

                                xml:id="d245fn2">On September 27, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> signed into law the Panama Canal Act of 1979.
                                For the text of his statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers:
                                    Carter</hi>, <hi rend="italic">1979</hi>, Book II, pp.

                        </p>
                        <p>The historic date is upon us. It will be memorable on several counts: for
                            Panama, which achieves long held national aspirations, for the United
                            States, which has dedicated the engineering marvel of the Panama Canal
                            to the service of international commerce among all nations, and for the
                            Canal itself, whose multinational workforce has set extraordinary
                            standards of excellence in the construction, maintenance and operation
                            of the waterway which parts the Hemisphere but unites the world.</p>
                        <p>Just as the Canal builders faced and overcame seemingly intractable
                            obstacles and discouraging setbacks, Americans and Panamanians have
                            prevailed in constructing a new Canal relationship which serves the
                            national interests of our two countries and the needs of international
                            maritime commerce. The task before us now is to broaden and deepen that
                            relationship and keep it free from obstacles or threats which would
                            block its purpose. The United States is as committed to making these
                            Treaties work as we were to building the Canal itself.</p>
                        <p>Because of the pride which I have in the achievement of the Canal
                            Treaties and our 75 years of involvement with the Canal, I have asked
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Walter Mondale</persName> to
                            represent the United States during the ceremonies marking the entry into
                            force of the Canal Treaties. Rosalynn and I regret that we will not be
                            able to join you personally.</p>
                        <p>With my personal regards to you as an architect of our joint endeavor, I
                            remain</p>

                            authorization:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—to propose to the White House our slates for the Consultative

                                the Panama Canal Treaty;</p>
                            <p>—to request the White House to include a State Department member on
                                the Panama Canal Commission’s Board of Directors;</p>
                            <p>—and to continue to press for full Embassy participation in the
                                Coordinating Committee and the Joint Committee, locally-appointed
                                liaison bodies dealing with technical matters of Treaty
                                implementation.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>We had hoped that our differences with Defense on the latter two subjects
                            would be resolved at the Friday<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">September
                                28.</note> morning White House meeting. Unfortunately, the subject
                            was not discussed.</p>
                        <p>Since the Treaty goes into effect on Monday, October 1, we must proceed
                            urgently to minimize the delay imposed upon us by the absence until
                                Thursday<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">October 4.</note> of
                            implementing legislation, and by State-Defense disagreements.
                            Accordingly, I hope we can now move ahead with the Presidential
                            appointments on which Defense has no objections, and as a separate
                            matter, visibly maintain our position on the issues in dispute, so that
                            they may be resolved quickly.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that you authorize us to forward to the White House
                            immediately our nominations for the <hi rend="italic">Consultative
                                Committee</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Joint Commission on the

                            While <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> does not favor the nomination

                            the Consultative Committee, it is informed of our intentions and is not
                            likely to raise an objection, since it considers this committee a
                            diplomatic forum which is principally a <pb n="588" facs="0623"

                            on the Board. He considered it pointless, since Board Members are
                            obligated to vote at the direction of the Secretary of Defense, and
                            opined that it would result in bickering, appeals to <gloss

                        <p>We continue to feel that State membership is required. The Board’s
                            activities will bear directly and importantly on our ongoing
                            relationships with Panama. The Panamanian members are outstanding public
                            figures who have participated in Treaty negotiations. The voting
                            requirement is essentially irrelevant to our position: a State presence
                            on the Board is needed to prevent the American membership bloc, which
                            Congress has structured predominantly to reflect private interests, from
                            precipitating needless and potentially injurious controversies with
                            Panama as a result of Board deliberations. We hope you will maintain

                            President reaffirmed the intention of the two countries to be guided by
                            the Panama Treaties in their action, and both expressed confidence in
                            successful Treaty implementation and the future of the Panamanian-<gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> expressed concern regarding
                            the Cuban military <pb n="590" facs="0625" xml:id="pg_590"/>build-up,
                            stating that the Latin American armies considered the Cuban Army
                            aggressive in design. On Nicaragua, <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName> urged we provide not only food and economic
                            assistance but also non-lethal military help and technical assistance.
                            At the moment, he said, the moderates were in the stronger position in
                            Nicaragua, but they needed help to withstand radical forces. The Vice
                            President said we understood the need and wanted to work through the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and Latin American
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>After amenities, President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>
                            explained that his remarks regarding the implementing legislation had
                            been misquoted.<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> He did not say that the legislation violated the
                            Treaty. He did say that Panama intended to act in accordance with the
                            Treaty, which was its guiding criterion.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said the Treaty was also the foundation of our action.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> understood our
                            constitutional processes—no one by now knew them better—and he and other
                            Panamanian leaders had shown remarkable restraint despite severe
                            provocation. Some of the harsh statements had undoubtedly been made to
                            provoke an imprudent reaction. But we expect to continue to make
                            progress. This is a historic moment for both countries. We are proud of
                            our actions and intend to fulfill our commitments.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said it would be
                            helpful if the Vice President made this point in his speech. The Vice
                            President said he would do so.<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">For the text

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said the Vice
                            President would see tomorrow (October 1) how strong the friendship
                            between our countries is. The people were happy and everything concerned
                            with the event was going well.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President remarked that the Panamanian Government had taken
                            abuse because of its attitudes. So had our Government. But we know we
                            have done the right thing. We are here in that spirit.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that
                            Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>, whose absence he regretted,
                            had repeatedly warned the Panamanian Treaty negotiators that various
                            points would give them “a hard time on the Hill.” At times his
                            colleagues had thought these references to Congress were a negotiating
                            trick; but it turned out that the Ambassadors were only telling the
                            truth. President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> hoped the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> people would understand the
                            significance of what had been done. Everything would depend on how we
                            managed the new relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President noted that it was a human relationship. It would be
                            grounded in mutual respect.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> praised Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDP_1">McAuliffe</persName> for their contribution to
                            the successful initiation of the Treaty. They were wise men of good
                            will.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Brademas stated that he and Congressman Hanley were with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Delegation because what the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had done was the honorable thing
                            to do. We wanted good relations with Panama and with all of Latin
                            America. He regretted that Father Hesburgh, who lived in his district
                            (Notre Dame), had been prevented by bad weather from joining the
                            Delegation in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President recalled that Archbishop McGrath had brought Father
                            Hesburgh to Panama, and the latter had helped persuade President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to make the Panama
                            Treaty the first great foreign policy objective of this
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> praised the
                            President and noted that he had made his feelings very clear in his

                        <p>The Vice President said that on Monday night October 1 the President
                            would be speaking on the problem of Soviet activities in Cuba. Soviet
                            military actions there had serious potentialities not only for the fate
                            of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty but for future
                                Soviet/<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations generally. In
                            past years we had extracted commitments from the Soviets to limit their
                            offensive potential in Cuba, and not to establish a naval base at
                                Cienfuegos.<note n="8" xml:id="d247fn8">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>Now we see a Soviet combat unit in Cuba, acting not to train Cubans but
                            in its own independent maneuvers. We are not certain how far back its
                            origins go, but we know now that it consists of 2,500 to 3,000 men, and
                            that there are 1,000 to 1,500 other Soviet military <pb n="592"
                                facs="0627" xml:id="pg_592"/>personnel in Cuba. Cienfuegos is being
                            modernized. The Soviets are furnishing Cuba modern military equipment in
                            large quantities. President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName>
                            knew how active Cuban forces were as Soviet surrogates in Africa. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> subsidized Cuba at a cost of
                            millions of dollars a day. All this was taken very seriously in our
                            country. Without giving any details, the Vice President could say that
                            in President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s speech the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> would respond in an appropriate
                            way. He hoped Panama would consider carefully what President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said, and let us know if it
                            seemed to make good sense. We are rejecting radical schemes, but we
                            would take specific steps designed to restrain the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> asked if we thought
                            that if the Russians wanted <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                            they would remove their troops.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said, confidentially, that we had no evidence they
                            were prepared to remove the combat troops. The Russians would say they
                            were there only for training purposes. They say the brigade is not a
                            combat unit, but we have too much direct evidence to the contrary to
                            believe that. This development has put a substantial strain on our
                            relationships with the Russians. We do not want to link it with <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, but we must act.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said all the Latin
                            American armies would be happy if we acted, including the small
                            Panamanian Army. There was a general concern, not about the Russians in
                            Cuba but about the continued strengthening of the Cuban Army. It was not
                            “correct” to have such a strong military force in this area.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he would report <persName corresp="#p_RA_1"
                                >Royo</persName>’s views to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>. The Soviets were steadily building up Cuban
                            strength. He recalled last year’s episode over the stationing in Cuba of
                            nuclear-capable MIGs. Reverting to the brigade, he said we did not know
                            how long they had been there, but we did know they maneuvered on their
                            own as a combat unit. The Soviet naval presence had also been increased.
                            If we did nothing to discourage it, this strength would continue to
                            increase, and we could not say where this would lead. The President
                            would, therefore, speak quite directly on Monday night.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that in Havana
                            he had found <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Fidel Castro</persName> quite
                            worried about the situation. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Fidel</persName> had wondered why the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> had raised the subject at just the moment of the
                            Non-Aligned Conference. He had pointed out that the Russians had been in
                            Cuba for many years, working as friends. He was concerned at the
                            possibility of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> blockade. But,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> concluded, the Latin
                            American armies believe the Cuban Army is more aggressive than defensive
                            in its design. He then asked if the situation resembled that in
                            1962.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President pointed out that this was a different matter. No
                            nuclear forces were involved in today’s problem. The combat troops in
                            themselves constituted no threat. But they enabled Cuba to project <pb
                                n="593" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_593"/>its military power in Africa on
                            Russia’s behalf. We had to stand up against all this.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> then said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> must be more active in Nicaragua
                            or we would lose the country. The Cubans were there as experts, etc.
                            They were influential. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> must step
                            up its assistance, not only with food and equipment but with technical
                            assistance for Nicaragua’s armed forces and non-lethal military
                            supplies. We must get involved with the Nicaraguan military; this was
                            very important.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that when the Nicaraguan Junta members and the
                            Foreign Minister were in Washington, we told them we wanted to
                                cooperate.<note n="9" xml:id="d247fn9">Message is scheduled for

                            think the moderates were gaining strength?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said he could not
                            tell. Some of the Sandinistas are close friends of Cuba. Any kind of
                            assistance will help stop radicalism. At the moment, the moderates are
                            ahead. While far from conservative in doctrine, they do not want to
                            socialize the Nicaraguan economy.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said we understood the situation. We did not mind
                            taking criticism for our ideas. We will show restraint in Nicaragua, but
                            want to work in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and with other
                            countries to help it. We want to take actions which will strengthen our

                            action.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> remarked that
                            sometimes Latin America leaders must speak as Leftists and then act as
                            Rightists. The Vice President said this was not unknown in the <gloss

                        <p>(C) A Commerce-State Investment Mission visited Panama August 13–17 to
                            examine the investment climate and evaluate prospects for a full-scale
                            business mission at a later date. Although there is substantial
                            investment potential in Panama, the government is currently faced with a
                            number of important obstacles to increased investment. First, there is
                            uncertainty whether the implementation of the new Canal Zone treaties
                            will be efficient and peaceful. Second, the Panamanian Government is
                            poorly organized to promote foreign investment and there is no strong
                            central authority responsible for the facilitation of such investment.
                            These steps are essential to convince investors that Panama is serious
                            about investment. Third, there is a deep sense of disenchantment among
                            the Panamanian business community with government policies and
                            leadership that will seriously undermine the confidence of foreign
                            investors in Panama’s market. As a symptom of the problem, there is
                            little evidence of new investment or reinvestment in Panama by
                            Panamanian Business.</p>
                        <p>(C) For these reasons, the mission members do not believe that this is an
                            opportune time to send a full-scale United States Government-sponsored
                            mission to Panama. The leader of the mission met with the Vice President
                            of Panama at the conclusion of the mission and explained the views of
                            the mission to him in detail. As stated in the report, the Vice
                            President appeared to accept the Mission’s findings and recommendations.
                            In the event that there is definite improvement in the business climate
                            and treaty implementation is proceeding smoothly, <pb n="595"
                                facs="0630" xml:id="pg_595"/>the Mission recommends an investment

                        <p>The Panama Canal Treaty provides for a Supervisory Board of Directors for
                            the Panama Canal Commission consisting of five <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> members and four Panamanians. The Treaty implementing
                            legislation provides that you will appoint the Board members; the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> members will require Senate
                            confirmation. Three of them must be drawn from private life, and a
                            fourth, the Chairman, must represent the Secretary of Defense. In a

                        <p>I believe that the fifth <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> Director
                            should be a representative of the Department of State, for the following
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>—The original Administration bill envisaged State participation on an
                            inter-agency Board pursuant to your decision in 1978.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d249fn3">See <ref target="#d188">Document 188</ref>.</note>
                            Nothing in the implementing legislation as enacted precludes State
                            participation; the legislative history indicates that it was
                            contemplated. It is not in any way inconsistent with the lead role we
                            have envisaged for <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> in Canal
                            management, or affected by bloc <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            voting at the direction of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <pb n="596" facs="0631" xml:id="pg_596"/>
                        <p>—State representation will ensure effective coordination of the most
                            sensitive policy problems arising under the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>—The new Board will be a bi-national agency, and the policy issues it
                            will handle will importantly and perhaps critically affect our relations
                            with Panama and our varied interests in the Canal.</p>
                        <p>—Since 1961, State personnel were consistently included in the Board of
                            the old Panama Canal Company, even though we then exercised exclusive
                            control of the Canal and exclusive jurisdiction in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>I do not agree with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s suggestion
                            that the designation of an Embassy observer to the Board will adequately
                            enable the Department of State to carry out its responsibilities. The
                            Department needs a representative who can participate actively in
                            meetings of the Board and its committees, and in preparation and
                            follow-up activities. This is a separate matter from the agreed
                            requirement that the Panama Canal Commission should keep the Ambassador
                            fully informed regarding its work. Provision for an observer is not a
                            satisfactory alternative to the full membership status enjoyed by
                            Department Board members in the past.</p>

                        <p>Your decision to invite the Shah to Panama is a demonstration of the
                            graciousness and the magnanimity of the people of Panama.<note n="2"

                        <p>The invitation to the Shah also demonstrates to the world that the
                            relationship which our two countries developed during the negotiations
                            for the Panama Canal Treaties is deep, genuine and mutually respectful.
                            As Negotiator for Panama, you played a major role in forging our new
                            relationship. As President of Panama, you have enriched that
                            relationship greatly; it has become a model for industrialized and
                            developing countries.</p>
                        <p>The United States has endured a terrible trauma during the last month
                            while friends and colleagues have been held hostage in the United States
                            Embassy in Iran. We hope that the Shah’s stay in Panama will facilitate
                            a solution to the crisis.</p>
                        <p>I have been pleased to note the forthright position on the issue of the
                            hostages taken by your government at the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"

                            the hostages are freed, as its publication could interfere in the

                            the message he was trying to convey to the Iranians was that Iran could
                            not expect normal treatment under international law (i.e., consideration
                            of an extradition request while he was flouting international law).<note

                            Iranian delegation had brought the request (as a <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> realized that the press

                            said that by “consider” he only meant Panama would receive the request
                            and study it, in the same manner as a complaint is filed in court. He
                            said he would clarify this to the press, as he did not mean to imply
                            that he would consider returning the Shah if the hostages were

                        </opener>
                        <p>The Panama Canal Treaties have now been in force for three months, since
                            October 1, 1979. As I wrote you a few days before that historic date, my
                            country is as committed to making those Treaties work as it was to
                            building the Canal.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">See <ref target="#d245"

                        </p>
                        <p>I have been well pleased these past three months by the manner in which
                            our representatives have addressed the various aspects of our new
                            relationship, and I am confident that we will continue to enjoy the
                            mutual benefits of constructive cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Like you, I am distressed that it has not yet been possible for the Board
                            of Directors of the Panama/Canal Commission to take up their
                            responsibilities. As you know, our Congress laid down some very specific
                            requirements that must be met in selecting the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> members of the board. These requirements, as well as
                            the timing of the enactment of the implementing legislation for the
                            Canal Treaties, have resulted in an unfortunate but unavoidable delay in
                            appointing the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> board members. I am
                            happy to inform you, however, that the administrative processes required
                            by our laws are nearing completion and that I am submitting today the
                            names of my nominees for the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            positions to our Senate for its advice and consent.<note n="3"

                                    >1980–1981,</hi> Book I, pp. 32–34.</note> At that moment I will
                            of course publicly announce the names of the Panamanian candidates for
                            the board.</p>
                        <p>You may be certain that the American members of the board will be
                            informed, interested and competent, and that they will serve faithfully
                            in pursuit of efficient Canal operations.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the Senate has acted, I expect that the board will hold its
                            initial meeting and begin the deliberations with which it is entrusted
                            under the Panama Canal Treaty. Meanwhile, I have asked all officials
                            concerned with Canal activities to undertake now whatever preparatory
                            steps may be possible within the limits of the current procedural
                            situation.</p>

                        <p>You and I and our officials have done much to ensure that the new
                            arrangements for the Panama Canal—under the jurisdiction of your
                            Government—have been put into effect in an atmosphere of trust and
                            businesslike cooperation. I am certain that as we put the final elements
                            of the Treaty structure into place, our two countries can build upon
                            this firm foundation.</p>

                                to the document, the Security Council would 1) adopt a resolution
                                recognizing “the legitimate right of the Government of Iran to seek
                                the extradition of the former Shah and the return of any national
                                assets of Iran improperly removed from Iran” and 2) establish a
                                committee to investigate crimes by the previous Iranian regime that
                                would report its findings to the Secretary General. Simultaneously,
                                the Iranian authorities would release the American hostages in

                        <p>3. The first reaction of the Panamanians seemed to be an expression of
                            clear pique over not having been involved in the action. They said
                            essentially that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was asking
                            Panama to let us follow our game plan entirely without taking Panama
                            into consideration, making Panama look like a <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> instrument. My argument that our proposal included
                            their idea was only partially convincing. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> said that we seemed to be saying, in effect:
                            “be good boys, relax and leave things to us.”</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> said that it was
                            important that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> portray
                            our proposal as having been based upon, or at least strongly affected
                            by, the Panamanian initiatives with Iran. Otherwise, he said, Panama’s
                            future bargaining position and credibility would be undermined, making
                            Panama less useful in trying to find a solution.</p>
                        <p>5. Salamin said that <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName>
                            had made it clear during their meetings that he wanted the hostages out
                            of the country prior to the Presidential elections. He also said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> did not really
                            want the return of the Shah to Iran but just to use the issue of the
                            Shah.</p>
                        <p>6. Salamin also described a rather ingenious conspiracy theory advanced
                            by <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName>: that the Shah,
                            Nixon, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, and David
                            Rockefeller had engineered the takeover of the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Embassy by fanatical students to destabilize Iran
                            under Khomeini. The students, said <persName corresp="#p_GS_1"
                                >Ghotbzadeh</persName>, are right-wing fanatics whose actions were
                            designed to embarrass Khomeini and force him to take an even more
                            radical posture than they. Nevertheless, Khomeini has infiltrated his
                            own students into the leadership and can now control events.</p>
                        <p>7. After a lengthy discussion on events, <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> dictated what he described as a “note verbale
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>,” which
                            Salamin wrote down. Some of it is couched in Torrijos’s biblical style,
                            for which I include authorized interpretations. The others present
                            agreed with it and made some contributions to its composition. <hi

                            agreeable to the Iranians. The proposal is a good one; if it had been
                            advanced after the proper groundwork it would be optimum. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Comment:</hi> the concessions referred to are the
                            recognition of the right to extradition and the appointment of an
                            international commission of inquiry. The Panamanians obviously feel that
                            they would have been a more acceptable channel to use than <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>B) The situation is very fluid and the ability to react to it is slow.
                                (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is not able to move quickly enough to take advantage of
                            shifting events in Iran.)</p>
                        <p>C) A vote of confidence does not require giving a blank check; the fate
                            of the prisoner is determined by the jailer; it is unpleasant to us that
                            we have to keep swearing the oath every day. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Comment:</hi> These <pb n="607" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_607"/>are
                            three somewhat interconnected thoughts. The first is that the
                            Panamanians want to be given a vote of confidence by us to help out with
                            the situation and that we do not run a great risk in giving it to them.
                            The second one is that the Shah is here and they must have some say in
                            determining what is to be done with him. The third expresses irritation
                            that there should be any doubt of Torrijos’s word that he will not
                            deliver the Shah to Iran; he says that his word, once given, is kept
                            forever and that he has never let us down and will not do so.)</p>
                        <p>D) You have not been able to take advantage of carrying out a plan on two
                            levels. We believe that if you give us certain tools, that in a
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> it
                            is possible that we will be able to program the countdown between now
                            and Jan 25 which will culminate in the freeing of the hostages.</p>
                        <p>E) Our team will lay low until we are sure that we are not going to do
                            something to make us look ridiculous. As a matter of principle, we do
                            not go to parties when we are not invited. We went to the party in
                            Tehran on account of the insistent invitation of the other side.</p>
                        <p>F) If there is no coordination, instead of shooting at the target, we are
                            just firing blanks into the air. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This
                            point was originally formulated in a different way, then changed so as
                            not to frighten us or give offense. It originally stated that if there
                            is no coordination, each party will have to be free to decide what to do
                            in its own best interests. Such a thought, obviously, is somewhat
                            inconsistent with the previous point in para E. Throughout the
                            conversation, there was a certain ambivalence in the Panamanian attitude
                            as they said, on the one hand, that the hostages are <gloss
                                target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> citizens and therefore they have to
                            respect our desires in dealing with the situation, and, on the other
                            hand, the strong feeling that they are partners because of having taken
                            in the Shah, that the Shah’s presence represents a certain danger to
                            Panama, and that they have the right to a piece of the action whether we
                            give it to them or not.)</p>
                        <p>G) Any statements on the part of the Shah against Pres <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> will get him a one-way ticket
                            to Tehran. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> this is not a threat to
                            return the Shah, but it means that the Panamanians might so threaten the
                            Shah if he ever spoke up and made statements damaging to Pres <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>H) You should not impose time limits on little people because they react
                            with a form of dignity which is unpredictable and irrational. Besides,
                            in the case of the Iranians, when they die they go directly to heaven.
                            Don’t corner your adversary without leaving him a way out. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Comment:</hi> this point is simply a further
                            expression of frustration that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>

                        <p>I) Up until now, your attitude has been measured and responsible. You
                            must continue in the same way. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> this
                            point gives recognition to the tremendous pressure which Pres <persName

                        <p>J) In order to save their countries and also because of their own
                            electoral objectives, both leaders need each other. (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>8. I met with Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> at 9:00
                            this morning and reviewed the same ground with him. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that it was important that
                            the United States and Panama coordinate their actions and felt that the
                            same team which went to Florida last weekend (Salamin, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName>, Illueca) should go to
                            Washington to work out details. In particular, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said, Panama was faced with the

                            the arrest of the Shah and the extradition request. He said that he was
                            convinced that <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> needed
                            a “face-saving device” and wanted the hostages to be freed, and that
                            Panama could help in this effort.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Recommendations:</hi> the Panamanians feel that they
                            have a useful and efficient channel with Iran. They have considered all
                            along that the Shah’s presence in their country obliges them, for
                            reasons of self-protection as well as their prestige in the world, to
                            deal with Iran. We were partially successful for a time in getting the
                            Panamanians to stay in the background and let us carry our own
                            initiatives forward. As recent events have shown, however, it is
                            unrealistic to expect the Panamanians to remain inactive. If it is
                            important that Panamanian actions and initiatives be programmed to
                            coordinate with ours, I would recommend inviting <persName

                            action which would give the Panamanians a useful and substantive role.
                            The advantage of such course of action is that it would give us a
                            measure of control over what the Panamanians say and do in response to
                            Iranian demands for the Shah’s arrest and extradition.<note n="5"

                        <p>As my formulation indicates, it seems to me that we have so concentrated
                            over the past years on obtainment of a new relationship with Panama
                            pertaining to the Canal and on implementation of the Panama Canal
                            Treaties that we have lost sight of the fact that our primary interest
                            is in a Panama that is democratic and developing, and a reliable
                            free-world partner. It is, in my view, time for us to start putting the
                            treaties behind us and time to get on to the more fundamental matters in
                            our relationship with Panama.</p>
                        <p>It follows from my reordering of our primary foreign policy objective in
                            Panama that I would have restated the problem to highlight the <pb

                            democratic process and steady economic growth. Moreover, I would have
                            incorporated in the Strategy and Steps sections of the memorandum
                            proposals to encourage direct foreign investment and diversification of
                            the Panamanian economy.</p>
                        <p>We shall be incorporating these thoughts in our telegram policy statement

                            Meeting lasted approximately one half hour, was friendly and
                            business-like.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> began by discussing the
                            claims being brought by Nicaragua against Colombia on certain Caribbean
                            islands. He said that his personal view, reinforced during his trip to
                            Colombia last weekend was that the Cubans were behind Nicaraguan claims
                            and that Cuba’s strategy was eventually to end up in control of these
                            islands. <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> suggested that the
                            United States ratify as quickly as possible the treaty signed several
                            years ago with the United States recognizing Colombian rights to
                            Roncador, Quita Sueno and others.<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">Treaty is

                            He said that such move should be considered a “security measure” and
                            should be pushed by Pres <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            as being beneficial to the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> security

                                >Claytor</persName> and <gloss target="#t_AMB_1">Amb</gloss> said
                            that they would consult with the Dept of State on this matter, and
                            acknowledged that the treaty had been before the Senate for several
                            years without Senate action.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_AMB_1">Amb</gloss> took the occasion to deliver to
                            Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> the message from Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> on the situation in
                            El Salvador per <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">Reftel</gloss>. Sec
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWG_1">Claytor</persName> underscored the
                            importance of supporting the Salvadorean Govt and expressed appreciation
                            for Panamanian cooperation in working toward a resolution of serious
                            situation there. <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> said that
                            it was extremely important to help in every way possible and mentioned
                            that he had telephoned FonMin Chavez, who was presently in Lima, on Feb
                            12 and had stressed Panama’s desire to cooperate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> then advanced the view that it was
                            tactically preferable at this point not to make too much public mention
                            of Cuban interference in the Salvador situation, since at this stage it
                            was important to try to maintain a dialogue between the govt and the
                            Left, and “too much finger-pointing and talk about Cubans,” even if
                            true, might tend to polarize the delicate situation. He said there was
                            no doubt, however, about where Panama stood and offered his country’s
                            cooperation. (Note: Gen <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            has been away from Panama City since last Saturday; consequently, on Feb

                            Torrijos’s close advisor Marcel Salamin, who was travelling to the

                        <p>5. Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> stressed that, since
                            the entry into force of the treaties, there was a new sense of
                            friendship between the two countries. Sec <persName corresp="#p_CWG_1"
                                >Claytor</persName> responded that the Dept of Defense supported
                            this friendship strongly, and that Sec <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Brown</persName> and himself, as well as the members of the <gloss

                            the treaties and had a deep commitment to their success. He told Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> that a close friendship
                            for Panama was even more important than the canal itself.</p>
                        <p>6. Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> made a brief
                            reference to “treaty violations,” mentioning specifically the long delay
                            in the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> board nominations. Sec
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWG_1">Claytor</persName> responded that he
                            hoped that within a short time-frame, possibly two to three weeks, the
                            problem would be completely resolved and that our board members would be
                            confirmed and in place.</p>
                        <p>7. Pres <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> asked Sec <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWG_1">Claytor</persName> to give special attention to
                            the need for a feasibility study for a new sea-level canal. He said that
                            what was required of the United States was only an expression of
                            support, rather than a commitment of funds, so that the Japanese would
                            be encouraged to go forward with a sea-level canal study. He said that
                            the Japanese Govt was waiting for a positive signal from the United
                            States, and that was all that was needed. Sec <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWG_1">Claytor</persName> expressed an interest and said
                            that he would look into the matter on his return to Washington.</p>

                        <p>2. We believe that Torrijos’s suggestion concerning a meeting with
                            Salvador and leftist group leaders is something worth exploring, if what
                            he has in mind does not involve undermining the present junta <pb

                        <p>—We are interested in exploring with him his ideas of what might be
                            accomplished by a meeting with the leaders of the Salvadoran leftist
                            groups.</p>

                            signal.</p>
                        <p>—In order to have a clear understanding of our purpose we believe it
                            would be advisable to work out with him a “master plan” based on both
                            countries’ common objectives with a rather specific outline of tasks
                            each might perform. The mechanics of the meeting with Salvadoran leaders
                            including the groups to be represented, the persons who will attend, the
                            venue, and the ground rules.</p>
                        <p>—We recognize that he is very well informed about the internal situation
                            and has excellent contact with the Left and with the military. We have
                            good contacts with the center groups and with the Right. Both of us
                            could use our influence in bringing about a peaceful climate where
                            Salvadorans could work out meaningful reforms in a democratic
                            framework.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I start with the following assumptions: <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> is interested in playing an important role in
                            the future of Central America, and he is interested in trying to steer
                            El Salvador towards a reformist, socially more responsive regime.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> also has enormous
                            respect for <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>, and
                            would not mind being used as Carter’s chosen instrument in Central
                            America. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is also
                            fascinated by <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName>, although he
                            harbors certain lingering concerns that he was used by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> in Nicaragua. (S)</p>
                        <p>I would suggest we begin the discussion with a nostalgic walk back to
                            Nicaragua and that we try to get him to see that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> used him<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d260fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> underlined “him
                                to see that <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName> used him,”
                                highlighted this sentence, and wrote in the left margin: “But be
                                careful not to put him off.”</note> as the vehicle to legitimize
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Castro</persName>’s involvement with the
                            Sandinistas. It is clear that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> now resents the way he has been squeezed out of
                            Nicaragua by Cuba, and we need to play on that, and hope he will draw
                            our lessons from the Nicaragua experience. (S)</p>
                        <p>Our objectives in the meeting should be the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">To get <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                    >Torrijos</persName> to identify the leftist groups and help us
                                to sort through the leftist leaders</hi>, placing leaders in the
                            following categories: (1) hardline intransigents; (2) hardcore
                            Communists (who may be quite pragmatic, like Borge in Nicaragua), (3)
                            pragmatic Marxists (non-Party; more academic), and (4) reasonable
                            moderate-leftists. We are extremely weak in this area, and I’m sure
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> could help. He
                            could also help us to identify the best source of foreign influence over
                            each of the groups. (S)</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">To get <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                    >Torrijos</persName> to help us to divide and neutralize the
                                left.</hi> The first step here is to begin a dialogue with each
                            group, but one at a time or perhaps several if they fall into the same
                            categories. Our task is twofold: (1) to try to pull the pragmatic
                            Marxists and the reasonable, moderate left back into a position where
                            they can support the reform process <pb n="615" facs="0650"
                                xml:id="pg_615"/>undertaken by the junta, and (2) to try to get the
                            hardliners to suspend their fighting for the moment. (S)</p>

                            Nicaraguans that he will tell the Americans if he finds out they are
                            helping the Salvadorean guerrillas, and frankly, the Nicaraguans don’t
                            want to lose <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> aid.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">To mobilize Torrijos</hi> to do three tasks: (1)
                            try to restrain the extreme left; (2) try to persuade the moderate left
                            to support the junta; and (3) to use whatever influence he has in the

                                effective instrument, seizing embassies and buildings.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> is quite proud of his
                            success in dislodging the leftists from the Panamanian Embassy in
                            Salvador by seizing leftists in Panama. We should encourage him to
                            repeat this or seek other ways to get the extremists to stop
                            blackmailing the Junta. (S)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> probably shares the
                            objectives of the Archbishop and the moderate left: to try to split the
                            moderate military off to support the “popular forces.” He may see his
                            first step as trying to shift <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss>
                            support from the Junta to the “popular forces.” He probably thinks such
                            an action would encourage the moderate military to shift their
                            allegiances and for the oligarchy to cut and run for Miami. (S)</p>
                        <p>We will need to persuade <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>

                            have decided the Shah has to leave Panama immediately and what would we

                            Switzerland, both of which replied not now, and South Africa which said
                            no. <persName corresp="#p_ARF_1">Armao</persName> asked what would
                            happen if, hypothetically, some country offered the Shah asylum and he
                            left Panama on his own before the hostages were released. We noted that
                            the decision would obviously be his, but that any travel by the Shah
                            before the hostages are released could considerably complicate our
                            attempts to achieve their freedom.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, it was agreed that we faced two immediate

                            concerns about extradition. On extradition, we noted that we fully
                            believed the Panamanian statements that he would not be extradited and
                            we had no reason to think otherwise. On Panamanian actions inimical to
                            the Shah’s party, we offered to raise this issue in an appropriate way
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>, if the Shah so

                            Panama and Torrijos. By the conclusion of the meeting, he had backed off
                            and seemed willing to let the hostage scenario play itself out for
                            several more weeks before saying anything publicly. <persName

                        <p>3. You could begin by reviewing our conversations with Salamin, Blandon
                            and Delgado on Saturday and Sunday<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">February
                                23 and February 24</note> evening. You should specifically mention
                            that Salamin had said on Sunday that General <persName

                            and <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> immediately through
                            you of our decision your reviewing in some detail our discussions with
                            his “Central American team” should make it easier for you to communicate
                            to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> the extent which we
                            felt betrayed by him. In presenting the foregoing you should stress in
                            particular our role in blocking the rightist coup last weekend—a fact
                            which is well known and publicly commented.</p>
                        <p>4. You could go on to point out that his suggestion that Panamanian
                            officials only accepted the American team because <persName
                                corresp="#p_JH_1">Hamilton Jordan</persName> had asked that they do
                            that is also inaccurate, and <persName corresp="#p_JH_1"
                                >Jordan</persName> is disturbed that the Panamanian official source
                            has said that. You should not hesitate to run down the specific details
                            in that article and seek his explanation for them.</p>
                        <p>5. In conclusion you can make clear to <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> that unless the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"

                                target="#t_ACANEFE_1">ACAN–EFE</gloss> story, it is difficult to see
                            how we can collaborate with him on Central American issues as we would
                            like.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGG_1">Lewis</persName> that he intended to keep Cuba
                            out of the picture. You will recall that Salamin informed us on Sunday
                            he was going on a special mission on Tuesday<note n="6" xml:id="d262fn6"
                                >March 4.</note> and would not be available to go to El Salvador on
                            that day. We have subsequently learned that Salamin travelled to Cuba on
                            Tuesday. We leave it to you whether to raise this apparent contradiction
                            with Torrijos. We would like <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> to know that we are aware of Panamanian
                            contacts with the Cubans following our talks and hope that the purpose
                            was not to concert strategy on support of elements which oppose the
                                <gloss target="#t_JRG_1">JRG</gloss>. Were this the purpose we would

                        <p>I share your views on the importance of monitoring the initial stages of
                            treaty implementation. As you know, the Panama Canal Act of 1979
                            requires me to make recommendations to the Congress by October 1, 1981,
                            regarding necessary or desirable modifications in the implementing
                            legislation. In preparation for this task, it is important that we
                            identify any specific problems that can be attributed to the legislation
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Many of the problems that have arisen so far, however, do not appear to
                            be the result of legislative requirements. And so we need not wait for
                            legislative action to address them. In such cases, I believe problems
                            might usefully be referred for study and recommendation to one or more
                            of the committees established by the Treaties. The Consultative
                            Committee, with its collaborative and independent views, could be
                            especially helpful.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased, as I am sure you are, that the spirit of cooperation built
                            up during the negotiation of our new Treaty relationship has carried
                            over into the initial period of implementation. Because of the intrinsic
                            technical and political problems, differences of opinion will
                            undoubtedly arise from time to time. But I am confident that we will be
                            able to resolve such differences satisfactorily by building on the firm
                            and successful foundation we have already put in place.</p>
                        <p>In closing, I want to assure you once again that the United States is as
                            deeply committed to making these Treaties work as it was to building the
                            Canal. I look forward to continued cooperation and correspondence on
                            whatever difficulties may arise.</p>

                        <p>I share your appreciation of the splendid way in which the citizens of
                            our two countries have adjusted to new conditions created by the Panama
                            Canal Treaties of 1977. The implementation of the treaties has not been
                            without its problems, but I am pleased to see that we are addressing our
                            difficulties in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. One of the
                            most encouraging aspects of our new treaty relationship is the
                            promptness and cordiality of the manner in which the bilateral bodies
                            established by the treaty have been functioning.</p>
                        <p>Your assurance of Panama’s commitment to meet fully its responsibilities
                            under the treaties is most welcome. The United States, you may be sure,
                            will do the same. The spirit of these agreements will provide a lasting
                            foundation for cooperation between our countries in the years to
                            come.</p>

                            they met with Hwang Hwa, Foreign Minister of the Peoples Republic of

                            </hi> said that he wanted to thank the President for giving time to meet
                            with them, and to express General Torrijos’ own pleasure with the
                            results of the Canal Treaties. The Treaties have succeeded in releasing
                            tensions, which could have been destructive, within Panama. General
                            Torrijos’ strategy has always been to try to provide something for both
                            the left and the right. The right is pleased because business has
                            improved since the Canal Treaties. Now the General was thinking of
                            establishing relations with the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of
                            China. The principal reason is to improve capabilities to resist
                            terrorism in Central America and in order to try to quiet leftist groups
                            in Panama. The General thinks that a step like this will show greater
                            independence of Panama in the international sphere without making any
                            basic changes in the structure in Panama. In short, such an act will
                            both reflect and increase the tranquility and peace in the country. They
                            have had a similar experience in establishing relations with Cuba;
                            something that other countries in the area did not do. Panama has found
                            that the establishment of relations with Cuba has helped them to stop
                            internal disorder, and it allows them to handle revolutionary groups in
                            their country much easier. (S)</p>

                            opinion on whether Panama should take this step at this time since the

                            know that he supports the President in his re-election. The

                                >Torrijos</persName> is worried because of the close association

                            Panama, and especially between <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"

                                >Carter</persName>, that such a step could possibly be used against

                                >Escobar</persName> repeated that they wanted the President’s

                            could be used against him in the electoral campaign, General <persName

                            Washington was to talk about El Salvador. Since the coup in El Salvador,
                            the Panamanians have had much contact both with the Junta and the
                            revolutionary groups. Perhaps Panama is the only country that has met
                            with the leaders of both the Junta and the revolutionary groups. At the
                            beginning, it was thought that the Junta would take some action which
                            would bring real reforms to El Salvador. But the Junta did not take
                            advantage of the initial truce after the coup on October 15, 1979, so
                            the violence started again. (S)</p>
                        <p>Panama’s position has been to support the consolidation of a moderate
                            government in El Salvador. We told the Junta they had to rapidly
                            dissolve groups like the Treasury Police, the National Guard, and Orden,
                            which have committed terrible repression. These groups worked with the
                            approval of the government and some sectors of the military, but neither
                            the Army nor the Junta dissolved these groups. What they did do was
                            increase the killing. Panama next tried to consolidate the position of
                            Colonel Majano, and tried to put him into contact with the revolutionary
                            groups, who often met in Panama. First, we tried to help Majano take
                            control of the Junta because we knew that the revolutionary groups would
                            be able to play ball if Majano could take control of the Junta. On this
                            point, the groups are divided. One of the revolutionary groups would
                            like to have the Junta consolidated under Gutierrez, as this would
                            signify a sharp shift to the right, and give the left an excuse to
                            continue the war. Another group would like to see Majano’s influence
                            strengthened so that they could begin communicating with him. (S)</p>

                            revolutionary groups and the Junta, and their conclusion is that El
                            Salvador is living in complete anarchy today. The leaders of the
                            revolutionary groups said they could not stop the war against the Junta.
                            Colonel Majano has weakened himself, and <gloss target="#t_COL_1"
                                >Col</gloss> Gutierrez has become much stronger with the help of the

                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> said that the
                            Panamanians have tried to keep the Sandinistas out of El Salvador as
                            much as possible, and they have definitely pulled out somewhat from
                            Salvador. But the Sandinistas are afraid that El Salvador is moving
                            toward fascism, and the Sandinistas are nervous because Guatemala is so
                            close to the war there. Panama has tried to encourage the Sandinistas to
                            understand that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> strategy is not
                            necessarily to surround their revolution. But the Panamanians feel that
                            the reports that reach Washington are not accurate because the United
                            States does not have access to the revolutionary groups, and therefore
                            the United States is not in a position to analyze what they are
                            thinking. One thing that <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>
                            is certain of is that the right feels that they have the support of the
                            United States again, and if they intensify the repression, they believe
                            they can destroy the revolutionary groups. And the revolutionary groups
                            are happy that the right takes this attitude, because the ultra-leftists
                            feel that in the end, they will destroy the right. At this time,
                            however, both sides cannot destroy the other, but they are destroying
                            Salvador. (S)</p>

                        <p>Place: United Nations, Date: September 22, 1980.</p>
                        <p>Time: 4:00–4:30 p.m.; Participants: Secretary of State, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MED_1">Edmund Muskie</persName>; Foreign Minister of
                            Panama, Carlos Ozores; Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
                            Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">William G. Bowdler</persName>;
                            Panamanian Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, Jorge
                            Illueca; Acting Director for Panama Affairs, <persName
                                corresp="#p_WRR_1">Richard R. Wyrough</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. After amenities, the Secretary inquired whether there were any
                            difficulties attendant to implementation of the Panama treaties and
                            asked whether all was working to the satisfaction of the Foreign
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>4. Ozores responded that the situation to date has been favorable. He
                            commented particularly on the good working relationship and high
                            personal esteem between Administrator <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1"
                                >McAuliffe</persName> and Deputy Administrator <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Manfredo</persName>. He said that a visible amount
                            of good will is being displayed by most parties although there continues
                            to be a lack of acceptance by some individuals that the Canal Zone no
                            longer exists. He commented that this mentality is understandable, but
                            expressed the hope that it will change over time. Ozores also noted the
                            important role which has been played in the past year by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName> and his Embassy team.
                            Ozores said that <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Moss</persName> was
                            effective not only in working on treaty problems and other domestic
                            matters of <pb n="636" facs="0671" xml:id="pg_636"/>concern to Panama
                            but also in dealing with shared concerns regarding Central America.</p>
                        <p>5. The Foreign Minister commented favorably on the Secretary’s morning
                                speech<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">For the text of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MED_1">Muskie</persName>’s address before the 35th
                                session of the U.N. General Assembly on September 22, see the
                                Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 1980,
                                pp. 57–60.</note> and inquired whether he omitted references to
                            Latin America for a specific purpose.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary stressed that the level of <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interest and purpose was very high toward Latin
                            America. He observed that the Caribbean and Central America qualified
                            for coverage as areas in crisis, but he choose instead to concentrate on
                            those areas which are of greater domestic concern. He remarked that he
                            adopted this approach because he wanted to avoid what might appear
                            simply as a catalogue of problems. He asked that the Foreign Minister
                            note seriously that two of the three bilaterals that had been scheduled
                            during his first day at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>
                            session were with countries of Latin America. He observed that besides
                            his meeting with Ozores he was also scheduled to meet with the Foreign
                            Minister of Mexico. He observed that this schedule is evidence of the
                            concern with which the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> views events
                            in the Caribbean area.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary commented that he had been an early supporter of the
                            Panama treaties because of the equities involved in the issue and
                            because the treaties represented an opportunity to convey to the peoples
                            of Latin America the concerns of the <gloss target="#t_US_2"
                                >U.S.</gloss> that we approach other nations with an attitude of
                            mutual equality and respect. With every day, the Secretary observed, he
                            is convinced that this was the correct course of action.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary said that he also wished to meet with the Foreign
                            Minister so that he might inquire how we can work together to improve
                            the situation in the Caribbean region. He referred again to his planned
                            meeting with the Mexican Foreign Minister by noting his intention to
                            address the energy concerns of the region. He observed in this regard
                            that Mexico is an emerging force whose views must be taken into account.
                            He remarked again that although his speech did not mention Latin America
                            his first day’s schedule is heavily concerned with Latin American
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>9. The Foreign Minister asked that the discussion turn to a consideration
                            of the human rights policy pursued by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. Ozores praised the policy and
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> motives in pursuing it. He
                            noted that Panama is especially concerned about the human rights
                            situation in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. He expressed
                            understanding of <pb n="637" facs="0672" xml:id="pg_637"/>the
                            difficulties that we have experienced in pursuing the policy and, in
                            this regard, referred to a statement issued earlier this year during a
                            meeting in Ecuador by the Presidents of Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama and
                            Venezuela and the Vice President of Peru to the effect that criticism of
                            human rights conditions in a country should not be considered as
                            intervention in another’s affairs.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">In
                                telegram 1538 from Quito, March 5, the Embassy reported that
                                President Roldos’s foreign policy advisor had announced on March 4
                                that the “Roldos Doctrine” proposed by Ecuador at the Santa Cruz
                                meeting of the Andean foreign ministers had been ratified at a human
                                rights meeting in Panama. The doctrine held that the “defense of
                                human rights is an international obligation and that, therefore, any
                                individual or collective action taken by the international community
                                in defense of human rights does not contradict the principles of
                                non-intervention.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"
                                    >RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800114–0930)</note> Ozores said that his government shares the
                            human rights policy of the <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> and that
                            this support which is deep-seated in Panama derives from the days of
                            Panama’s founding fathers. In this regard, Ozores recalled a remark by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RA_1">Royo</persName> to the National
                            Security Adviser for Latin America to the effect that Panama understands
                            the human rights policy of the United States because Panama has espoused
                            similar ideals since the days of its founding fathers. He observed that
                            Panama holds in particularly high regard the decisive manner in which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has pursued
                            this policy.</p>
                        <p>10. Ozores referred to the high degree of cooperation between the
                            Panamanian National Guard and the United States military forces in
                            Panama that has developed since treaty entered into force. He stated
                            that the recent training at Fort Bragg involving Panamanian and United
                            States military forces should be viewed in this light and understood by
                            everyone as being pursued within the spirit of the treaty, and in
                            recognition of the fact that both countries are responsible jointly for
                            the defense and protection of the Canal. He observed that some nations
                            do not fully understand this shared purpose and indicated that it is
                            important for Panama to explain its purpose. He said that it was
                            necessary, for example, to refute the suggestion that these exercises
                            are being held as part of an American effort to train Panamanian
                            military forces for intervention in El Salvador or somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>11. Ozores likened the problem of explaining the purposes of military
                            training with those related to our human rights policy. He said that
                            they are problems simply because some people choose to associate or
                            attach the wrong motive for a particular action of policy.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary noted that he had learned much about the countries of
                            the Caribbean basin in recent months. He pointed out that a consistent
                            theme of United States policy in the area has been support for centrist,
                            moderate forces. These forces offer the best hope for improvement in the
                            political and economic status of the citizens of these <pb n="638"
                                facs="0673" xml:id="pg_638"/>countries. The Secretary observed that
                            our providing such support is often misinterpreted as intervention, and
                            stressed that the United States has no wish to impose its will on any
                            nation or people. Rather, <gloss target="#t_US_2">U.S.</gloss> policy is
                            directed toward the elimination of political violence, restoring
                            economic productivity and rekindling hope where none existed before. The
                            Secretary conceded that the United States will sometimes make mistakes
                            in pursuit of this policy, but he hoped that our central purpose would,
                            with the help of our friends in the region such as Panama, be better
                            understood.</p>
                        <p>13. Ozores responded by noting that if one makes no mistakes it is only
                            because nothing has been tried. He assured the Secretary that the United
                            States can be confident of Panama’s cooperation in this area since
                            Panama and the United States share the same concerns.</p>

                                >Escobar</persName> had misrepresented it in his conversation with
                            you. Although our analyses of the situation differ slightly, Bob was
                            able to gain agreement with <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName> on objectives and a program of action, which
                            include the following:</p>
                        <p>1. We will use our influence on the Salvadoran Junta to encourage them to
                            reduce human rights violations by offering certain incentives. (In
                            essence, this is our strategy on helicopters although he did not
                            describe it as such.) (S)</p>
                        <pb n="639" facs="0674" xml:id="pg_639"/>
                        <p>2. Panama will use its influence with the revolutionary groups to get
                            them to reduce the terrorism, and to try to identify those groups who
                            will be more willing to dialogue with the Junta. (S)</p>
                        <p>3. We will both try to strengthen the Junta, encouraging Majano to
                            remain, and we will especially try to maintain a dialogue with Majano’s
                            supporters in the military. (S)</p>
                        <p>4. We urge the Panamanians to open up a dialogue with the Christian
                            Democratic Party, and although <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                                >Escobar</persName> was not enthusiastic about this idea, he said he
                            would convey it to Torrijos. (S)</p>
                        <p>5. We will both try to seek a moratorium on violence, perhaps by trying
                            to obtain an agreement on a stand down in certain regions in El
                            Salvador. (S)</p>
                        <p>6. We will support the electoral process, particularly if the Junta
                            announces such an program, as we expect they will do on October 15.
                            (However, <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> does not think
                            that an electoral program is practical or meaningful in such a violent
                            revolutionary situation.) (S)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> also said that he is
                            confident that <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> will
                            suspend indefinitely any consideration of establishing diplomatic
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> or the Soviet
                            Union. He expressed great appreciation for the opportunity to dialogue,
                            and said that General <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            may very well take up your offer to meet with Bob or another <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> official to discuss the Salvadoran
                            issue in greater detail. (S)</p>

                        <p>While the implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty has generally
                            proceeded well during the first year of the Treaty’s operation,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">An assessment of the first year of treaty
                                implementation by the Embassy in Panama is in telegram 9188 from

                            I am concerned that the mechanisms for ensuring coordination among <pb
                                n="640" facs="0675" xml:id="pg_640"/>our three agencies in Panama
                            are not adequate. My concern derives both from reports from various
                            sources (including the General Accounting Office) and from a number of
                            incidents of poor coordination during the past year. I have attached for
                            your consideration a sampling of such incidents, which illustrates the
                            serious dimensions of the problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Attached
                                but not printed. The incidents included radio frequencies, Embassy
                                representation on the Joint Committee, the Joint Committee Charter,
                                contractor withholding of income tax from Panamanian employees,
                                convoy movement, telephone service, and building use among
                                others.</note> Because our total presence in and relationship with
                            Panama are affected, I believe that we should act to remedy this
                            situation as promptly as possible.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Charles Duncan</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACL_1">Clifford Alexander</persName> and I
                            issued guidance to govern the relationship between the Administrator and
                            the Ambassador.<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">See <ref target="#d201"
                                    >Document 201</ref>.</note> At about the same time, guidance was
                            worked out between our Departments concerning agency coordination for
                            the activities of the two military committees established by the
                                Treaty.<note n="5" xml:id="d273fn5">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The guidance, which establishes the concept that effective implementation
                            of the Treaty requires the coordination of the policies and activities
                            of the three agencies, remains sound. But I am concerned that officials
                            of our Departments are apparently at odds over the spirit and
                            application of this guidance. While I had hoped that the means for
                            applying the guidance could be worked out among our representatives in
                            Panama, I now believe it would be useful to provide our representatives
                            with a clear indication that we mean what we say in instructing our
                            agencies to coordinate. What is essential is a clear-cut process whereby
                            United States’ positions falling within the purview of the Joint and
                            Coordinating committees are fully cleared within the United States
                            Government at all stages of their development, negotiation, and
                            conclusion, and at all levels of agency consideration, prior to any
                            discussions with Panama. The best means for achieving the needed
                            coordination, in my judgment, would be to provide full Embassy
                            membership on the Coordinating and Joint Committees and to reestablish a
                            committee functioning under the auspices of the Panama Review Committee
                            which would be responsible for establishing and implementing clearance
                            procedures. I would welcome your thoughts.<note n="6" xml:id="d273fn6"

                        <p>Dear General Torrijos</p>
                        <p>The press of events worldwide has kept me out of Washington a good deal
                            of the time during the past weeks and I regret not having been able to
                            correspond personally with you as I intended on the anniversary of the
                            treaties last month. However, I would like at this time to convey to you
                            my recognition of the substantial progress which our respective forces
                            have made in ensuring the successful, initial implementation of the
                            Panama Canal Treaties which entered into effect just over a year ago.
                            The foundation for cooperation which has been laid during this first
                            treaty year should provide us an enduring basis for continuing to build
                            into the future. Your personal assistance, and that of your principal
                            deputies, in resolving problems as they arise will continue to be an
                            essential part of this process. General <persName corresp="#p_NW_1"
                                >Nutting</persName> will be happy to meet with you or your
                            representatives at any time.</p>

                            conclusion of the Panama Canal Treaties and the establishment of a new
                            relationship of friendship and cooperation between our two countries. I
                            know that this new relationship could never have occurred without your
                            personal dedication and untiring efforts to make the Treaties a reality.
                            We can take justifiable pride in having shown how two nations can
                            resolve their differences in a spirit of mutual respect and
                            understanding. We can also be proud of the recent Declaration of Santa
