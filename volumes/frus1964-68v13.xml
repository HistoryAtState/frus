                <p>The Foreign Relations of the United States series presents the official
                    documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant
                    diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the
                    facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes
                    evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the
                    volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
                    generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations
                    codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the
                    series were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March
                    26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government, including
                    facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that provided
                    supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                    Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity
                    and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating
                    in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should
                    omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the Foreign Relations series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>
                <p>The statute also requires that the published record in the Foreign Relations
                    series include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further
                    requires that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S.
                    Government cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full
                    and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions
                    and by providing copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
                    particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
                    summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding issues that cannot be
                    documented in the volume but will be addressed in editorial or bibliographical
                    notes.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume, which was compiled in 1992 and 1993, are convinced
                    that it meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection
                    and editing. Although this volume records policies and events of more than 30
                    years ago, the statute of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to
                    reach the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>
                <p>An explanation of the selection policy for the series and of this particular
                    volume and a detailed description of the sources available to the editors of the
                    series as well as a list of specific files consulted for this volume follow this
                    preface.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the Foreign Relations series
                    that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the 5 years
                    (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName>. In planning and preparing the 1964–1968 subseries, the
                    editors chose to present the official record of U.S. foreign policy with respect
                    to Europe, the Soviet Union, and Canada in six volumes.</p>
                <p>Volume XIII (presented here) documents U.S. policy regarding European economic
                    and political integration and U.S. participation in NATO. Volume XII, Western
                    Europe and Canada, documents U.S. relations with Canada, France, Italy,
                    Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Volume XIV, Soviet Union, includes
                    documentation on U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations. Volume XV, Berlin; German
                    Question, documents U.S. involvement in the continuing Four-Power negotiations
                    over divided Germany and the status of Berlin. Volume XVI, Cyprus; Greece;
                    Turkey, documents U.S. efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem and its response to
                    the constitutional crisis in Greece and subsequent coup d'etat. Volume XVII,
                    Eastern Europe; Czech Crisis, documents the basic <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>record of U.S. relations with Czechoslovakia and the other
                    states of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                    monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and assists
                    with any access and/or clearance problems that arise. Time constraints prevent
                    the Advisory Committee from reviewing all volumes in the series.</p>
                <p>This volume has not been reviewed by the Advisory Committee.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The declassification review of this volume in 1994 resulted in the decision to
                    withhold less than 1 percent of the documents originally selected; 3 documents
                    were not declassified. The remaining documentation provides an accurate account
                    of the main lines of U.S. policy toward Western Europe during the 1964–1968
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the Department of State declassification review
                    of the documents published in this volume. The Declassification Coordination
                    Division of the Historian's Office coordinated the interagency and foreign
                    government declassification review. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
                    particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
                    summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding issues that cannot be
                    documented in the volume but will be addressed in editorial or bibliographical
                    notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in accordance with
                    their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In
                    selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to
                    unpublished classified records, rather than previously published records (which
                    are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other

                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department

                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>13. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major

                <p>14. Documentation that illuminates special decisionmaking processes that
                    accomplished the policies recorded in particular volumes;</p>
                <p>15. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scope and Focus of Documents Researched and Selected for
                    Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XIII</p>
                <p>The documentation printed in this volume highlights U.S. policy toward European
                    economic and political integration, U.S. participation in the North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization (NATO), and the U.S. attitude toward the Multilateral Force
                        (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>) and Atlantic Nuclear Force (<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>). It further discusses the position of the
                    United States with regard to the question of nuclear sharing within the Atlantic
                    community.</p>
                <p>The primary institution responsible for policy formulation on these questions was
                    the Department of State. Documents were included from the files of Under
                    Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>, who
                    drafted many of the papers on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and directed the special working group devoted
                    to these problems. He also participated in the conversations between Secretary
                    of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and his foreign counterparts
                    and President Johnson and European leaders when these topics were discussed.</p>
                <p>Because of the extensive amount of documentation on U.S. participation in NATO,
                    the editors selected summaries of the North Atlantic Council Ministerial
                    meetings and summary records of the visits of the NATO Secretaries General to
                    Washington, during which long series of <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0011"/>conversations were held. The editors also focused on documenting the U.S.
                    response to French withdrawal from the NATO military command structure in March
                    1966. President Johnson set the tone of the response and Francis Bator of the
                    National Security Council Staff coordinated the details of the policy. For the
                    period after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the editors selected
                    documentation that shows that the White House took an active role in the
                    formulation of policy toward NATO. The editors also selected reports from posts
                    in Brussels, London, and Paris to document U.S. policy toward the general
                    question of European economic and political integration and toward the second
                    British application for membership in the Common Market in 1967.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
                    included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained
                    as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0012"/>unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. All
                    brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign
                    Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S.
                    Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and other
                    entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the Department of State Historian
                    by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. The editors
                    believe that in terms of access this volume was prepared in accordance with the
                    standards and mandates of this statute, although access to some records was
                    restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p>The editors have complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts.
                    Intelligence-related files maintained by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have access
                    to these records for future volumes; if any documentation relevant to this
                    volume is found, it may be included in a subsequent volume.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers
                    of President Johnson and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential
                    papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of
                    the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of this
                    documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign Relations series
                    thanks to the consent of these agencies and the cooperation and support of the
                    National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The Department of State has arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
                    Johnson's telephone conversations, which are held at the Johnson Library. The
                    first audiotapes became available to the editors in late 1994, with most to
                    follow during 1995 and 1996. The editors decided not to delay publication of
                    this volume, but if relevant records are found <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>among these telephone conversations, they may be included in a
                    later Foreign Relations volume.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those records
                    still in the custody of that Agency. Department of State historians' access is
                    arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State and CIA historians continue to
                    work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of the access, and the variety of
                    documentation made available and selected for publication in the volumes has
                    grown.</p>
                <p>The following are the particular files and collections consulted and cited in
                    this volume.</p>

                <p>Subject-Numeric Indexed Central Files. In February 1963, the Department changed
                    its decimal central files to a subject-numeric central file system. The new
                    system was divided into broad categories: Administration, Consular, Culture and
                    Information, Economic, Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each
                    of these divisions were subcategories. For example, Political and Defense
                    contained four subtopics: POL (politics), DEF (defense) CSM (Communism), and INT
                    (intelligence). Numerical subdivisions further defined them.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This volume opens in January 1964, 2 months into President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>'s administration, which
                    continued the policies that had been initiated by President John F. Kennedy. The
                    foreign policy team assembled by President Kennedy remained largely intact with
                    Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName>, Under
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George W. Ball</persName>, and the
                    President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> continuing to dominate policy
                    formulation toward Europe. In the aftermath of the Cuban and Berlin crises,
                    relations with the Soviet Union appeared to be entering a new and less directly
                    confrontational phase. At the same time, burgeoning European economic power,
                    revived French nationalism forcefully expressed by President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>, and Germany's evolving role
                    in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization threatened the continued cohesion of
                    the Alliance. As the important challenges were met, U.S. foreign policy toward
                    Europe began to reflect President Johnson's own goals and objectives.</p>
                <p>U.S. policymakers focused on the Multilateral Force (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>) as a means of consolidating the defense of Europe without
                    foregoing control of strategic weapons. It also would give the West Germans a
                    reasonable level of participation in the management of NATO's nuclear weapons.
                    Despite considerable Allied effort to reach a consensus, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> did not enjoy widespread support. Although
                    German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard joined with President Johnson to support the
                        <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, within NATO the French opposed the
                    concept from the beginning. The British had strong reservations about its
                    military aspects, and delayed further consideration of the force until after the
                    1964 fall elections when a new Labour government was elected.</p>
                <p>The new British Government's position on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                    made clear that it preferred not to participate and that it opposed the force
                    unless it was part of a larger integrated command. The U.S. Government agreed to
                    suspend judgment on the British ideas until they could be discussed with the
                    other NATO Allies. During British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName>'s visit to Washington in December 1964, the
                    President pointed out that his overwhelming interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and nuclear forces in NATO was to make sure
                    that Germany participated fully in some form of multilateral force. In the
                    meetings, the two sides exchanged papers attempting to define a British idea for
                    an Atlantic Nuclear Force (<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>), which would
                    include the Germans and any other members of the NATO Alliance who wanted to
                    participate.</p>
                <p>Neither the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> was approved in 1965, despite U.S. and British efforts and
                    German interest. In response to this failure, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName> proposed creation of a
                    Select Committee <pb n="XXVIII" xml:id="pg_XXVIII" facs="0028"/>of Defense
                    Ministers to consider expanded Allied participation in planning for the use of
                    nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s proposal met
                    with membership approval (except for the French) at a meeting of the NATO
                    Permanent Representatives in June. All this transpired against a background of
                    increasingly frequent French statements about reexamining the NATO Alliance with
                    the aim of bringing forces and installations in France under French command and
                    freeing French forces from NATO control. Progress on the nuclear question slowed
                    as France provoked a crisis within the European Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>), which it linked with its demand for
                    reorganization of NATO. Once again the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question was eclipsed. The
                    Select Committee, however, was not affected, and held its first formal meeting
                    on November 27, when working groups devoted to studying the nuclear role of the
                    Alliance were established.</p>
                <p>Chancellor Erhard attempted to resolve the impasse over Alliance nuclear sharing
                    during a visit to Washington in December 1965, presenting President Johnson with
                    a paper that proposed a “hardware” solution to the problem, which could be
                    considered on a tripartite basis. The President concluded that tripartite
                    consideration of the Chancellor's suggestion should begin early in 1966.</p>
                <p>The attention of policymakers was diverted, however, to France's role in the
                    Alliance. On March 7, 1966, President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName> made his long awaited démarche on NATO. He informed
                    President Johnson that France was removing its forces from the NATO integrated
                    command and that all foreign forces and installations in France must be placed
                    under French command. A March 11 aide-memoire filled in the specifics of the
                    French proposal. Despite the elusive character of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s political motivation, it became increasingly clear to
                    U.S. policymakers that he intended a fundamental change in France's relationship
                    with the Western Alliance. In the opinion of many observers, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had concluded that the Soviet threat
                    had diminished to acceptable levels and sought a France with political and
                    military autonomy, free to pursue its own national interests.</p>
                <p>While making clear the seriousness with which he viewed the French decision,
                    President Johnson sought to avoid a direct confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The United States thus began the
                    complex process of reestablishing the Alliance (effectively without France),
                    working within a NATO framework rather than treating the crisis as a bilateral
                    matter. In his March 22 reply to de Gaulle, President Johnson noted that
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s proposals would severely
                    affect the security of the whole Alliance, which was fundamental to Western
                    security. He also questioned the wisdom of French reliance on an independent
                    deterrent. President Johnson believed that since nothing could be gained by
                    debating the French on <pb n="XXIX" xml:id="pg_XXIX" facs="0029"/>their
                    decision, the task of the United States should be to rebuild the Alliance
                    outside of France as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>The discussion among the 14 Alliance members that followed left the French
                    isolated. The organization proceeded to work out arrangements to move NATO
                    headquarters out of France and to reach agreements on the compensation that
                    member states would receive for removing their forces and transferring their
                    installations out of the country. A key ancillary issue centered on the future
                    of French troops stationed in West Germany under NATO auspices. A satisfactory
                    solution to the matter carried particular significance for U.S. policymakers who
                    feared that the Germans might be provoked to seek a unilateral solution to their
                    most pressing problem— reunification. France maintained that its troops, like
                    other French commands, could no longer be integrated into NATO commands, and
                    after extensive conversations, the West German Government eventually accepted
                    the view that French forces would not continue as a component of NATO's
                    integrated command.</p>
                <p>Although Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> warned the
                    President that the French decision might bring the issue of nuclear sharing and
                    consultations on the use of nuclear weapons to the fore, the issue was largely
                    overshadowed by the practical consequences of the French departure from the NATO
                    military command structure, the question of U.S. and British force reductions in
                    Europe, the offset negotiations, and the studies on the future of NATO. At the
                    December 1966 NATO Ministerial meeting, the Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee
                    and the Nuclear Planning Group were established, and became the forum for
                    discussion of nuclear questions in Europe. The Federal Republic of Germany,
                    however, continued to be especially concerned with the question of prior
                    consultation and participation in decisions affecting the use of nuclear
                    weapons, and in March 1968 President Johnson approved nuclear consultation
                    arrangements with Germany that would satisfy German requests for “sovereign
                    rights in the nuclear field.”</p>
                <p>Further concerns regarding Alliance stability had emerged as the United Kingdom,
                    under mounting financial pressure in the summer of 1966, sought to reduce its
                    troop strength in West Germany unless it obtained a German Government commitment
                    to offset the costs. Although less acute, U.S. balance-of-payments problems also
                    forced similar demands on the Germans. The trilateral offset discussions began
                    late in 1966 as the Americans, British, and Germans focused on what
                    reimbursement the Federal Republic would make to the United States and the
                    United Kingdom for the maintenance of their forces in Germany.</p>
                <p>President Johnson appointed former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName> to lead the U.S. delegation for
                    the trilateral talks. In meetings at Bonn and then in Washington, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> encountered heavy German resistance to
                    a full offset reimbursement as well as a <pb n="XXX" xml:id="pg_XXX" facs="0030"/>strong British desire to withdraw some of their forces immediately from the
                    continent. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> eventually succeeded
                    in getting British agreement to a 6-month delay in any withdrawal, but when the
                    talks recessed at the end of 1966, Germany was still unwilling to fund all
                    offset costs. President Johnson instructed <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to resume the trilateral talks in March 1967. Hard
                    bargaining eventually resulted in a new offset agreement in April, which
                    ultimately avoided dramatic reductions in U.S. and British military assets on
                    the continent, although at some expense to American economic interests.</p>
                <p>As the trilateral offset negotiations were proceeding, the British Government
                    sought a more permanent solution to its economic problems by applying for
                    membership in the European Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>). Despite tacit U.S. support and early indications that the
                        <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would welcome the United Kingdom's
                    membership, British hopes were disappointed at the Common Market Council of
                    Ministers meeting in December 1967, when the French effectively vetoed the
                    application by insisting that British economic recovery was a precondition for
                    membership.</p>
                <p>As the United Kingdom sought to define a reduced role in Europe for itself,
                    efforts to stabilize the NATO Alliance without France continued. In November
                    1966, Belgian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Pierre
                        Harmel</persName> proposed a study on the future of the Alliance, in view of
                    the extensive reorganization of NATO that had taken place since March. His
                    proposal was approved at the December North Atlantic Council Ministerial
                    meeting. By the summer of 1967 progress on the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study was underway, again in the face of French
                    opposition. Four subgroups were appointed to consider various aspects of the
                    future of NATO, and the United States voiced strong approval for the process.
                    Despite fears that France would undermine the process, a series of studies
                    setting forth strategies for a renewed Alliance without France received
                    unanimous support from the NATO members. The <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study was approved at the North Atlantic Council
                    Ministerial meeting in December 1967, and became the basis for the future
                    development of the Alliance.</p>
                <p>The calm effected by the approval of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study and the discussions with the Soviet Union in the
                    first 6 months of 1968 on mutual reduction of forces in Europe was shattered by
                    the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August. The attack reminded the United
                    States and its NATO Allies that the Western Alliance had strong reasons to
                    remain vigilant. At the November 1968 North Atlantic Council Ministerial
                    meeting, the NATO members formally recognized that the situation in Central
                    Europe had changed dramatically, and key members pledged to improve their
                    military forces. The Council also approved sending a political signal to the
                    Soviet Union that any further interventions would create an international crisis
                    with grave consequences.</p>

                        toward political institutions. He was struck by the fact that this result is
                        not considered such a good thing here. He said the allegations about an
                        ultimatum were unfounded and that the Six had reached decisions in
                        accordance with their previous agreement to take action on a common
                        agricultural policy by the end of 1963, and to agree about undertaking trade
                        negotiations with outside countries. The consolidation of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will increase demand for US goods, which
                        had increased 60 percent over the past five years, although perhaps not for
                        the same goods. He did not believe this was a sign of protectionism.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we have been cautious in commenting since we were not sure
                        what happened at Brussels. He had indicated in his press conference<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s press conference on January 2, see Department of

                        will discuss them with the Commission and with the Six, but there is to be
                        no special US-German machinery. We are pleased by the absence of catastrophe
                        at Brussels but <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0032"/>we did not wish to go
                        overboard until we had seen the details of the decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that while they may not make the full 50 percent linear
                        reductions they will at least move in the direction of tariff cuts. He
                        realized how complicated were tariff negotiations. He deplored the fantastic
                        article from Luxembourg in today's Wall Street Journal about protectionism
                        under French leadership. This is not at all what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said to the President in November.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that decisions may be taken at Luxembourg this week about
                        steel tariffs and said the question is whether we can get into the trade
                        negotiations in May before restrictive measures are taken in various
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that the French
                        had the idea that Wormser should come here for talks but he would not wish
                        to see charges of any special US-French machinery. Although the visit had
                        been envisaged before Brussels, he wondered if we were still interested.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we would inquire of Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and would be in touch with him.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Walker Givan, <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Neil Seidenman, Interpreter</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0033"/>After a discussion of the Italian
                        political situation, the Secretary asked the Foreign Minister to comment on
                        the situation in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and prospects for
                        European unity in light of the Brussels meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that Brussels marked an important step toward a
                        common agricultural policy, but there should be no illusions that it also
                        marked progress toward political union; much water must flow before
                        political unity is achieved.</p>
                    <p>Noting that both <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> have mentioned the
                        possibility of new initiatives, the Secretary asked what measures to promote
                        European unity the Foreign Minister considered likely or desirable in the
                        near future. The Minister replied that it was good for leaders to talk about
                        unification and that, viewed in the spirit of Atlantic partnership as
                        outlined by President Kennedy, it is obvious that Europe must become united;
                        but it is impossible to conceive of a unified Europe without the UK.
                        Although we cannot stand immobile, we cannot do anything that would hamper
                        Britain from adhering later. If there is to be a political relance, it must
                        be done without polemicizing with the UK and with the British fully
                        understanding every step. If any group of Italian politicians should agree
                        on a European initiative without the UK, their initiative would lead nowhere
                        because a majority of Italians would never approve it. The Italians intend
                        to make this clear to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> next
                        month in Paris. At the same time Italy does not intend to join any crusade
                        against <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>; this is
                        unnecessary since his policy collapses by itself, as illustrated by the fate
                        of the Paris-Bonn axis. But <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        must be convinced that Italy will not accept European integration without
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what the Foreign Minister would advise the United States
                        to do now: Should we stay outside the problem and leave it to the
                        Europeans?</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the United States cannot stay outside
                        because it and Europe are members of the Atlantic community. The only
                        question is where the United States should intervene, and the best place is
                        the UK. The Minister regretted having to criticize friends in the British
                        Labor Party, but when <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> attacked
                        the Brussels decisions he did a disservice to integration. Secondly, when
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Walker</persName> (hopefully a future
                        Foreign Secretary) talks as if it were necessary to have a directorate with
                        Germany and France he is adopting a Gaullist position.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Italians could dismiss the second point from their
                        minds. Any proposals of a directorate would have a high infant-mortality
                        rate. The first point on the Brussels decisions is more complicated and
                        depends mainly on a successful outcome of the Kennedy Round trade
                            negotiations,<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministerial negotiations which would
                            begin on May 4 to discuss tariff reductions.</note> which we consider
                        necessary for Atlantic <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0034"/>cohesion. The
                        Secretary invited the Foreign Minister to comment: Did he anticipate a
                        successful Kennedy Round?</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that Italy's views are receptive, as are those
                        of the Benelux and to some extent Germany since the Kennedy Round more or
                        less suits their economic situation. The French are more reserved, but the
                        atmosphere as a whole is favorable and the French will find this difficult
                        to resist.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> asked whether the
                        Brussels decisions implied that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        agricultural policy is now fixed or whether it is still negotiable; we are
                        concerned since it is our position that industry and agriculture should not
                        be considered separately but as different aspects of the same thing.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that he did not regard himself as expert in
                        agricultural matters and could only reason as a man in the street. He
                        believed, however, that agriculture would present the most difficulties to
                        negotiators, even among the Europeans themselves, in view of the disparities
                        in their agricultural development. A common policy, however, has the merit
                        of inducing all concerned to modernize their agriculture. It has effectively
                        awakened Italian leaders, who are now doing something to renovate Italian
                        agriculture.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he felt the Kennedy Round negotiations deserved to be
                        approached on the broadest political basis in the perspective of the
                        Atlantic partnership. Too technical an approach could have a poor result.
                        For example, in 1960 he would have regarded the Trade Expansion Act of
                            1962<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">The Trade Expansion Act of 1962, approved
                            October 11, 1962; P.L. 87–794.</note> as impossible, but fortunately
                        this legislation was approached with a broad view for the common good of all
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> commented that it
                        would be difficult to divide the problem into agricultural and industrial
                        sectors. Restrictions in agriculture would make it difficult to move in the
                        industrial field—hence his earlier question whether <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural policy is fixed or still negotiable.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        members have reached agreement in three fields—meat, rice and fats—on the
                        basis of compromises considered useful for Europe. It may be possible to
                        change them when they are reviewed in a wider framework. Though no expert,
                        he thought these agreements were not unchangeable. He cited as a parallel
                        the Italian shift recently with regard to steel tariff increases. When the
                        High Authority of the Coal and Steel Community, headed by an Italian
                        citizen, moved against the Italian position, Italy accepted the High
                        Authority's decision.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that for
                        Italy the problem of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was one of
                        timing and principally timing affecting the Italian Socialist Party (PSI).
                        The Foreign Minister had talked to Nenni on several occasions recently and
                        has found Nenni personally favorably disposed to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The problem of time, however, is unavoidable and cannot be
                        telescoped. Nenni told the Foreign Minister he must have time to prepare his
                        party. He does not need a long time—only four or five months, perhaps.
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said it is
                        important to note Nenni has undertaken a commitment to prepare his party for
                        the decision.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that the attitude of the UK is an important one and
                        will have great influence in Italy whatever the results of the UK elections.
                        Anything that the U.S. can do to bring about a more favorable attitude by
                        the UK would be helpful in Italy.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said he has
                        accepted British Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>'s request that he prolong his stay by a few days
                        during his forthcoming visit to the UK. He plans to use this time to talk to
                        Labor <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0036"/>Party leaders. He will ask them
                        not to do anything which would make the Italian problem more difficult. He
                        will also tell them of the Italian position on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> continued that despite the

                        and the favorable disposition of many groups, some obstacles remain and must
                        be removed before final and formal acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> by Italy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thanked the Foreign Minister for his views. He did not see any
                        contradiction between what the Foreign Minister had been saying and the need
                        to move along with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If we have a
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> report by the first of March we can
                        then move on to draft an agreement. Meanwhile the multilaterally manned ship
                        experiment can go forward. The Secretary emphasized that it was important
                        not to lose forward movement.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the UK, the Secretary said the Foreign Minister may find
                        during his visit to the UK that there are differences of opinion there. It
                        should also be noted that there are differences between what the British of
                        both parties say now and what they are likely to say or be able to say after
                        the election. The Foreign Minister will need to feel his way to see what the
                        real UK position is. The Secretary emphasized that in any event he wished to
                        assure the Foreign Minister the US is not pulling away from the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. We feel that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is of great importance.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> reiterated
                        that the Italian decision has been made in principle. The Prime Minister is
                        convinced on the subject of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as is the
                        Vice Prime Minister (Nenni). The only thing that is required is a little
                        more time. Ambassador Reinhardt knows the situation very well and can
                        confirm this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Foreign Minister in a previous conversation in
                        the day had said something important about his visit to London.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">See <ref target="#d2fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            2</ref>.</note> He had said the decision with regard to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be an Italian decision made in
                        Italy's own interest and would not be determined by what was said to him in
                        London.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that the British lack interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> for two reasons: (1) they already have a
                        nuclear force of their own and therefore lack political motivation; and (2)
                        the British Military feel they will not be able to have other things they
                        want if they are obliged to make the financial effort required by
                        participation in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Secretary said
                        that on a personal basis he felt that the UK will not be able to stay out of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the long run if the momentum of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is maintained. He believes the UK
                        will come in if they see the rest of us going ahead.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that the
                        opposition from the right in Italy is attempting to overthrow the coalition
                        government. The U.S. must <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0037"/>be careful
                        not to give them an opportunity by pressing Italy for too early a decision
                        on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Foreign Minister said that
                        when he talked with Nenni regarding the experimental <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> ship, Nenni had seemed very understanding. The problem
                        therefore was not connected with the matter of final acceptance of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> but was instead one of time. Nenni
                        could have created difficulties over the ship experiment but did not do
                        so.</p>

                            their personal consideration of the question. (Both ibid.)</note>
                        Subject: Guidance re UK and European Political Union.</p>
                    <p>1. Despite momentary lull, the Six remain attracted, with varying degrees of
                        interest and for different reasons, to new initiative for political union.
                        Emboldened by their success in overcoming year-end Community crisis, they
                        see a need and perhaps opportunity for further consolidating European
                        Community and quite logically consider that next step should be political
                        one. Some elements within the Five may be ready now or in the near future,
                        in fact, to compromise and accept <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s “confederal” concept with only limited if any
                        “revision” clause looking to eventual “federal” union. During past year,
                        insistence by Five has weakened on British involvement in political union
                        discussions. Further, there appears to be less sensitivity by Six about
                        relationships of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to non-member European
                        states.</p>
                    <p>2. We would be concerned, as we have been in the past, if discussions and
                        negotiations were to lead to inward-oriented “small Europe,” which had
                        characteristics of excluding British for all time, promoting “Europe des
                        patries,” and ignoring collateral policy of Atlantic partnership.</p>
                    <p>3. Odds seem against French view prevailing out of current flurry of
                        activity. As Embassy Bonn points out, history of past several years has
                        demonstrated that self-interest of other Five operates as considerable
                        safeguard to our basic political and security interests in Europe.</p>
                    <p>4. Important to note ambiguity <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s
                        position. He emphasized during discussions in Washington in November<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">For a memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at the time of former President

                        parliamentary control over Common Market Commission. Referred vaguely to
                        need for political authority but at same time turned back suggestions that
                        answer could be found in directly-elected parliament. Nor did <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> accept fact that Council of Ministers
                        is institutional <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>device to meet problem
                        of high-level national political control. Noteworthy that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s thinking on these subjects has not
                        substantially changed over last several years, e.g. he has resented <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> authority over number of economic questions
                        and implication that Community engaged in economic planning. He also
                        dislikes President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>. While
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> seems to have retreated
                        from position favoring early heads of government meeting on political unity
                        outlined in his Bonn press conference, it cannot be discounted that his
                        thoughts as outlined above in certain respects seem closer to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s than to those of European
                        integrationists. Question will be whether in longer run views of <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> prevail.</p>
                    <p>5. Evidence suggests that Belgians, Germans and Italians—and, of course,
                        Dutch—would insist, at least at outset any discussions, on three criteria on
                        which the Fouchet proposal floundered:<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">Reference

                        undercutting of three economic communities, and option that political
                        arrangements could be revised to introduce principle of federalism. In view
                        of the array of nations opposed to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s position, it seems unlikely that an early initiative
                        will be launched.</p>
                    <p>6. British Government has been conducting intensive campaign to insure its
                        participation in any new moves toward political unity and has asked for our
                        support to this end.<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5">The British Ambassador had

                            remained unchanged, but that direct U.S. involvement or representations
                            would not be helpful and might raise charges of Anglo-Saxon interference
                            in European affairs. (Telegram 4404 to London, January 21; ibid.,

                        should we be wrong in our prediction that early initiative is unlikely, we
                        do not see how United States could intervene to profit either the British or
                        ourselves. In fact, expression of American views on a yet unborn proposition
                        would hardly be persuasive with our friends and lend currency once again to
                        epithet “Anglo-Saxons” which would be used against British (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4404 to London).</p>
                    <p>7. In this complex European situation American officials will have to move
                        with care. While we want responsible Europeans to be in no doubt as to our
                        views as to desirability or value of political unity, we do not wish to be
                        charged with interference in matter. Against this background you may use
                        foregoing analysis and following specific points to restate US views on
                        European unity or in response on inquiries about US attitude on UK

                    <p>a. Although we remain vitally concerned with form and direction of European
                        unity, we intend to keep open mind and await clearer indication than we now
                        have of nature and timing of any new move. At this stage, before any
                        European state has put forward a specific proposal we may have best
                        opportunity to reiterate our support of basic criteria outlined in paragraph
                        five above, without opening ourselves to charge of interference in delicate
                        internal community negotiations.</p>
                    <p>b. We feel that UK interests will be kept in mind and defended most capably
                        by combination of Britain's own diplomatic efforts and those of the Benelux
                        countries, Italy and Germany. We would hope that Five will find it possible
                        to defer any new initiative until after British elections as means of
                        keeping European issue out of the British campaign.</p>
                    <p>c. Finally, it is clearly up to British to demonstrate to their Continental
                        friends—and to skeptics as well—that in fact and theory they want to play a
                        constructive role in making of Europe.</p>

                        <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0041"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said that he might say something at the May meeting
                        about the importance of NATO political consultation. However, he was
                        disappointed because while there was general agreement to improve such
                        consultation, <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions tended to be
                        limited to questions of procedure. It was essential to consult on the
                        implications of the French recognition of Communist China, on Berlin and
                        Malaysia, as well as on Cuban trade and credits to the USSR. However, there
                        was little chance of success on the latter two subjects because of the fixed
                        British attitude.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that in his earlier private conversation with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">No record of this conversation has been
                            found.</note> he had asked whether it might be useful for the United
                        States to prepare a paper which would assess the possible erosion of United
                        States public support of NATO if the current trends in NATO continued, such
                        as French recognition of Communist China and a relaxed attitude toward Cuba
                        trade and credits to the USSR. When such a paper was prepared, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> could absent himself
                        while the other fourteen Permanent Representatives discussed it. Usually the
                        question was asked “What is the United States going to do about NATO?” The
                        purpose of the proposed paper would be to seek an answer to the question
                        “What is NATO going to do about the United States?”</p>
                    <p>Noting that the Belgians had been pressing for NATO consultation on the
                        question of French recognition of Communist China, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said that the danger was that the
                        Belgians might interpret NATO's refusal to discuss this question as giving
                        Belgium a free hand to carry out its own explorations with the Communists.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> might feel free to make a
                        trip through Eastern Europe because of a belief that there was no common
                        NATO policy with regard to the Alliance's relationship to the Communist
                        Bloc. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> added that he had
                        attempted to discourage such an interpretation by the Belgians. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PDH1">Popper</persName> pointed out that one of
                        the problems for the United States was that political consultation often
                        seemed untimely because the United States faced specific operational
                        problems which made consultation difficult. For example, one question which
                        had to be considered was whether or not it would be prudent to consult in
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on the Chinese Communist recognition
                        issue in advance of DeGaulle's press conference. In reply to a question from
                        the Secretary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said that
                        five NATO countries now recognize Communist China, observing that as Dutch
                        Foreign Minister he had favored recognition by the Netherlands, although
                        such recognition had taken place before the Korean War. Commenting on our
                        relations with the French, the Secretary said that there was considerable
                        understanding on fiscal matters, some meeting of minds on trade, and that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0042"/>and Messmer<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4"> Pierre A. Messmer, French Defense Minister.</note> seemed to get along
                        well. But there was no area of agreement on the larger political
                            issues.<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> also discussed the May NATO
                            Ministerial Meeting and the relation between NATO civil and military
                            authorities. On the former, <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> believed it was too early to make an
                            appreciation of the meeting; on the latter, he reported that decisions
                            taken by the Standing Group and Military Committee were seldom based on
                            coordinated governmental positions and this often created problems.

                            of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330) <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> developed the problem of relations with NATO
                            military authorities further in a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> on February 4, stating that he was
                            not kept fully informed of their activities and that the only solution
                            was to station a representative of the Secretary General with both the
                            Standing Group and the Military Committee. (Memorandum of conversation;

                    </p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> began by noting that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s influence was to be
                        seen everywhere. He was personally not so worried about the Six in view of
                        the cohesion of the European Community and the internal French pressures in
                        favor of the Common Market which together were too strong to permit the
                        General to break up the Community. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> went on to say that this does not mean the French
                        will be easy to negotiate with. For <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0043"/>instance, at the December Marathon meeting the French got all they wanted
                        while the Germans made all the biggest sacrifices. However, we must
                        anticipate that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would
                        continue to block U.K. entry into the Common Market for this would challenge
                        his dominance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said he was disturbed
                        about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s influence on NATO.
                        He recalled <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s attempt to
                        develop a Tripartite Directorate which he did not get and which would have
                        been highly disruptive. French cooperation since then can be obtained only
                        to the extent that this helps France have its own way. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> added that he thinks a Directorate
                        would not work in any event due to the mounting importance of Germany and
                        the increased influence and pride of Italy. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> insisted that he admired <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> as a man but thought it important to appreciate
                        the extent to which he blocked so many avenues of progress. He does not want
                        to take action and thus presents the alliance with a difficult dilemma of
                        how to react. There will either be hard collisions or we shall have to find
                        some way of working around the General. He felt that a collision is not the
                        way to handle him, that it will not change his position. He said, for
                        instance, that the alliance has not been blocked on an air defense system
                        but had succeeded in working out an arrangement in which there was a degree
                        of French cooperation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>
                        defined this alliance operation as one of mutual respect or tolerance in
                        which the French would not be asked to do things they did not want to do but
                        would not block action by other members of the organization.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> noted, however, that on
                        many occasions when you need <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> suggested that the danger

                        press conference<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s press conference, January

                        accurate impression. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said
                        this was the same type of nationalism Europeans had experienced in earlier
                        periods. The message was one of power of station, and “no one can control
                        me.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> indicated that there
                        are many in France who like this talk and this type of strong man. But what
                        had been and will be the reactions in other countries? The French insist
                        they have to have a nuclear bomb but why will not others insist on the same
                        national prerogative. Right now we have a good democratic government in
                        Germany through such leaders as Erhard, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von

                        <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0044"/>The President said he understood, but
                        asked what we could do about this situation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> went on to say that a
                        somewhat similar situation arose out of the position of the U.K. No member
                        of the alliance should come to the Council with a rigid position. This
                        induces other countries to perform similarly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> referred to the November
                        18 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting on credits. He suggested it
                        must be made clear to the British what their obduracy means. He speculated
                        on whether Home actually realized the significance or the implications of
                        British positions in NATO. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        injected that there would be an opportunity to talk about this matter when
                        the Prime Minister arrived in Washington, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said this was why he was raising
                        the question. He went on to say he was as much worried about what the U.K.
                        is doing now as by the French attitude because both would encourage other
                        countries to act in the same fashion.</p>
                    <p>The President turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                        asked what was the status of the Cyprus matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he was not going off to
                        London today in view of the fact that there seemed to be some flexibility in
                        the Cypriots' position and this would give the British a day or two to see
                        what they could negotiate. He said it was much better for the British to
                        take the lead if they were able and willing to do so. He said it would be
                        necessary to watch Ankara very closely for the next few days. There might be
                        involved a week or so of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said while the immediate
                        problem of Cyprus was not in his compass, nevertheless the implications were
                        of vital importance to NATO. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        was asked whether he thought Makarios <note n="5" xml:id="d7fn5"> Archbishop
                            Makarios III, President of the Cypriot Republic.</note> would accept the
                        proposals put forward, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied he thought there was a possibility he
                        would.</p>
                    <p>The President, turning to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>,
                        said how much he admired his work as Secretary General and the personal
                        sacrifice he was making for NATO. While things were perhaps not as good as
                        we would like them, they were better than we had a right to expect. He said
                        he understood Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s view on
                        France and this was a problem we would have to live with. He said he had had
                        good visits with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Segni and
                        looked forward to seeing Home shortly.</p>

                    <p>5001. Re London 3805.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Telegram 3805, February 7,
                            reported that the British seemed inclined to drag out the deliberations
                            of the Paris Working Group, particularly in light of the expected
                            parliamentary elections. The British also believed that although the
                            political merits of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were
                            obvious, a convincing statement needed to be made on its military
                            benefits. (Ibid.)</note> Department of course agrees need to lay out and
                        achieve clear understanding military justification for <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. However this different from accepting
                        obligation to prove (as UK appears to wish) that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has built-in advantage, in purely military terms, over
                        other strategic weapons systems, since this not our contention. We wish
                        stress concept of military “utility” in discussions with UK and others and
                        do not plan try to demonstrate across-the-board “advantage” which we do not
                        claim. We do believe that in certain respects <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would have advantage over other alternatives which might be
                        considered able to meet desire for strategic nuclear capability under
                        theatre command, e.g. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> cheaper and more
                        quickly available than Polaris subs; it is based on operationally ready
                        system, unlike Missile X; it is more modern and less vulnerable than manned
                        bombers based in Europe. Also, since it would add diversity to overall
                        West's strategic force by introduction new system, it would thereby
                        complicate defensive operation for Soviets and this could be counted as
                        advantage. However, fundamental point is that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be efficient and effective weapons system fully
                        capable fulfilling part of overall Western requirements for next generation
                        missiles. It is not in any sense merely a “political” weapons system,
                        although political purposes it designed to serve are of major
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>Essential fact is that in terms of accuracy, reliability, yield, range, cost
                        and invulnerability <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would meet military
                        criteria which must govern choice of systems programmed for future
                        construction. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, any more than any other
                        single strategic weapons system, is not designed to be simultaneously most
                        accurate, highest yield, longest range, or most invulnerable system in
                        Western arsenal; no such “ideal” weapon exists. However, its particular
                        combination of capabilities and characteristics will ensure <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would have important military role in
                        armory of West's strategic retaliatory forces and be significant
                        contribution to versatility these forces.</p>
                    <p>Neither would <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> simply be unnecessary
                        add-on to West's strategic forces. If <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is
                        built along presently conceived lines, 200 ready well-protected <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0046"/>“in theatre” <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s it would provide would be substituted for other presently
                        programmed external strategic forces.</p>
                    <p>Since <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will be assigned <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, these missiles will be available for
                        inclusion in his Scheduled Program to cover targets on <gloss target="#t_ACE1">ACE</gloss> threat list. These targets presently
                        covered by mix of theatre and external forces, including both aircraft and
                        missiles. With passage of time, and in light of changing
                        technology—including obsolescing aircraft in both US and Europe—and changing
                        nature of Soviet targets, increased Western missile strength—both in theatre
                        and external—will be needed to maintain this effective coverage. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> can contribute to this increased missile
                        strength by furnishing its portion of the mix targeted against Soviet
                        missile sites, airfields and other targets which constitute threat to NATO
                        Europe. In absence <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, other missile forces
                        would have to be procured to maintain this effective coverage.</p>
                    <p> US is convinced on basis thorough study that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> can be fully justified in strictly military terms.
                        Nevertheless we continue to believe some most important arguments in favor
                        are political in nature and it is mistake to look at <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> only from standpoint military aspects. This message does
                        not deal with political factors since apparently UK has found these fully
                        persuasive already.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had introduced
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>, the British Foreign
                        Secretary remarked that it was becoming increasingly clear that there would
                        be much difficulty in deflecting Common Market countries from an autarchic
                        commercial policy. Despite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        and the goodwill of Italy and the Benelux countries, the United Kingdom was
                        not at all sure that the Six could be kept on a liberal trade path. From the
                        British point of view, the Kennedy Round affords a great and unique
                        opportunity for influencing the direction and future of the Six in trade
                        policy. It was a matter of great concern, therefore, to <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> that the Kennedy Round aim of a fifty per
                        cent linear tariff cut might be diminished and eroded by agreement on an
                        unfavorable disparity formula or by a failure of the Six to allow sufficient
                        access to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> markets for exporters of
                        agricultural products. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>
                        noted that the United Kingdom is undertaking a system under which domestic
                        agricultural production will be limited and exporters given a more or less
                        assured share of the market. <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"/>He
                        wondered whether the European position would be in any respect as liberal or
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> replied that we find
                        ourselves in near agreement with the United Kingdom. We too are concerned
                        that the eventual disparity formula may be used by the French to disrupt the
                        entire Kennedy Round, especially if France first were to obtain from its
                        European partners a favorable arrangement for intra-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural trade. We think that the next few weeks should
                        be devoted to probing Common Market intentions, both with respect to
                        disparities and on the Mansholt plan for agriculture. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that the French have said that
                        they do not wish bilateral talks with the United States until the middle of
                        April and he assumed that they hoped in the meantime to get a good
                        settlement within the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> on agriculture. He
                        thought that the French did not necessarily wish the Kennedy Round to
                        succeed but that France's position would depend on intra-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> developments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> wondered whether the
                        decisions taken by the Common Market Ministers in December could be taken to
                        mean that these were final judgments which could not be altered, or whether
                        they were negotiating positions which could be subject to change.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that it seemed
                        to him that the Common Market decisions could scarcely be taken as final
                        since we are considering a process of mutual commercial exchange. Obviously,
                        if the Six were to think about keeping the United States or other suppliers
                        out of Europe, then the United States for its part would have to consider
                        what access should be provided to the American market.</p>
                    <p>Sir Richard Powell said that he did not think the Common Market could have an
                        entirely autarchic end in mind. He did think, however, that the French would
                        be more or less satisfied to have nothing happen in the Kennedy Round. After
                        all, French industry already has been exposed to a large dose of competition
                        within the Common Market. Moreover, there are indications from remarks made
                        by General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and others that
                        the Government of France takes a reserved view about the political
                        importance of the Kennedy Round. Although he had no hard evidence that the
                        French would stand consistently opposed to a sixth round of tariff
                        negotiations, Sir <persName corresp="#p_NRE1">Richard</persName>'s guess was
                        that the French would not be willing to move unless pressure could be
                        exerted on them. Such pressure, he thought, would have to come from Germany
                        and other <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries. The question in his
                        mind was whether the Germans and others would be able to exert enough
                        pressure. He had noted in this connection that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> appeared not to be in a hurry to
                        complete the Kennedy Round.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that this was
                        right, that he was in no great hurry. His concern was with getting a
                        satisfactory end product. He <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0049"/>thought
                        that if we were in good shape by the spring of 1965, the United States would
                        be quite satisfied.</p>
                    <p>The British Foreign Secretary came back to the question of disparities and
                        asked if the United States had an alternative to the Common Market formula
                        to be presented at Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that we have
                        looked very closely at the trade statistics and that, subject to further
                        examination, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> two-to-one formula
                        might not be very damaging to the principle of a 50 per cent cut. This would
                        be particularly the case if we could add the principal supplier criterion or
                        qualification to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> approach. However,
                        more work needed to be done in this area. Sir Richard Powell noted that we
                        have a tactical problem here which also involves the Swiss and the
                        Swedes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> turned then to agriculture
                        and wished to know whether we were prepared to take a more flexible approach
                        in the agricultural sector than in the industrial sector, taking into
                        account the wide range of agricultural commodities involved and the special
                        problems surrounding agriculture in every country.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that the answer
                        was “yes”, that we could entertain special approaches and arrangements for
                        agriculture. He said that the British representatives should remember,
                        however, that the United States is a large agricultural exporter with
                        special interests in agricultural trade.</p>
                    <p>Sir Richard Powell remarked that although British and American interests in
                        the Kennedy Round were very close indeed, UK and US trade configurations
                        were not identical. The UK is not a large agricultural exporter but it does
                        have vital interest in the export of industrial products. The UK exports to
                        the Common Market three times as much as it exports to the United States and
                        most of the British exports are industrial goods. The Foreign Secretary
                        observed at this point that the European Free Trade Area, with 90 million
                        people, would achieve free trade between its member countries by 1966 and
                        already had an overseas trade equal to that of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> summed up the discussion by
                        repeating that the United Kingdom put a very high premium on obtaining a 50
                        per cent linear cut on Free World tariffs through the Kennedy Round. From
                        the British point of view, this was an over-riding objective. The United
                        States, [he] said, could expect from HMG the fullest possible measure of
                        cooperation. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said
                        that we were in very close rapport and that he, for his part, could assure
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> that the United States not
                        only welcomed the statement of British intentions but would be actively
                        consulting the UK at every point during the preliminaries to the Kennedy
                        Round and in the course of the tariff negotiations themselves.</p>

                    <p>Polto 1225. At invitation <gloss target="#t_WG1">WG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> gave his personal views on military
                        value of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> described his requirement for mix of submarine,
                        seaborne, and land based <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s to carry out his assigned mission to
                        deter or defeat Soviet threat to <gloss target="#t_ACE1">ACE</gloss>. At
                        present, he confronted with 600 Soviet missiles, an increasing number being
                        put in hardened sites and he had at his disposal few missiles (US Polaris
                        submarines), (UK V-bombers) and obsolescing strike aircraft which faced
                        excellent improving Soviet air defenses. This missile gap produced decline
                        in his ability discharge mission and weakening of deterrent.</p>
                    <p>While he had no detailed technical information on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> specifications such as warheads, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> stated <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would have
                        great military utility in that it would provide needed missile power which
                        he could use effectively. While <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was no
                        substitute for mix, it would be very considerable contribution toward his
                        mix requirement.</p>
                    <p>In response questions why <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should be
                        created if external forces available for job, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> said every military commander wants forces assigned to
                        him adequate to discharge his mission. When compared with external forces,
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had advantages of flight time,
                        accuracy due to proximity, and survivability due to mobility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> noted greatest accuracy with land
                        based missiles. This advantage compensated for in part by proximity <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to target. While he did not know
                        characteristics of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> warheads, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> stated he had enough targets to be
                        covered by Polaris A–3 missiles far enough from population centers to be
                        consistent with NATO constraints policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> has no great problem in
                        incorporating <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> into NATO Command and
                        Control System, which could be done easily on patterns V-bombers and US
                        Polaris.</p>
                    <p> UK permanent representative said that no decision had been made to create
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and in studying question care must
                        be taken not to overlook other systems that might meet requirement better.
                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> observed this hypothetical
                        situation. He had to consider what was likely to be available to meet three
                        parts of his missile mix. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would meet
                        seaborne part. As for land based missile X, research and development not yet
                        completed. New missiles had lead times of years.</p>

                    <p>In response question of Italian permanent representative, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> emphasized no one single weapons

                    <p>After welcoming the Commissioners the Secretary of State said he hoped it
                        would be of interest to them if he outlined the general situation vis-a-vis
                        the Soviet bloc. While this appeared to be a period of motion he was not
                        sure of the directions but he was sure that the big questions would still be
                        with us, such as Cuba and Viet Nam. He noted there had been small progress
                        made in disarmament but no major movements in that area. It would be
                        incorrect to refer to the situation as one of detente. A new sobriety had
                        been introduced into the East-West relations due to an awareness of the
                        terrible dangers of nuclear war. This new sobriety <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>was one result of the Cuban affair. Southeast Asia remained
                        the point of gravest danger.</p>
                    <p>Turning to trade, the Secretary of State said that this was subject to
                        review, noting the imminent hearings before the Senate which he thought
                        would go on for several months. We did not expect substantial growth in
                        trade due to the limitations of Soviet gold and exchange resources and
                        exports of interest to the United States. In addition the lack of a
                        lend-lease settlement inhibited extension of normal credits. The Secretary
                        of State observed that for the past fifteen years the United States had been
                        a minority of one within the Alliance in East-West trade. Perhaps we had
                        been wrong and our allies right, and maybe as the subject is explored a
                        compromise can be found.</p>
                    <p>With regard to disarmament the Secretary of State said he could not see any
                        early agreement. He thought future steps would be small and might take the
                        form of Khrushchev's policy of “mutual example.” Perhaps agreements could
                        not be written but what may develop would be a “coincidence of policy” as
                        for example in the field of a nondissemination of nuclear arms and
                        reductions of defense spending.</p>
                    <p>Turning to trans-Atlantic relations the Secretary of State observed that some
                        people see only disarray in the Alliance. He wondered if this was an
                        accurate picture and called attention to the extent this disarray seemed to
                        be due to unsolved intra-European problems. In this connection he wished to
                        underline the importance attached to the Kennedy Round. The Secretary
                        thought it a pity that at a time when Khrushchev has so many problems we in
                        the West are forced to mark time. If, in contrast, we were moving strongly
                        towards European integration and Atlantic partnership this would be real
                        strength. Unfortunately we have been diverted, at least temporarily, from
                        this course.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> thanked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> for his welcome and responding to the
                        final point the latter had made suggested breaking the problem down into
                        three areas: economic, political and military. He noted that the process of
                        political union was stalled and that the military problem was at this moment
                        the exclusive property of the individual nations. But he proceeded to
                        outline the rather surprising progress that had been made even during the
                        difficult year of 1963 in the area of economic unity. He felt that from the
                        breakdown of the U.K. negotiations in January 1963 to the successful
                        Marathon meeting before Christmas a basis had developed which would allow
                        the community to move rapidly ahead in 1964. He noted in this connection
                        President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>'s proposal for a
                        further acceleration of the program for eliminating national tariffs. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> also noted the very
                        substantial progress made in the monetary field and his expectations that
                        more would be seen in this area. The fusion of the executives was succeeding
                        and by 1965 the United States would be able to deal with only one
                        commission—although he could not say now <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0054"/>whether it would be 9 or 14. Finally, he stressed that the
                        purpose the community had in mind was to construct a community for the
                        closest possible cooperation with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> also picked up the final
                        point made by the Secretary of State and posed the rhetorical question, “How
                        is Europe going to be organized?” He noted that the veto of U.K. entry was a
                        great shock which had led to questions in the United States as to “Who is
                        Europe?” “Is it <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>?” Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> said this is not true.
                        The European states are “involved in a difficult struggle but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s ideas of Europe are not those
                        we want.” He underscored Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s
                        observations on the remarkable progress that had been made in 1963 despite
                        the internal difficulties. He referred as well to the recommendations being
                        made with respect to the European Parliament.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> accepted the fact that
                        current European tensions preclude progress on political union but suggested
                        that this step is not essential now. While a fully effective Atlantic
                        partnership will need an economically and politically unified Europe it is
                        not possible to give an answer on the political front now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> emphasized that progress in
                        economic unity combined with the mandate given to the Commission by the
                        Council of Ministers to engage in the Kennedy Round is really all that can
                        reasonably be asked for. He furthermore predicted that the end of the
                        negotiations would see success. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> emphasized most strongly that the Kennedy Round is
                        the last chance for the community to show what kind of Europe we are to
                        have. The big problem will be agriculture but he believed these difficulties
                        would be solved as well.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> associated himself with
                        the views of his colleagues. He noted as well the problems and difficulties
                        that lie ahead. He recalled an observation the Secretary of State had made
                        before lunch to the effect that the latter, when asked about Berlin, said he
                        would be content if he could leave the problem in the same shape for his
                        successor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> said that
                        many of these problems such as agriculture could not be solved quickly and
                        would have to be worked over a long time, both within Europe and between
                        Europe and the United States. He called attention to the extent that America
                        had profited from the Common Market with an increase of exports into the
                        community of 80% since 1958. He said the Market had been helpful to the Free
                        World as a whole but he admitted that as in all things matters could have
                        been better.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> noted that the European
                        Community was the United States' child. It would never have come into being
                        without United States support. He suggested that the advantages recited
                        earlier, he hoped, show clearly that the United States had been wise and
                        correct in its policies. By the end of 1965, Marjolin noted, the Common
                        Market would be deciding most economic issues by majority rule. This is the
                        way European federation would come about, dealing first with assorted
                        economic <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0055"/>matters and leaving the
                        “higher issues of policy” to national governments. But these are the
                        important issues of international life, these assorted matters, and he
                        argued that the European Community would continue to be a real partner in
                        its relations with the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State expressed his interest in the observations made by the
                        three Commissioners and suggested that we should give more attention to
                        public information on these matters. Perhaps if people understood the
                        situation better they would see that it was more a sense of disarray than a
                        fact of disarray in our European and Atlantic affairs. By way of analogy he
                        said he was personally not too concerned over the apparent disagreement of
                        strategy within the Alliance for he felt this too was a superficial rather
                        than a real issue. He suggested that when we get down to issues of how we
                        deal with a clear threat then we find there is much greater unity than we
                        had thought to be the case. He concluded by saying that he wanted to be sure
                        we gave more attention to the public affairs aspects of the Atlantic
                        Community.</p>

                        Ministerial Meeting in May, his views on the central issues confronting the
                        Alliance. He could do this, he said, in a particularly appropriate way
                        because it would be his last such appraisal.</p>
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> saw it, NATO's principal
                        problem today was that the rule of unanimity, as exploited mainly by the
                        French, stood increasingly in the way of a satisfactory NATO organization.
                        He suggested that a practice adopted in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> might be initiated in NATO to overcome this problem, at
                        least in part. In <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, if a member
                        disapproved of action desired by the majority, that member could abstain
                        from participation while other members went ahead without it. This was in
                        accord with what should be a basic doctrine of an Alliance—that no member
                        should compel another to take action against its will; but on the other
                        hand, no one member should be able to prevent others from taking necessary
                        action. The proposal was consistent with the doctrine from taking necessary
                        action. The proposal was consistent with the doctrine of “mutual
                        forebearance” which <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> had
                        previously advocated. It had in fact been applied in the case of the
                        Multilateral Force, where the French were standing aside passively, but it
                        would be much easier to move in this way if the action could be taken within
                        rather than outside NATO and if it could be explained as a NATO action. This
                        was not the case with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that there were two kinds of vetoes in organizations
                        such as NATO and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There was what might
                        be called the parliamentary veto, and there was the de facto veto arising
                        out of the need for physical participation by the disagreeing state. Thus, a
                        project like the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could proceed without
                        French acquiescence, but in a matter like the establishment of a control
                        post system it was impossible to force the French to permit control posts to
                        be established on their territory against their will.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> noted that NATO had
                        managed to cope with French objections with respect to the Athens Guidelines
                        and the Inter-Allied Nuclear Force; but that if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were established by action outside NATO there would be
                        serious difficulties if <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> participants
                        wanted to establish its headquarters in France or have <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> vessels armed with nuclear weapons enter
                        French ports. An abstention doctrine in NATO might help in meeting such
                        problems or at least make the position of NATO Permanent Representatives
                        easier if they were to serve on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        Board of Governors. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
                        commented that the French were perfectly willing to let the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> go ahead without them so long as French
                        territory and facilities were not involved; if they were, the French could
                        be expected to be far more difficult. The Secretary-General added that there
                        were bound to be serious difficulties with the French in any event in
                        working out such problems as the legal status of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> personnel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0057"/>At this point <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said that he had in mind suggesting
                        the abstention doctrine in the Annual Political Appraisal. The Secretary
                        thought that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s
                        personal views on this matter might be included in a personal annex to the
                        Appraisal designed for Ministers only, and that a discussion of the
                        Secretary General's views on basic NATO problems might perhaps take place in
                        a small private session for Foreign Ministers.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that in the last three years, during <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s incumbency, NATO had gone much
                        farther in discussion of matters outside the NATO area than had previously
                        been the case. Perhaps in his Appraisal the Secretary-General could
                        speculate as to whether this had been a good idea and had been helpful, and
                        whether the practice could be expanded. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> mentioned the recently established procedure of
                        opening all <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meetings with a period of
                        political consultation. He said it was highly popular. There was no problem
                        in persuading members to participate. The important thing was the countries
                        should not enter upon consultation with rigid positions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then remarked that for several years ahead, barring war or
                        intense crisis, disarmament questions would be coming regularly before
                        governments and would be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.
                        Four NATO members were represented at Geneva, a fifth having decided not to
                        sit in, and the question therefore arose whether there should be more
                        permanent machinery in NATO to deal with disarmament problems. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> thought not. The Council and the
                        Committee of Political Advisers dealt with these problems quite adequately;
                        there was a regular fortnightly report from Geneva; and these organs could
                        take up any particular items, with the aid of experts, at any time.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> referred to the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions of the observation post
                        problem. Here the difficulty was that the Standing Group had refused to
                        produce adequate military advice in the absence of political guidance, while
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> had been hampered by the absence of
                        a useful military report. Given the resulting deadlock, <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> had posted a chart with a
                        hypothetical system, and this he said had stimulated the British and later
                        the Americans to produce papers, including specific observation post
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> continued that in his opinion
                        there was something institutionally wrong with the Standing Group, and that
                        he would like to refer to this subject in his Annual Political Appraisal. On
                        the most important matters, such as observation posts and strategy, one
                        could not get a useful opinion out of them; consequently, <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> had to use national experts, drawn from
                        each member state. He thought the Standing Group problem was becoming worse.
                        Essentially the difficulty was that the Standing Group was multi-national,
                        so that if one member said “no” most of the time, effective action was
                        impossible.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that once military problems got beyond the field
                        commander level, they were intermingled with political factors. In such
                        situations it was difficult for Standing Group members to furnish purely
                        military advice. And so, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>
                        added, these matters came to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and
                        were decided there. If a war situation ever occurred, the Standing Group, he
                        thought, simply could not function. It would be necessary to improvise a
                        much higher level body. In the present circumstances, he felt something must
                        be done about the relationship between the political and military sides of
                        NATO. The military acted as a clan apart from others. They were not subject
                        to political control until matters reached the action stage. They were
                        reluctant to keep the Secretary-General informed and thus often got into
                        difficulties—as for example in the present case of the Italian protest over
                        the International Planning Staff proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">On
                            March 11, the Italian Ambassador had complained to Under Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> that the
                            filling of a new position in the Standing Group by a German officer
                            would violate the spirit of understanding between the United States and
                            Italy that Italy would have a larger role in the group. (Memorandum of
                            conversation, March 11; ibid., DEF 4 NATO)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary referred to other possible changes in NATO organization. He
                        asked whether it would help if we made the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> a standing body at the Ministerial level. This would not
                        result in any great change for the US Government, but could other
                        governments do it? <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said that
                        his own experience was that in a parliamentary system of government only the
                        cabinet was responsible and could make top-level decisions. The Foreign
                        Minister could not evade or share his individual responsibility. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> pointed out that the
                        exploration of this subject, which the Secretary had commissioned Mr. Rostow
                        and him to make at the December 1962 meeting, had produced rather negative
                        results. The Secretary nevertheless felt that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> decisions did not carry the weight they should carry among
                        governments. If <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> were constituted at the
                        Ministerial level this might make a difference, and Foreign Ministers would
                        have to be called together only when some specific circumstances required
                        their participation, and not regularly whether or not needed. The
                        Secretary-General said that meetings twice a year were highly desirable from
                        the international standpoint because such regularity helped to produce
                        necessary papers and precipitate decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether there was a broad consensus within NATO with
                        respect to Eastern Europe or whether it would be useful to discuss Eastern
                        European problems at the May Meeting in greater detail. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> felt there was considerable
                        agreement on the facts, but there were great differences of view on whether
                        there should be active negotiations <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0059"/>with Eastern European countries. The negative French position made it
                        difficult to proceed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested there might not be fundamental agreement on the
                        significance and implications of what was happening in Eastern Europe. We in
                        the US were much more cautious than others in assuming that there was an
                        East-West detente, even though on the other hand we were criticized by some
                        nations for going too far in negotiation. Perhaps the negative French
                        position was based on the French view that there just was not going to be
                        any war. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> agreed, stating
                        that the French were doubtless using the US military umbrella in striking
                        their attitudes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wished the French would fill out the gaps in their position.
                        They said they were dissatisfied with NATO organization; in his recent
                        interview with the US News and World Report <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> had refused to spell out the changes the
                        French would like to see, on the ground that no one would agree with them;
                        perhaps a logical deduction was that we should go ahead as we now are until
                        we do agree on the changes to be made. The Secretary-General said that the
                        Canadians, Belgians and Dutch all favored consideration of this problem. His
                        French sources (<persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGJC1">De la Grandville</persName>) had left some doubt in
                        his mind as to how the French would react to such a discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. The latter had said that the French could
                        accept it but would remain silent. If the Secretary-General were to suggest
                        an abstention doctrine, he would carefully refrain from singling out the
                        French in any special way.</p>
                    <p>In further discussion of French motives <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> said he had heard a report, not corroborated, that
                            <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss>'s negotiations with the
                        French for naval cooperation after the recent withdrawal of French naval
                        forces from commitment had failed. An arrangement had been made between the
                        Admirals concerned, but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                        turned it down. In <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s mind,
                        this was a serious development. If NATO was to function effectively in war,
                        arrangements for coordination would have to be made before the war
                        started.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary supposed that when the imminence of the military threat
                        decreased, it was natural that there should be less concern for the strength
                        of an Alliance. He thought we in the United States had had considerable
                        success in maintaining our military alertness and strength, but he was not
                        so sure about the Europeans. The Secretary-General said that the Germans too
                        had kept up their guard, but this was no longer true in Belgium. It was hard
                        to make a judgment about Norway and Denmark (the Secretary commented that
                        Foreign Minister Lange had realistically remarked that we had not yet
                        reached the promised land); the UK was concerned with internal problems but
                        had somewhat increased its defense budget; and in Italy, Segni, Saragat and
                        Andreotti had kept the Italians in a good position.</p>

                    <p>Concluding the discussion <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>
                        asked whether the Secretary agreed that he might carefully bring the
                        fundamental NATO problem to the attention of the May Meeting. The Secretary
                        stressed the need for care; he did not think we should raise these issues
                        just because Foreign Ministers found them more entertaining than a routine
                        review of current developments; but with reasonable care he thought the
                        Ministers should be able to discuss with each other the central issues of
                        the Alliance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> remarked that
                        this 15th anniversary meeting was an appropriate occasion for doing so. The
                        Secretary expressed the hope that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> would have a private discussion of the subject with
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> at the Bilderberg

                    <p>d. Most dangerous in long term, implicit reduction of political content of

                    <p>Dear Doug:</p>
                    <p>The Secretary has asked me to reply to your letter of February 26 and March
                            16,<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">In the February 26 letter, MacArthur
                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> wanted to
                            review the North Atlantic Treaty because he believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was trying to destroy NATO
                            and the review would smoke him out. (Ibid., DEF 4 NATO) The March 16
                            letter has not been found.</note> in which you describe Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s proposal to raise at the
                        NATO Ministerial Meeting in The Hague in May the question <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0062"/>of a review of the North Atlantic Treaty. My
                        comments are also directed to your letter of March 23 addressed to me.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">In this letter, MacArthur reiterated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was very serious about
                            a review of NATO to arrest the existing “erosive drift” in the
                            organization. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As you know from my memorandum of March 19 to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">Not found.</note> I
                        have serious difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s
                        proposal. It is not that we in the Department disagree fundamentally with
                        his analysis of the current state of affairs in NATO. Like <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, we tend to react with frustration
                        and exasperation to the day-to-day conflicts which arise predominantly,
                        though not exclusively, from French obstruction. (Recall, for example, the
                        recent performance of the British on trade and credits matters.) We
                        recognize that if present trends continue, the result might ultimately be
                        disastrous for NATO and unfortunate for all its members. We believe,
                        however, that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> tends to
                        disregard the substratum of solidarity that still prevails in NATO. While
                        the outlook is certainly not encouraging, we do not consider it
                        desperate.</p>
                    <p>The problem <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">M. Spaak</persName> presents is
                        whether, in this situation, forcing the issue of NATO reorganization through
                        the appointment of a review group would help us or harm us in coping with
                        the French. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> seems willing to
                        contemplate with relative equanimity the possibility of a breakup of NATO as
                        a result of the French reaction to what would probably be considered a
                        drastic anti-French proposal. I very much doubt, however, that other NATO
                        members would enter joyously into such a conflict; certainly we here would
                        have grave reservations about it at this moment. Indeed, with elections
                        approaching in the UK and the US, German nervousness on security and
                        Alliance problems in general, and the precariousness of the Italian internal
                        situation, I think the time is quite unpropitious for embarking on such an
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, in further discussion with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, you might assure him that we share his determination
                        that the French must not be allowed to sabotage NATO. But we do not believe
                        that the moment has yet come to initiate a “Wise Men's” review which would
                        only highlight the problem and, as <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">M.
                            Spaak</persName> has recognized, would provoke a confrontation with the
                        French. For the time being we would prefer a more subtle approach in which
                        we might take steps to keep NATO moving without French participation,
                        wherever the French chose to remain aloof. That is why we have responded
                        sympathetically to <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s recent
                        suggestion that we try to adopt in certain cases the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> practice of moving ahead on specific
                        problems where there is an opposition of one, allowing the others to proceed
                        on their own while the dissenter stands aside.<note n="5" xml:id="d14fn5">See <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> If we <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0063"/>could generalize this practice, there would
                        be many ways in which we could proceed in spite of the French.</p>
                    <p>Through this type of procedure we might apply a steady if undramatic pressure
                        on the French. We would try to act in such a way that the responsibility
                        would be centered on them, rather than on us, for provoking a crisis.
                        Hopefully it would then become clear to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> that he would risk isolation if he persisted in trying
                        to block NATO activities supported by all other Members.</p>
                    <p>As for the May Meeting at The Hague, we expect that <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Dirk Stikker</persName> may very well refer in his
                        Annual Political Appraisal to certain fundamental problems confronting NATO,
                        and we will surely wish to comment on them—in a careful and a
                        non-contentious way. We hope the Secretary will reaffirm our view that NATO
                        and its institutions will continue to be necessary for Western security as
                        far ahead as we can see. We also hope that, recognizing the complexities of
                        the emerging East-West situation, he will make some allusion to the need for
                        keeping NATO in step with new developments so that it may continue to be a
                        flexible and effective instrument of North Atlantic policy.</p>
                    <p>We know that NATO cannot continue in existence indefinitely without changes
                        in its structure and functions. That is why we have applauded <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s efforts to increase NATO's
                        cooperation in non-military and non-European affairs as well as to improve
                        NATO's general effectiveness. Nevertheless, we think a “Wise Men's” review
                        of NATO would be premature at this juncture. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> would agree that the idea of such a
                        review might be thrown out at the May Meeting as an item for further
                        consideration as we approach the 20th anniversary of the North Atlantic
                        Treaty. In the context of a general modernization operation, such a review
                        would be less likely to antagonize the French and more likely to produce
                        results. We would not, however, think it desirable actually to set up a
                        panel of “Wise Men” until, at the earliest, the December 1964 NATO
                        Ministerial Meeting.</p>
                    <p>Given the penetrating character of <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s thinking on all these issues, we hope you can induce
                        him to review the subject in this broader context. We would be most
                        interested to know what reaction he gets from his exploration with other

                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had visited
                            The Hague on March 26 and discussed with the Dutch the idea of
                            undertaking a basic review of NATO at the Council meeting in May. While
                            no decision was reached, both sides agreed that such a proposal might be
                            useful in forcing the French to take a definite stand on the future of
                            the Alliance. In telegram 4548 from Paris, March 28, <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had frequently made clear his
                            view that the Atlantic Alliance was “of indefinite value,” but also
                            believed that the organization, as distinct from the Alliance, should
                            undergo certain unspecified changes. (Department of State, Central

                            around the world that fitted this picture, stated that the French wanted
                            to alter NATO but refused to say how, and concluded that there were
                            still many areas where French influence or action could be crucial so it
                            was necessary to consider carefully what should be done and how.

                    <p>At the meeting of the North Atlantic Council on April 3, 1964, NATO Secretary
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Dirk Stikker</persName> announced his
                        intention to resign. He had previously informed Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> of this decision, and on March 23
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> sent a message to Norwegian
                        Foreign Minister Halvard Lange, British Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>, and Canadian Prime Minister Lester
                        Pearson expressing his hope that the European members of the Alliance could
                        agree on a successor, thus avoiding the difficult situation that occurred in
                        selecting <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> in 1961.
                        (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 4 NATO)</p>
                    <p>On April 4, Italian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> informed Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> that Italy felt justified in laying
                        claim to the position. (Memorandum for the Secretary, April 4; ibid., NATO
                        8–3) On April 21, the Italian Government officially proposed <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Manlio Brosio</persName>, who had also been a candidate
                        when <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName> was selected, and 2 days
                        later the United Kingdom proposed Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Harold
                            Caccia</persName>. Following further discussion between Italy and the
                        United Kingdom, the British withdrew their candidacy and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was elected Secretary General.</p>

                    <p>Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>
                        started the discussion by reviewing the progress of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He discussed the rationale of the concept,
                        stressing the danger of perpetuating German discrimination and emphasizing
                        the need for giving the Germans a legitimate role in the defense of the
                        Alliance, but “on a leash.” He thought there was substantial possibility of
                        reaching informal agreement on the terms of a charter this spring and summer
                        and charter-signing ceremonies by the end of the year. He said the
                        Department had been conducting informal consultations with Congressional
                        leaders and the results were favorable. Thus far, there was no evidence of
                        opposition. Therefore, he felt the time had come for broader consultations
                        with the key Congressional committees concerned.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> supplemented
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s remarks by reporting
                        on the progress of the Paris Working Group. He told the President the
                        educational phase had about reached its end and the time had come to move
                        into the action phase. The way had been prepared for drafting the charter
                        and if the President would give the go-ahead sign, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be accepted by a number of
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the President's question about the views on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> within the United States Government, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said there was a consensus
                        supporting it, but that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had serious reservations. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, he said, could provide an Atlantic
                        solution to the problem of the nuclear defense of the West and weaken French
                        and British determination to hold on to their national nuclear
                        establishments provided it were not forced upon the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> said it was his
                        view that the U.S. had to stop being diffident about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold
                            Wilson</persName> told him bluntly the British <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>had the impression that President Johnson, as President
                        Kennedy, was not really interested in the project. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> also expressed concern about the
                        situation. He said the American attitude had complicated the problem for the
                        Italians, since <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> kept
                        insisting that the U.S. really did not want the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName>
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> to urge the President
                        to give specific endorsement to the project so there would be no
                        misunderstanding the American position. Moreover, it was Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName>'s view that even a
                        Wilson government would join the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He was
                        sure that in the long run <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        would do what the U.S. wanted and therefore it was important to tell him
                        that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was good for the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        added that the British in general, and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold
                            Wilson</persName> in particular, wanted to discourage the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, preferring instead to run the U.S.
                        deterrent. But the British would go back to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> if the United States made it clear that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was the only alternative for them.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> pointed
                        out that we had to take cognizance of the forthcoming British elections and
                        did not want to handle the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in such a way
                        as to complicate the campaign.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> interjected to say the
                        President ought to be aware of the Soviet Union's strongly negative views on
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, citing Soviet attacks on the
                        project at Geneva. He also warned against tying U.S. hands in such way that
                        it could be immobilized in future disarmament and non- dissemination
                        discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he would
                        be happy if we could move on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> with
                        “all deliberate speed.” As for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s view (as described in the Secretary's memorandum to
                        the President)<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">A copy of this 4-page memorandum

                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> less objectionable than the kinds of
                            <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> arrangements that might come about
                        in its absence. There is no evidence <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is
                        preventing conclusions of disarmament agreements that the Soviets might
                        otherwise favor and that would be in our interest,”—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> said he disagreed with that
                        estimate. It did not coincide with his impressions from his talks with the
                        Soviets at Geneva.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting the President directed that:</p>
                    <p>(1) The Department of State broaden its discussions with the Congress on the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and begin informal briefings of the
                        committees concerned.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Europeans be told that in his judgment the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was the best way to proceed. The President also felt the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could satisfy the pride and
                        self-respect of the Europeans but warned against trying to shove the project
                        down the throats of the potential participants.</p>
                    <p>(3) If possible, agreement on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> be
                        reached by the end of the year.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0067"/>
                    <p>As for the public presentation, the President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> to talk with the press
                        immediately after the White House meeting and explain that he reported to
                        the President on the problems of the Alliance and the progress on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The President cautioned Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> against giving the
                        press the details of the discussion in advance of Congressional briefings.
                        However, he thought the Ambassador ought to refer to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> portions of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s speech of April 7,<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s

                            2873.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Telegram 2873 to Bonn, April 15,
                            instructed <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and/or <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> to inform them of the
                            decisions taken at the White House meeting on April 10. (Ibid.,

                                <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> (in the absence from Bonn of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>) saw the Chancellor at noon today.
                        State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>, and Assistant Secretary
                        Krapf were also present. After <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> had made
                        the points in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> described the Friday White House
                        meeting in which he said the entire question of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> policy had been thoroughly covered. The President had
                        carefully considered the subject and was fully cognizant of the need to move
                        ahead. The study phase has now ended and we must now go into an action
                        phase. <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> added that he had
                        received specific instructions in Washington on the work to be done in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>After reviewing the British and Italian situation, as well as the
                        relationship of Cyprus to Turkish and Greek participation, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> noted that the time set for U.S.
                        adherence to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Charter seemed to be
                        the earliest appropriate since 1964 and [sic] was a U.S. election year. We
                            <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0068"/>wanted to be sure that a tight
                        schedule was maintained both in Washington and in Paris, where work would
                        proceed parallelly, in order to reach our objective before the end of 1964.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> observed that close
                        German cooperation would be required in order to enable us to exercise the
                        strong leadership necessary. We believed that U.K. would eventually come in,
                        though it might not be prepared to do so at first. We also thought that the
                        concrete situation was such as to favor other governments joining <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said the President could be
                        assured of continuing German support of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in which his country had a large stake both for political
                        and technical military reasons. As far as France was concerned, without
                        denying the existence of the Franco-German treaty, the Germans wanted to
                        avoid any suspicion that they sought any part in the French “force de
                        frappe.” A major point favoring the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was
                        that it would tie the U.S. and Germany together in Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> then reviewed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> situation in various countries he had
                        recently visited. He was convinced that the U.K. would eventually come in,
                        even under a Labor government. In Italy at first there had been real
                        distrust of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In response to Italian
                        fears regarding French hegemony and the implications of the “force de
                        frappe,” he had found a particularly effective argument to be that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was the best way to neutralize the
                        “force de frappe”. Even Nenni had seemed persuaded by this. Dutch
                        participation was not 100 percent clear, but he thought they would come in.
                        As to Germany, there could be no doubt about its adherence. Among other
                        things, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> provided a useful argument
                        against Soviet charges that contemporary German leaders were revanchist.
                        Their joining would be the best proof that they had no nationalist
                        aspirations in the weapons field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> went on to say that there would
                        be no trouble in getting the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> through the
                        Bundestag. While there were some opponents, these were not significant. This
                        was essentially a bipartisan issue on which the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would support the government.</p>
                    <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s query,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> said he did not believe
                        the U.S. Congress provided any basic problem on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In espousing the policy on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> which had been explained to the Chancellor, the President
                        had expressed his confidence that the Congress would approve the Charter
                        which would be negotiated. In response to a further query, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> added he did not think this would
                        be an issue between the parties in the U.S. There was nothing in the
                        Republican tradition which would necessitate their opposing the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> added that it was, of course,
                        important that as many countries as possible be brought into the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> observed that we wanted this too. However, the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was a daring innovation necessary to
                        the solidarity of the West. People did not always take kindly to new <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0069"/>ideas, and this was a subject which
                        had not yet demonstrated mass appeal. There was a real need of leadership
                        and of German cooperation with us in the Paris Working Group. We were
                        convinced that support for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would
                        snowball once it became indisputable that it was going to succeed. People
                        would come to recognize it as indispensable to the kind of solidarity which
                        the West requires.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> observed that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> had made clear that we
                        were moving into a new phase in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        discussions. This would involve intensive U.S.-German discussions required
                        to keep the momentum up. These might become public, in fact it might be
                        desirable that they do so. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        commented that the German Government would not seek publicity in this
                        matter, but it was clear that such cooperation between the two countries was
                        necessary to progress. He did not fear that public discussion of this
                        cooperation would cause any trouble in Germany.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> noted that Germany was the
                        first country to hear directly of the results of the Washington decisions.
                        An important start had been made by the U.S. making clear its intentions. An
                        intense effort was not required to achieve the desired goal by the end of
                        the year. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> reiterated that the
                        President could be told that Germany was fully prepared to cooperate. He
                        looked forward to discussing this subject further during his anticipated
                        meeting with the President in June.</p>
                    <p>Comment: This was a highly useful launching of consultations following upon
                        the White House meeting. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was
                        well briefed and gave unqualified support to the action program implied in
                        the schedule presented to him. Although the Foreign Office was represented
                        at this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> plans to
                        return to Bonn early next week to meet with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> (who will be in Bonn for a few days before leaving
                        for his Latin American trip with Luebke), and possibly <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>, to have more detailed
                        discussions of specific work involved during the balance of 1964.</p>

                    <p>Secto 59. Eyes only for Acting Secretary from Secretary. Reference Polto 1 of
                        April 14,<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">In this telegram, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> raised the issue of whether
                            to “force” the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> on the Europeans.
                            Referring to the White House meeting on April 10, he stated that it
                            indicated that the United States would take no action to achieve the
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> unless the Allies asked for it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> proposed that a
                            middle ground between “force” and permissiveness be staked out urging
                            the Allies “courteously and without pressure” to accept the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> for the common good. He concluded that
                            anything less than this would be “misunderstood by Allies who cannot
                            understand that most powerful member of Alliance is as diffident as all
                            that.” (Ibid., DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>))</note> I find
                        it difficult to be patient in face of whining from various quarters across
                        the Atlantic. <gloss target="#t_reftel1">Reftel</gloss> should have broken
                        down words Europe and Europeans into their component parts because on these
                        matters there is no such thing as Europe. It is elementary that there will
                        be no <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> unless a representative grouping
                        of NATO countries wants it and that there will be an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> if they do. I told <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> and others just prior to White House meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">See <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note>
                        that I was unable to make a personal commitment to support <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> with only Germany, Greece and Turkey. It is
                        also elementary to me that the United States does not expose itself to a
                        major prestige setback by pretending that the American Republic and NATO
                        will come crumbling down if at the end of the day Italy and Great Britain
                        decide they want none of it. I do not know why we cannot deal with this
                        matter in a businesslike fashion as a constructive worthwhile move without
                        involving it with a second coming of Christ.</p>
                    <p>I am also concerned about the attitude around NATO headquarters toward
                        disarmament. Every NATO government in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        has voted regularly for disarmament and many of them have pushed us at times
                        in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere to go farther and faster
                        than we thought wise. Our responsibility toward this arms race is to try to
                        prevent this globe from becoming a cinder and we must be forgiven if we try
                        to get on with it even if others are hypnotized by toys and gadgets which
                        they themselves only dimly understand. My own view is that we should get on
                        with both the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and disarmament. If we get
                        to a point, which I doubt, where we are forced to make some choices between
                        the two, responsible governments should consult with each other and decide
                        what to do. This is in no sense an unusual problem. It arises in connection
                        with the armament of <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0071"/>the United
                        States, NATO force goals, US commitments about divisions in Europe and many
                        other problems.</p>
                    <p>What I would like to see, therefore, is a little more maturity on these
                        matters, but I doubt we can achieve it; but I do not want us to appear
                        apologetic, defensive or embarrassed. No Foreign Minister has whined to me
                        in terms like Polto 1 and until they do I am not much interested in lesser
                        fry.</p>

                    <p>During the course of a talk with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> at the British Embassy at 6 PM on
                        Sunday, April 26, the Secretary said he would like to raise the subject of
                        the multilateral force. He said we would like to do something on this before
                        the end of 1964. He noted this would fit the Italian book. He realized that
                        the fact that the UK was having elections in October made it awkward for Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>. He added that we consider
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> important and that it will come into
                        being. However, we didn't want to create difficulties for the British
                        Government.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> replied that the Prime
                        Minister had asked him to put to the Secretary the British position very
                        bluntly. This was that the U.K. Government could not take a position on the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> before elections. If necessary, the
                        Prime Minister would have to take this subject up with the President. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> added that the U.K. had
                        raised the idea of a mixed-manned bomber force. This, however, was not an
                        alternative to the sea force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> also noted that the project for an experimental ship
                        was under way with British support, and the U.K. had thought this was their
                        bit prior to the October elections.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that even if we did agree to the UK proposal on bombers
                        at the present time, the UK still couldn't move. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> replied that this was correct. He
                        added that he didn't want to see a rift with the US because of political
                        difficulties. He realized that it was better to have the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> than for the Germans to have their own
                        nuclear force, but he still couldn't move before elections.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he understood this. He would like to know,
                        however, what the limits were on the British to consult prior to the final
                        decision. Could they participate in the preparation of a draft agreement?
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> replied he would have to
                        consult on this but in any event the British would have to reserve their
                        position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Lord Harlech</persName> said perhaps it would be
                        possible to prepare the agreement in some form other than as a draft treaty.
                        The Secretary said that this might be a working group report on what should
                        be in the articles of agreement, but in such form as to be readily
                        transformable into a treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said he would like to emphasize that it was essential
                        that he be in a position to say to Parliament until it rises that the
                        government had made no commitment. It would, therefore, be awkward if any
                        document prepared were called a draft treaty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Lord Harlech</persName> said it was also
                        important that the government be able to indicate that the new UK proposals
                        were not being brushed aside.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said if the UK proposals became a substitute for ships or a
                        device to postpone agreement it would not be good.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said that it should be
                        possible to avoid a milestone in June which had inevitably to be followed by
                        negotiations. After relating the German situation on timing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> came to the conclusion that anything
                        produced after January would cause trouble. The Secretary said he thought
                        the best thing to do would be to prepare a report which could be turned into
                        an agreement promptly after the UK elections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> also emphasized that he would not
                        want to see the new UK proposals delay progress on the seaborne force.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Lord Harlech</persName> replied that it was
                        important in the UK that the UK proposals be considered. The Secretary
                        replied that he understood this, but that it would not be desirable for the
                        UK proposals to be discussed as alternatives to a seaborne force. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said this had never been
                        suggested. The Secretary concluded the discussion <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0073"/>by saying that he would pull this together for further
                        discussion Monday and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
                        to get in touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Gerard
                            Smith</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">At a second meeting on
                            April 27, the two sides reached the following “Conclusions of
                            Anglo/American Discussions about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>”:“1. The UK will not be expected to take any steps on the
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> prior to October which could be
                            construed as a commitment by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>.”2. It
                            is assumed that in the interim the Working Group in Paris will continue

                            for decision in November or December 1964.“3. The UK stated its
                            intention to submit detailed technical support data for the proposals

                    </list>
                    <p>After dinner at the Soviet Embassy, Ambassador Dobrynin asked me whether the
                        United States intended to move ahead with the Multilateral Force. I said we
                        were and that the Working Group in Paris had been making good progress. He
                        said that he was very sorry to hear this as it would make things difficult
                        for both of us. I said that this opinion was certainly based on a
                        misunderstanding of what the Multilateral Force was going to be. I said
                        that, on the contrary, the Soviet Government should be pleased at a solution
                        which permits non-nuclear powers to participate in nuclear arrangements
                        without acquiring national control over nuclear weapons or their release.
                        The Ambassador said that the Multilateral Force would only satisfy the
                        German appetite for nuclear weapons for two or three years, after which
                        Germany would insist on <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0074"/>acquiring
                        nuclear weapons for itself. I said that, on the contrary, the Federal
                        Republic of Germany would be satisfied at playing the role of a full and
                        equal partner in the Alliance by participating in the Multilateral Force. I
                        added that, in spite of the difference in our present opinions and
                        assessment of the role of the Multilateral Force, I felt sure that the
                        Soviet Union would eventually recognize that far from increasing the risk of
                        the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Force was so organized and
                        controlled as to satisfy the security requirements of both the Soviet Union
                        and of the United States.</p>

                        we should continue to provide funds as necessary to Slice XVI, with an
                        overall ceiling of 50 million pounds ($140 million) at our current cost
                        share of 30.85%. The proposed reply also cautioned against extensive
                        pressure on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> at this time in order
                        not to jeopardize current offset negotiations with the Germans. The letter
                        further pointed out that it would be undesirable from a U.S. point of view
                        for the Germans to become the major contributor to NATO infrastructure,
                        thereby eroding or counteracting U.S. influence on this major NATO program.
                            (<hi rend="italic">End of Background</hi>)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated his concern regarding the high cost of infrastructure
                        and the changed economic conditions both in Europe and the United States. He
                        emphasized that our allies are not shouldering an equitable share of the
                        overall NATO defense burden. He observed that the Europeans pay for no
                        defense infrastructure here so he wondered why we should continue to pay for
                        infrastructure in Europe. He was not sure the infrastructure principle for
                        establishing cost sharing was “good enough”. He believed it necessary for
                        the allies to take on more of the multilateral costs in the European
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> agreed that the allies should
                        assume a greater share of the NATO defense burden. They pointed out,
                        however, that the issue at the moment is how to handle the short term
                        problem of funding Slice XVI. They believed that any serving of an ultimatum
                        by the Secretary of Defense on the allies which threatened to contribute no
                        new funds to Slice XVI would seriously jeopardize our longer term interest
                        in the program and would be thoroughly disruptive within NATO generally.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that we are in a “desperate situation” regarding
                        our costs in comparison to those of Europe and that the allies “will not
                        move unless we are harsh”. Unless the United States starts now it will be
                        too late. He agreed with the Secretary of Defense that we should start
                        negotiations now for a substantially reduced share and that our proportion
                        should be not more than 25%. He said that politically, it would be of great
                        advantage if we could get our cost share of infrastructure down to 25%. The
                        Secretary said he was bothered by the tone of the proposed State letter to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> felt that the possibility of a collapse
                            <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0076"/>in the infrastructure program if
                        the U.S. contributed no new funds to Slice XVI was only one side of the
                        coin. We should also consider that the other side of this coin is that the
                        allies must have our consent for these programs. He asked again why the
                        United States should pay for facilities in Europe when the allies do not pay
                        for our facilities in the United States. It was explained that the
                        infrastructure facilities are for support of the NATO forces in general,
                        including our own. He was advised that there is a very small amount of NATO
                        infrastructure in the United States at <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> headquarters at Norfolk. The concept of obtaining NATO
                        funding for other U.S. defense installations within the continental limits
                        is being considered, pro and con, in the interagency study on infrastructure
                        soon to be forwarded for his approval. At this point the Secretary said he
                        was less interested in having the Europeans share the costs here in the
                        United States but he firmly believed that the Europeans should assume an
                        increased share of the cost in Europe.</p>
                    <p>In response to numerous questions from the Secretary, Mr. Conroy and Mr.
                        Blitgen described the composition and geographic distribution of the
                        infrastructure program, the method and criterion for developing both the
                        annual and long term programs, the timing involved, the cost shares and
                        method for determining these shares, the financing of usership charges and
                        the relationship of these charges to the infrastructure budget and the
                        status of certain individual projects such as <gloss target="#t_NADGE1">NADGE</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        asked what would be the effect of ending infrastructure. He was informed
                        that this was a matter which had never really been seriously considered
                        until now, that these infrastructure facilities formed a major system of
                        fixed facilities in support of NATO combat forces, and that a cessation of
                        the program would have very far reaching repercussions. The Secretary asked
                        if the host country did not derive an ultimate economic benefit from the
                        investment in facilities on its territory. If so he asked why the host
                        country shouldn't pay a larger share in anticipation of this benefit. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> and Mr. Weiss said that
                        such an arrangement presumes that the facility would be withdrawn from NATO
                        use, an eventuality we would be reluctant to concede in advance. Mr. Conroy
                        and Mr. Blitgen also explained that in seeking to develop individual cost
                        shares for a long term program, the contributive capacity of the individual
                        nations, and the economic benefits of the infrastructure projects to the
                        host nations are considered. Certain local costs such as public utilities
                        services, access roads and land are contributed by the host nations and
                        these costs are substantial. In the last analysis, however, the cost shares
                        are determined by “horse-trading” at the conference table and these
                        negotiations are usually arduous. If infrastructure projects were
                        surrendered at some later date as no longer useful to NATO, a problem of
                        determining the residual value of the facilities, i.e., how much the host
                        nation should pay back to the other allies for obtaining full title to and
                        use of the <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0077"/>installations, would
                        arise. This problem has not confronted the Alliance to date in any
                        significant way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> and others emphasized that
                        they were in fundamental agreement with the Secretary on the objectives of a
                        reduced U.S. share. They felt the infrastructure program must be continued.
                        The problem of an Interim Slice XVI had arisen after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, on President Kennedy's
                        instructions, had informed Congress in June 1963 that we would renegotiate a
                        new cost share this year, seeking a substantial reduction.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, Mr. Conroy pointed out that infrastructure has become the
                        largest single item in the Military Assistance Program in Europe and the
                        Congressional Committees therefore give it undue attention as another
                        handout of grant aid, which it is not. The Secretary asked what progress had
                        been made in removing the infrastructure item from <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and transferring it to the defense budget. He was informed
                        that Congress had been approached about this change. The Department
                        understands, also, that for internal administrative reasons, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> did not have sufficient time to make the
                        change this year. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> hoped
                        the change could be made.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that Interim Slice XVI is really a holding action which
                        was designed to fill the gap until the NATO Force Planning Exercise and the
                        general debate on strategy could be concluded. The NATO Military Authorities
                        would then have a basis for formulating the next longer term infrastructure
                        program and cost ceiling against which a new cost sharing formula could be
                        negotiated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> questioned
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName>'s ability to come up with
                        an agreed strategy upon which to develop new military requirements. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PDH1">Popper</persName> observed that there has
                        been some progress in the NATO Force Planning Exercise.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> again alluded to the
                        unfavorable situation which the United States faces and stated that the U.S.
                        still bears a disproportionate share of the defense burden. He said he was
                        in sympathy with the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        position expressed in the Sec Def letter. Mr. Weiss pointed out that, while
                        as a matter of principle we should work for an immediate reduction, the
                        amount saved for the U.S. in connection with Slice XVI, would be relatively
                        small as compared to the next four-year program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said that the amount appeared to be
                        no more than $5 to 7 million. The Secretary said he agreed that we should
                        make a reduction in the next four-year tranche our primary objective and
                        work towards that end. In order to facilitate that effort, and recognizing
                        the greater financial implications of the four-year program, we should put
                        the heaviest emphasis on this objective rather than on Slice XVI. He
                        accepted the suggestion that bilateral conversations should be started now
                        to lay the ground work for obtaining the longer term reduction. He concluded
                        by asking that the proposed letter be redrafted, making his position more
                        responsive to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on this
                        problem.</p>

                            telegram 1989, April 25, reported that information from several sources
                            revealed that France would soon demand that its remaining naval forces
                            no longer be under the command of NATO flag officers. The U.S. Missions
                            were requested to sound out the other NATO members discreetly to find
                            out their reaction. (Ibid.)</note> Following summary and tentative
                        analysis sent for your information. Your comment requested.</p>
                    <p>1. As addressees presumably now aware, latest change in French naval
                        relationships with NATO became effective through announcement by Admiral
                        Douguet, French MilRep to NATO Standing Group April 27, and through official
                        French press confirmation following day. As result, it appears that French
                        naval officers may no longer serve on NATO naval headquarters staffs or in
                        units under non-French naval command. (As far as we are aware, French
                        officers are still serving at <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss>.)
                        At same time, French announcements and Foreign Office (Paris 5108)<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">Dated April 28. (Ibid.)</note> indicate French
                        willing make some type of arrangements (but not formal or general agreement)
                        for naval cooperation between French naval units under purely French command
                        and NATO-committed naval units of other countries, to be applied in time of
                        war. Though not specifically stated, it would also appear French intend to
                        continue to make bilateral arrangements for cooperation in peacetime
                        maneuvers between US Sixth Fleet in Mediterranean and French Mediterranean
                        squadron, and may soon complete arrangements with <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> for similar bilateral cooperation
                        in naval exercises in ACLANT area.</p>
                    <p>2. Since French Mediterranean units were removed from NATO commitment in 1959
                        and all Atlantic units except five submarines were similarly removed
                        effective January 1, 1964, there is certain logic in April 27 moves. These
                        could be construed as tidying-up of anomalous situation in which French
                        officers but not French ships had been serving in the international chain of
                        command. In addition French have referred to heavy requirement for personnel
                        and materiel for support of nuclear tests in Pacific. It may as <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> indicates now be possible to work
                        out through French naval liaison officers some procedures through which
                        French vessels would operate in joint maneuvers and French officers would
                        plan for French naval measures in event of war, in such a <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0079"/>manner that end result would not be greatly
                        different from what it was when French fleet was earmarked for assignment to
                        NATO in war.</p>
                    <p>3. In strictly operational terms, therefore, new status may prove tolerable
                        from purely military standpoint, though it is too early to be certain.</p>
                    <p>4. Broader implications of French move are, however, profoundly disturbing,
                        because they strike at heart of NATO defense system. That system was built
                        up over time on assumption that Alliance could either deter or effectively
                        withstand weight of Soviet military power only if advance arrangements were
                        made and commitments undertaken to ensure that NATO forces would act under
                        integrated command and in coordinated fashion if the Alliance were compelled
                        to fight. Present system of NATO commands and planning units, NATO-committed
                        forces, commonly financed NATO infrastructure, NATO standard equipment
                        arrangements, NATO production and logistics arrangements, etc., while not
                        without shortcomings, represent fruit of years of painstaking effort to
                        build effective NATO military machine without destroying integrity of
                        national forces. Overall result has been to move considerable distance
                        toward “strength through unity” concept, and long-term trend has hitherto
                        been in direction of slow increase in general coordination.</p>
                    <p>5. French press comment and French National Assembly Foreign Affairs debate
                        April 28 and 29 make it very clear that French Government is in principle
                        opposed to this philosophy and to the established NATO military system. This
                        is because it inevitably results in some limitations on the unfettered
                        national freedom of action which during the April 28 debate <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murvillle</persName> so emphatically claimed
                        France now possesses. Qualified French sources are quoted in press to effect
                        that scrapping of NATO integrated command system is an element in the so far
                        unenunciated French plans for NATO reform. This is plausible deduction from
                        events and statements quoted above.</p>
                    <p>6. Carried to the extreme, French military disengagement from NATO—while
                        maintaining national Alliance ties French insist are a necessity—could limit
                        Alliance military arrangements purely to a system of agreements between
                        national military staffs for the “coordinated” use of national armed forces
                        under separate national commands in event of aggression calling Alliance
                        obligations into play. This in itself would not preclude some advance over
                        usual arrangements under traditional military alliances. On other hand,
                        result could differ little if at all from situation preceding first and
                        second world wars. It would require major modification in the present system
                        of force commitments to NATO which goes long way toward allowing NATO
                        commanders to make war plans with assurance that forces meeting determined
                        standards will be immediately available to seek predetermined military
                        objectives. It would certainly result in elimination, or transformation to
                        planning and <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0080"/>cadre status, of present
                        NATO headquarters and international commands. Depending on extent to which
                        carried, it could greatly diminish the expectation we have today that in
                        event of aggression NATO forces would move into action as provided under
                        existing NATO commitments, under NATO plans and NATO commanders. The
                        consequence could then be a less well coordinated and weaker defense, and a
                        major loss in trust and assurance within the Alliance. It is, of course,
                        possible that whatever the French intentions another effect of French
                        actions could be to stimulate a fundamental re-examination of NATO structure
                        and procedures, which could in the end have beneficial results.</p>
                    <p>7. In any case we could not expect the French to take drastic action in
                        immediate future. In their cat-and-mouse game with NATO, French have so far
                        been extremely careful to proceed in small steps, no single one of which
                        would provide a crisis. We assume that, lethargic though it is, French
                        public opinion would be deeply disturbed by overt French government action
                        clearly directed toward destroying NATO. Withdrawal from NATO commitment of
                        French ground or air forces, or withdrawal of French personnel from <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and subordinate <gloss target="#t_ACE1">ACE</gloss> headquarters, would involve major readjustments and would
                        have serious consequences for French defense system. Same would be true if
                        French withdrew from NATO air defense system. Shock to Franco-German
                        relations would be profound if present French contribution in Central Europe
                        area (deficient though it is) were substantially reduced. French experience
                        in nuclear war tactics would be halted if French nuclear-equipped air units
                        presently teamed up with NATO stockpile weapons in Germany were removed from
                        committed force category. French would suffer appreciable losses if their
                        officers could not participate in NATO planning and in host of NATO
                        infrastructure, logistics, and research and development activities from
                        which they are always most alert to draw advantage. Finally, French voice in
                        NATO military affairs would be muted if French MilRep were to be withdrawn
                        from NATO Military Committee and Standing Group.</p>
                    <p>8. So far we have seen no sign that any other allies intend to emulate the
                        French. It remains possible, however, that over the longer term others might
                        be inclined to follow the French example. State and Defense are studying
                        problem in depth and assessing its implications for Atlantic
                        interdependence, in effort to ascertain what if any adjustments of benefit
                        to US and Alliance can be worked out.</p>

                        necessarily general, but I believe useful in giving key European Community
                        officials appreciation of underlying US policies.</p>
                    <p>Talk opened with frank discussion of psychological climate in US-European
                        relations today. <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> said that
                        Europe wishes make reality of Atlantic partnership, which is announced goal
                        of US policy. <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> said Europe's
                        fundamental objective is to attain unity and hence equality with US. Europe
                        also wishes gain self-respect by playing major role in world along side US.
                        I replied by saying that US today has necessarily taken on heavy burden of
                        responsibilities around world. I explained that we do this out of harsh
                        self-interest, not philanthropy; that we care nothing for prestige involved;
                        and that we are more than happy to share these responsibilities. I explained
                        further that we are prepared go very far in pragmatic working together on
                        specific common tasks. Overt merging of sovereignty poses problems for us,
                        but American people prepared go very far indeed in working together with
                        other nations when they are convinced combined approach is only practical
                        means.</p>
                    <p>On Kennedy Round, I stressed necessity of success as one of most important
                        specific areas where combined action desirable which can be of benefit to
                        both partners in Atlantic area and to free world as a whole. <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>, choosing his words carefully,
                        said that one should not be pessimistic as regards solutions for technical
                        issues in KR.</p>
                    <p>On agriculture, both <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> made appeal for patience in
                        our negotiations, stressing great difficulty Community faces in trying to
                        negotiate with third countries while at same time unifying its internal
                        agricultural policies. I stressed importance of expanding trade to US in <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0082"/>context our world-wide foreign aid
                        and military responsibilities, mentioning particularly importance of
                        agriculture. I cited as great dilemma of our times that we are faced on one
                        hand with agricultural surpluses in more developed parts of world and with
                        population explosion in <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s.</p>
                    <p>Problem of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> raised frankly by
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, who stressed that he felt it
                        wrong that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> problem should
                        be portrayed as one between US and France when in reality it should be
                        quarrel between <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and rest of
                        Europe. I replied that there was one common thread which ran through all our
                        difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. This was
                        his insistence that we accept him and France as the spokesman for Europe
                        without assent of rest of Europe. This claim we cannot accept. I expressed
                        full understanding of how an individual Frenchman could, given the history
                        of France over the last 25 years, be strongly sympathetic to what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had done to restore stability and
                        self-respect, but I expressed deep regret that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s energies have been directed toward building up
                        narrow national prestige of France. Story would have been entirely different
                        if France had thrown same energy into building a really united Europe and an
                        effective partnership. If this had been done, France's and Europe's prestige
                        today would indeed be enormous. Instead, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> seems to be intent on building up France's national
                        prestige at the expense of France's friends. (These comments seemed to
                        elicit a very sympathetic response from the Commissioners.)</p>
                    <p>Nuclear question was raised by <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> who pointed out that some—not all—Europeans wanted
                        a larger nuclear role. I replied by emphasizing very heavily complete
                        indivisibility of nuclear defense in an alliance. I pointed out further that
                        US, in field of nuclear defense, has two great areas of responsibility.
                        Aside from Atlantic area, we are facing in Pacific very grave
                        responsibilities, and are facing them alone. We cannot, in light of this,
                        pool our global nuclear responsibility. Nevertheless, at the Atlantic area
                        we have gone very far indeed. I noted in general terms enormous power of
                        nuclear forces located in Europe, use of which is subject to joint decision
                        with our allies. This, I said, should be proof enough of how far we are
                        willing to go in sharing our responsibilities with our allies in the
                        Atlantic area. Our great nuclear strength, rather than giving us national
                        independence, makes us highly interdependent with our allies.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said he could not
                        over-state the importance of the Atlantic Alliance in Italian policy. NATO
                        was more important and necessary than ever. In fact, NATO was more important
                        to Italy than the Common Market. Without the latter Italy could pull
                        through; without NATO it was doubtful that Italy could survive. The
                        Secretary expressed a hope for success in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName>'s policy of drawing other coalition members into
                        support of this policy. He noted that in some cases this would be as
                        difficult as docking an ocean liner without tugs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he expected to comment on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> under Item II of the Agenda. His silence on this subject in
                        his initial statement should not be construed as U.S. lack of interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Agenda Item II was the Secretary General's Annual

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that a principal
                        danger on the horizon—which he did not, on the other hand, wish to
                        over-emphasize—was the policy of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> on the question of NATO and the Atlantic Alliance. He
                        said he had had very frank talks with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. Italy is convinced that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will not push so far as to break up NATO,
                        particularly since <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0084"/>this would cause a
                        serious rupture with the Germans. This factor sets a fundamental limit on
                        how far <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> can go, but within
                        these limits we can expect many more headaches from the French. He had told
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that if Moro and the
                        Italian Government were to follow the same policy as he, we would “in six
                        months have handed Italy over to the Communists.” He had the feeling that
                        this was the only thing which he had said which really impressed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, who was, he believed, playing
                        the game of the French Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said our basic view was that we must find a way to go on with
                        the necessary business of NATO and the Atlantic Alliance, without rancor and
                        without engendering unnecessary passionate argument. He was clear that there
                        was only one issue at the bottom of our troubles with France, namely,
                        Eisenhower's and Kennedy's refusal, in 1958 and 1961, to accept <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s proposal for a “Directoire,”
                        which meant in essence giving France the ability to speak for Europe without
                        the consent of the others. We should demonstrate patience without being
                        diverted from pursuing policies which were good for the Alliance. We can
                        only hope that, sometime, the situation will improve.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> repeated that he was
                        convinced <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would not break
                        up the Alliance. He was, however, somewhat concerned about when Labor in the
                        UK would turn to a more realistic policy on Europe. He was hopeful about
                        this, although he felt that now Labor was “50 years behind the times” in its
                        attempt to develop an “extra-Continental” alliance before getting into
                        Europe. However, this policy is likely to lose us two years, although we can
                        hope that the evolution in Labor's views will take place in parallel with
                        the evolution in French policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to say a word about the US–UK special
                        relationship, which was often more talked about than existing in fact. We
                        assume that to the extent there is a special relationship it will extend to
                        Europe when Britain moves into Europe. We do not want this to be a barrier
                        to the U.K. entering Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that a principal problem was convincing Labor
                        that they would not be abandoning this relationship with the US if they
                        shifted their European policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we must always be aware of the tremendous influence
                        and responsibility which could be exercised by an enlarged Europe (with all
                        of the individual connections with other parts of the globe which the
                        British, the French and the Italians have and which they would bring with
                        them into a united Europe), working in partnership with North America. This
                        would constitute a historic development of the center of the free world. The
                        tragedy of the present moment is that this movement has been set back at a
                        time that the Communist world is in disarray. We are foregoing great
                        possibilities and prospects by this fact.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. U.S. Policy on Spain and the Common Market</p>
                    <p>If Spain determines to renew its “candidacy for Europe” and is not quickly
                        rebuffed by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, it is likely that the
                        United States will be under continuing Spanish pressure to support the
                        Spanish application, and that the Spanish Government will act in the
                        knowledge of the important U.S. military and space interests in Spain. While
                        of course showing interest in Spain's economic problems, U.S. officials
                        should nevertheless remain entirely noncommittal on relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and should particularly avoid any
                        suggestion that the United States might be able to intervene on Spain's
                        behalf with the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>It is highly doubtful that United States support of Spain would be helpful in
                        overcoming the forces in Europe which still appear to be strong enough to
                        prevent Spanish association. Moreover, Spanish and possible German
                        initiatives to revive the question are not timely since they will
                        undoubtedly complicate the existing problems of European integration, thus
                        coming into conflict with our over-all policy objectives in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Any association between the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and Spain
                        that might emerge under present circumstances is most likely to be a
                            non-<gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> commercial arrangement. Such a
                        relationship would be contrary to our trade policy and inimical to the
                        commercial interests of the United States and other third countries.</p>
                    <p>An agreement involving preferences in favor of Spanish products over
                        competing Mediterranean products, e.g. citrus fruits, would be economically
                            <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0086"/>damaging to other Mediterranean
                        countries and would intensify pressure for similar associations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. We also have in mind that other
                        third countries have tried to induce the United States to intervene on their
                        behalf for preferential trade arrangements. We have consistently refused to
                        accede to these requests. In fact, we have energetically opposed Nigerian
                        association and continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Current U.S. policy on Spain is that “in the long term the U.S. looks to the
                        development of a stable and popularly-backed system of government in
                        post-Franco Spain and its full integration into the broad European and
                        Western Community—politically, economically, and militarily.”</p>
                    <p>Circular Telegrams 1906 of April 10, 1964 and 1975 of April 23, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">Neither printed. (Ibid., ECIN 6 <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>-SP)</note> provided guidance for
                        commenting on Spanish relations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Briefly, these messages defined our position as follows: (a)
                        We find it difficult to endorse arrangements involving discrimination
                        against the U.S. and other third countries by a broadening of the Common
                        Market preferential area. (b) The continued development of the Spanish
                        economy is of great interest to us, but the Kennedy Round offers the best
                        opportunity for Spain and other countries to reduce the adverse trade
                        effects of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. (c) We support increased
                        Spanish participation in European and other multilateral organizations such
                        as the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> where Spain is already able to
                        play an active role.</p>
                    <p>This policy remains unaltered. However, in view of the nature of the Under
                        Secretary's response to the Spanish Ambassador in connection with Spanish
                        ties with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, U.S. officials should, as
                        noted previously, observe a noncommittal position and for the present not

                        progress in KR possible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> stated he had underestimated
                        feelings and pressure of German farmers' organizations on grains question.
                        He suggested that solution might be to agree now that price level will be
                        set and unification take place in 1968. He said that if unified price
                        established now with implementation delayed until 1966, it may prove
                        unacceptable to others among Six at time of implementation especially in
                        light inflation.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor brought up question of access assurances, saying he was quite sure
                        price alone is insufficient as regulator of imports. Access assurances, he
                        noted, are contrary to Commission's philosophy. He suggested solution along
                        lines of a “mixed formula” where trade flow depends not only on price but
                        also on some other commitment. Commission, <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0088"/>he added, seems to be making some move that direction.
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would continue to press for import
                        guarantee.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> expressed full agreement on
                        need for access assurances, since unified prices would not possibly be low
                        enough to ensure access. Also explained pragmatic approach we suggest for
                        agricultural negotiations. Then restated dilemma presented by EEC's link of
                        decision on grains price to agricultural negotiations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that he couldn't make
                        binding response to this question now. We would discuss problem with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> and with DeGaulle in
                        their meeting July 3–4. Though he recognized present stalemate, he at no
                        point indicated grains price decision could be made this year. While stating
                        that KR will not fail because of German position on grains price, he
                        rejected thesis that grains price only stumbling block. His parting words
                        were: “No one is as firmly interested as Germany in success of KR. One
                        cannot advocate something with fervor on one hand and then say no when the
                        decisive question is put.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> remained for further lengthy
                        discussion after Chancellor had left. Said frankly that government doubts it
                        could get Bundestag majority for grains price unification now. Though this
                        not absolutely necessary, he added that in election period it would be very
                        difficult to take decision opposed both by Free Democrats and substantial
                        group within <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. Herter reiterated need to
                        work out negotiating rules on agriculture before November, and <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> agreed that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would help.</p>
                    <p>Returning to earlier discussion of access assurances, <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> thought Commission has “certain
                        flexibility” in its agricultural mandate enabling move on access. Presently
                        it is not disposed to use this flexibility, but <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would exert pressure to change this attitude.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Discussion leaves us with no illusions that
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> can be persuaded to agree to unified
                        grains price levels this year, even under <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> or U.S. pressure, which was never solicited. Present
                        impasse will continue unless stalemate broken in one way or other. However,
                        we will know more about possibility stalemate being broken after <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> and DeGaulle visits to Bonn.

                        opponents of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will be strengthened to
                        extent they able misrepresent US attitude as one of inflexibility and
                        unrelenting pressure upon allies to meet fixed timetable regardless
                        political circumstances in states concerned and regardless whether
                        governments stand or fall. Request your views on use of following line of
                        reasoning with Italy and UK on this matter.</p>
                    <p> US proposed timetable calls for preparations to proceed at such pace as to
                        be ready for decision and signature by November–December. Since these
                        preparations would be undertaken without commitment, we do not see why this
                        schedule should pose insuperable problems for any of governments concerned,
                        and the earlier such preparations completed the easier it will be for
                        post-election UK government and other governments to consider problem in all
                        its dimensions and better position all will be to make decision on signing
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>As to signing date, we continue hope and expect that sufficient number of
                        governments to permit establishment of Force may be prepared sign agreement
                        at end current year. But this is, of course, decision for them to make in
                        light of their individual circumstances; while explaining the basis for our
                        own views and actions, we do not intend to apply pressure on them with
                        respect to either substance or timing. As we have often said, no individual
                        country (e.g. Italy or UK) is in our view essential to that end; an
                        additional element whose implications we will have to consider is growing
                        favorable trend in Low countries.</p>
                    <p>Inability of country to sign at end of year would not of course necessarily
                        deprive it of opportunity to be founding member, since several months would
                        be required for legislative action and deposit of ratification before treaty
                        could come into effect. Arrangements could be made for signing by UK or
                        Italy during this period. Indeed, some Labor <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0090"/>spokesmen have indicated that it would be easier for a
                        Labor government to sign if others had already done so, so that UK did not
                        seem to be taking initiative. Even at that stage there would be room for at
                        least some flexibility on date of deposit of required ratification if
                        desirable to achieve broader base for initial components of Force.</p>
                    <p>Nor do we exclude Charter in sufficiently flexible terms that weapon system
                        add-ons of kind in which UK interested might be provided for in principle in
                        advance of full elaboration of details.</p>
                    <p>Thus US considers schedule as envisaged already contains the essential
                        elements of flexibility required to meet principal UK and Italian
                        concerns.</p>

                    <p>1. The President asks you to call on Chancellor promptly to express
                        President's deep appreciation for highly confidential message conveyed in
                        your 47<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">In telegram 47 from Bonn, July 6,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> transmitted a
                            detailed report given to him by <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> of the Chancellor's July 3–4 meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> characterized the talks as
                            “tough,” and related that he had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> he could not agree with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s concept of Europe,
                            stressing that Germany's relationship with the United States was the
                            decisive point. The Chancellor told <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> that the results of the meeting were meager and
                            asked whether the United States had any plan for improving its relations
                            with France. (Ibid.)</note> and to convey following message in
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>2. President is most grateful for the Chancellor's confidence and will insure
                        that there is no disclosure of the contents of his message, or indeed of its
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>3. On substance, the President finds himself in full agreement with views
                        expressed by Chancellor, and in particular re-emphasizes his conviction that
                        it can never be useful for Germany to be forced to a choice <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0091"/>between France and the United States. We are
                        all members of the same alliance. The US continues to believe that
                        interdependence of Europe and America is inescapable reality upon which
                        policy of all must be based. President believes that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s proposals to the Chancellor fly
                        in the face of this reality, and that it is of highest importance that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> should learn to
                        recognize the firmness and rightness of the position the Chancellor put
                        forward. Thus although President regrets any argument among allies, he
                        cannot but send his thanks to Chancellor for the position he stoutly and
                        clearly set forth to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. You can reassure Chancellor once more that US would welcome an improvement
                        of relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and will
                        always be ready for serious discussion with France. Moreover, US will not
                        squabble publicly with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. At
                        the same time Chancellor can be quite sure, as you have already said, that
                        the US will never make any private agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or anyone else at expense of
                        Germans. Nor can US regard the General as spokesman for Europe.</p>
                    <p>5. President hopes that as time passes it may be possible to make new
                        beginnings toward stronger partnership, always with room for France and
                        never with any thought of exclusiveness. This is immediate value of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and the President repeats his belief that
                        it will be important to move ahead promptly with this major undertaking in
                        the last months of 1964.</p>
                    <p>6. If there should be any fresh prospect of wider agreement among Germany,
                        France, US, UK and Italy, President would gladly lead new and strong effort
                        by all to move forward. Please note inclusion of Italy, whose solidarity in
                        Alliance needs constant attention.</p>
                    <p>7. The President values your prompt and comprehensive report of Chancellor's
                        extraordinarily revealing conversation and sends thanks.</p>

                    <p>139. Pass White House. I called on the Chancellor June 13 at my request. I
                        first went over again with him the message from the President contained in

                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> reported on his meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> on July 10 in
                            telegram 120 from Bonn, July 11. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            POL 3 <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> W)</note> I complimented the
                        Chancellor on his courageous speech in Munich (in which the Chancellor had
                        made a reference to the communication received from the President) and on
                        the favorable comments on the speech in the German press. The Chancellor
                        seemed particularly interested in the foreign press reaction, and inquired
                        what the American reaction had been. I told him that the news stories had
                        been favorable and offered to send him a summary of editorial comment.</p>
                    <p>I referred to the Chancellor's proposal made in his speech for a NATO summit
                        meeting to be held after the American and British elections, and asked how
                        this proposal related to the President's suggestion that he, the President,
                        might be willing to take an initiative leading to wider agreement between
                        Germany, France, the U.S., the U.K. and Italy. The Chancellor replied that
                        he considered such an initiative could be quite helpful. Before Europe can
                        discuss political union, it must reach a common policy on defense, which
                        means that they must agree on the future organization of NATO. The Germans
                        would welcome a discussion of NATO with a group including France. France
                        would in such a group be isolated in its purely national concept of the NATO
                        military organization. All the others, including Germany, would strongly
                        favor integrated forces. He asked whether or not the President had in mind a
                        meeting of the Five to discuss NATO in general from above, or whether they
                        would meet within the framework of NATO. He would prefer the former. I said
                        that although it was not explicit in the President's communication, I assume
                        that this is what he meant.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor would also welcome the proposed forum to discuss the whole
                        range of problems existing between France and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He seemed to think that the first step towards any
                        initiative by the President should be a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, perhaps to be followed by a
                        summit meeting of the Five. Even if this could not be held until after the
                        elections, both he and <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>
                        pointed out that it would be well if preparatory work were begun now.</p>
                    <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor then clarified what he considered he had undertaken to report
                        to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in their meeting
                        held July 3–4. It was not incumbent upon Germany to make specific proposals
                        for European political union. Indeed, there was no proposition acceptable to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> which could meet the
                        vital interests of Germany. He had in his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed to propose only methods,
                        or techniques, within the treaty—not plans as to the expansion of the treaty
                        as such. (His aide explained to me later that what he had in mind might, for
                        example, be to recommend a French-German committee to be set up within the
                        treaty to consider this question further, or that representatives of
                        specified nations might be called upon to consider the matter further.) It
                        is quite clear, however, that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        has no present intention of making any new substantive proposal for European
                        political union.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor seemed quite eager to find out the results of my luncheon
                        discussion (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 136)<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">Dated July 13. (Ibid., POL 12 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> with former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. When I asked him whether he
                        thought he and <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> should work
                        together, within the party, the steps that they should take in the future
                        leading toward European political unity, he indicated that he was
                        “skeptical.” (<persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, as reported
                            <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 136, is not unhappy at the
                        moment because he feels that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        has no real views and he is confident he can bring him around to his own,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s, views. In a sense,
                        this is right. Although <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> knows
                        what he does not want, he does not appear to know just what he does
                        want.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, on the other hand, is deeply
                        suspicious that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s
                        protestations of wanting to put out invitations to a large group (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>) to join a political union (which
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, who has gone so far as
                        to spell out machinery for such a move, also espouses) represent a tactic,
                        whereas his real intention is to force a permanent union between Germany and
                        France. This, in the Chancellor's view could only result in German
                        domination by France. Since no proposal, acceptable by France, was likely to
                        be acceptable by others, Adenauer would, after the others had declined, have
                        a good moral case for proceeding with German-French union.</p>
                    <p>In order to assure that France and Germany would have some company (apart
                        from Luxembourg, which is the only other country of the Six everyone agrees
                        would join), <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has been
                        proposing the inclusion of Portugal and Spain. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> says that he chided <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> as to the appearance which would result if France
                        and Germany ended up in the same grouping with the only two dictators left
                        in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that the people
                        at the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> convention in Munich were so
                        confused that they were proposing that Czechoslovakia and Poland be included
                        in the <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0094"/>invitations for political
                        union. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> himself, however,
                        reverted to the suggestion made in our meeting of July 6<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">See <ref target="#d28fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            28</ref>.</note> that invitations to join a political union need not
                        necessarily be limited to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        countries—specifically mentioning the UK and Scandinavian countries as being
                        possible candidates.</p>
                    <p>Comment: I believe that the Chancellor sees real possibilities in the
                        suggestion contained in <gloss target="#t_Nodis1">Nodis</gloss> 67 that the
                        President take some initiative in bringing together the five countries. The
                        Dept may wish to give additional thought to how this concept can be further
                        developed. We will forward our own suggestions. It is interesting that the
                        principal interest of the Chancellor in such an initiative appears to derive
                        from its possible usefulness in helping him resolve the dilemma arising out
                        of his confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        within the narrower framework of the French-German treaty.</p>
                    <p>Comments on the Chancellor's observation on political union will be embodied
                        in our overall summary. It is quite clear, however, that he has no intention
                        of making substantive proposals for unity at this time. He is concerned
                        about the future tactics of Adenauer whom, despite what he (<persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>) says, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> sees interested only in driving on toward
                        French-German union.<note n="6" xml:id="d29fn6">

                    <p>Unnumbered. With recent crescendo of Soviet attacks on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, I have given considerable thought to
                        long-range implications of current Soviet posture, particularly with regard
                        to likely Soviet attitude toward non-dissemination agreement in various
                        predictable situations. Moscow <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0095"/>must
                        itself be undergoing some soul-searching on this question with eye
                        particularly on China. I assume Department is also taking hard look at
                        policy prospects, not only with regard to Soviet and Chicom attitudes but
                        also <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> posture in event <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> failure. Following thoughts may be useful
                        to Department in its own contingency planning:</p>
                    <p>1. As suggested Embassy telegram 104,<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">Dated July
                            11. (Ibid.)</note> the Soviets can be expected to be actively hostile to

                        particularly if they suspect it may fail. Current tactic, as reflected by
                        differential emphasis in July 11 notes,<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">For text

                        off support for the project with the aim of reducing its participants to
                        point where project likely to abort.</p>
                    <p>2. In opposing <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, Moscow is reacting in
                        familiar Pavlovian fashion to Western defense measure. I believe, however,
                        that Soviets are also probably genuinely concerned that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will only hasten the day when <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> becomes a nuclear power. While July 25 TASS
                        statement on US–NATO nuclear agreement represents familiar effort to tar US
                        as insincere in support non-dissemination, it also probably reflects
                        tendency read agreement as merely one of successive steps making <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “finger on nuclear trigger” eventually
                        inevitable. Embassy notes with interest Tsarapkin's veiled warning on this
                        question (Geneva telegram 1982).<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">A mistaken

                        <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would obviously give rise to problems of
                        military nature for Soviet strategic planners, but I am inclined to think
                        Soviets are even more concerned with political implications. Specifically,
                        they probably fear effect of possession of nuclear weapons on West German
                        political stance, particularly toward Central Europe. They may also feel
                        that they will be called upon to share their nuclear monopoly in some
                        fashion with their allies—if only to give positive content to their warnings
                        of need for appropriate counter-measures and to prove they have equal
                        confidence in their own allies.</p>
                    <p>3. Given popular appeal of non-dissemination agreement, and concern over
                        possible West German acquisition of nuclear weapons, it is natural that
                        Moscow should imply strongly that creation of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will end Soviet willingness sign non-dissemination
                        agreement. Propaganda leverage aside, however, Soviets must ask themselves
                        seriously whether non-dissemination agreement would continue to be in their
                        interest (a) if <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> becomes reality; (b) if
                        it fails and pressure for an independent European or Franco-German nuclear
                        deterrent grows; and (c) after China explodes its first device. Central
                        question for Soviets (as well as for US) is <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0096"/>at what point does the expansion of the nuclear club
                        undercut the whole rationale for non-dissemination agreement and even
                        require that Moscow leave itself the option of supplying, or threatening to
                        supply its allies and friends with nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>4. It seems to me that Moscow has even more reason to fear an arms race
                        involving nuclear weapons than the West, and accordingly will continue to
                        have more compelling reasons to press for a non-dissemination agreement.
                        There are many more states in non-Communist world with capacity to build and
                        maintain nuclear weapons than in the Bloc. Also, we obviously have less
                        qualms about acquisition of nuclear weapons by our allies than Moscow has
                        about weapons in the hands of an anti-Soviet Polish or Rumanian Government,
                        or nervous, belligerent Pankow. Should nuclear arms race escalate and fear
                        spread, Soviets might in addition be subjected to pressure for aid or at
                        least extension of nuclear shield to such self-assertive, anti-Western
                        states as Indonesia and UAR. Moscow would have serious reservations about
                        acceding to such requests with the attendant risks that such “friends” would
                        follow policies inviting Soviet involvement in nuclear holocaust. Moscow
                        might decide, therefore, to opt for non-dissemination policy, even with
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, in order to avoid or postpone
                        moment of dangerous escalation in nuclear arms race and anguished decisions
                        which it would pose. Such a decision would be the more likely if <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were accompanied by guarantees against
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> national production, possession or
                        control nuclear arms (see paragraph 7 below).</p>
                    <p>5. Possibility that Communist China will explode nuclear device in the
                        relatively near future provides more immediate and compelling reason for
                        Moscow's pressing non-dissemination agreement. Soviets can have no
                        expectation that Chinese would enter an agreement which would require them
                        to forego nuclear capability. Non-dissemination agreement which secured the
                        almost universal support of nuclear have-nots would serve, however, like
                            <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> agreement, to dramatize which states
                        “are for peace and which for war.” Soviets will expect Chinese to exploit
                        acquisition of nuclear weapons to enhance their power and prestige in Asia.
                        (“See what backward Asian people can achieve in face opposition of both
                        imperialists and revisionists.”) Implicit in Chinese criticism of Moscow's
                        efforts to share “nuclear monopoly” with “imperialists” is also suggestion
                        that Chinese would share nuclear secrets with their N. Korean, and even
                        Indonesian allies—posture which Peiping can easily assume when it lacks
                        bomb. In this phase of heightened rivalry, particularly in Asia, Moscow has
                        obvious interest in finding new cudgel with which to flog Peiping and an
                        issue which can become focus of organization drive by pro-Soviet elements
                        and criterion by which to separate friend from foe within communist
                        movement.</p>
                    <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/>
                    <p>6. Ban on nuclear weapons for nuclear have-nots is more complicated issue to
                        manipulate, however, than TB agreement. Soviets are obviously sensitive to
                        danger that they may themselves enhance impression and corresponding fear of
                        Chinese power by making too much of an issue over possession of nuclear
                        weapons. Hence steps taken, notably last autumn, to emphasize cost of
                        constructing meaningful arsenal, including means of delivery. Similar
                        concern may explain curious citation in June 15 note to CCP of US statements
                        that Chinese follow “moderate” policy in deeds in contrast to militant
                        words.</p>
                    <p>7. Moreover, non-dissemination agreement would be effective weapon to isolate
                        Chinese only if it is signed by overwhelming majority of states. To persuade
                        states with nuclear potential like <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                        Sweden, Israel to participate, agreement would presumably need to be phrased
                        in general language of desirability rather than absolute ban, and include
                        escape clause along lines existing proposals.</p>
                    <p>8. Soviets would certainly seek additional guarantees as condition their
                        abandonment of opposition to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in event
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should become or seems about to
                        become reality. As minimum they would require <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> adherence to non-dissemination agreement commitments not to
                        receive weapons. Might also demand broadening of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> commitments to
                        include USSR, possibly in form of agreement to which <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be set up as signatory. While such pledges could pose
                        problems vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, they not
                        necessarily undesirable from our point of view. (I would appreciate Bonn's
                        comments on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reaction to such gambits, as
                        well as generally on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> attitude toward
                        non-dissemination in event <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> failure.)</p>
                    <p>9. We obviously cannot be categoric in projecting Soviet behavior. It seems
                        to me, however, that Moscow must find itself at present pulled by opposing
                        policy considerations. On one hand, it seeks to use maximum propaganda
                        leverage against <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. At same time, it may
                        wish to move to get campaign against dissemination of nuclear weapons
                        underway before Chinese explode first device. Moscow cannot move on a
                        non-dissemination agreement until it chooses to overlook US policy of
                        promoting <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—for any effective worldwide
                        campaign must be founded on US-Soviet cooperation. One could argue that the
                        longer Moscow persists in its anti-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        campaign, the more serious we must take its claimed fear that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will open door to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> acquisition of nuclear weapons. Once anti-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> phase in Soviet policy is past—for one
                        reason or another—we may find ourselves forced to decide whether our own
                        long-term policy interests dictate that we should assist Moscow in its
                        anti-Chinese campaign by pressing non-dissemination agreement if only as
                        final, perhaps futile effort to avoid facing up to world in which nuclear
                        weapons have truly become conventional.</p>

                    <p>I have been following with interest the Paris discussions on future NATO
                        arrangements with an independent Malta and the exchanges on a possible NATO
                        tie and presence, and I venture this personal comment on a wholly informal
                            basis.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">The question of NATO's future
                            relationship with Malta had been under active discussion in July and
                            August. On July 31, <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> sent
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> a memorandum stating that
                            the United States agreed with the United Kingdom that after independence
                            it would be undesirable for the island to be either a member or an
                            associate member of NATO. (Ibid.) On August 11, a memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that Malta
                            continue to be in the area subject to defense by NATO without any formal
                            membership tie. (Ibid.) Discussions in the North Atlantic Council on
                            July 24 and August 13 highlighted these same differences among the
                            Alliance members, with most being dubious about a formal tie, but
                            wanting some link to safeguard Western security interests. (Topol 267 to
                            Paris, August 18; ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Given the Cyprus experience and the fact that elements in the Maltese
                        political picture could produce a Cyprus-like problem there, I think an
                        effective case can be made for a NATO tie and the establishment of a NATO
                        presence before the island is given its independence and before this matter
                        becomes enmeshed in internal Maltese politics.</p>
                    <p>Obviously there are some legal and political problems which must be ironed
                        out. On balance, however, I do think timing is important and that these
                        matters should, if possible, be resolved early enough so that on September
                        21, the NATO tie and the NATO presence are in place. If, subsequently,
                        difficulties do develop, NATO then will be in position to deal with them in
                        terms that make most sense to the West.</p>
                    <p>As our leading specialist on attractive Mediterranean islands you will, I
                        think, appreciate this point perhaps better than anyone else—so I send this

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Preliminary Remarks</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Platzer had asked for a briefing on the US position on an
                            Austrian-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> apologized for asking
                        the Ambassador to come in on a holiday. He explained that he himself would
                        be leaving for Europe on Wednesday, September 9.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he was grateful to have an opportunity to speak with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> because one of the
                        principal topics to be discussed at the Austrian Ambassadors Conference
                        scheduled for Vienna September 19–22 would be Austria's relationship with
                        the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> said that we had
                        followed Austria's approaches to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        through the years and particularly since the “expectant period” of 1961 and
                        early 1962. As we saw the situation, Austria's relationship with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> revolved around two problems: the question
                        of Austria's neutrality and the type of arrangement that might be
                        negotiated.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Neutrality</p>
                    <p>We looked upon Austria's neutrality as basically a matter of Austrian
                        responsibility. We were very respectful of how Austria had handled it,
                        particularly Austria's not having looked to other powers for an
                        interpretation or definition of its neutrality, but having relied upon
                        itself, as evidenced in its having joined the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and sought an arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. In short, we agreed that Austria had the freedom to
                        interpret and define its own neutrality.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Austrian-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        Relations</p>
                    <p>We had always looked upon the Austrian-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        problem as a unique one, and we had a sympathetic attitude toward Austria's
                        achieving a relationship with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        provided the relationship would not create a precedent and the arrangement
                        worked out would minimize discrimination <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0100"/>against third countries. We continued to hope that the
                        success of the Kennedy Round would go a long way toward eliminating
                        Austria's trade problems. We had also noted that Austria's trade experience
                        with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had not been as bad as was
                        thought in 1961–62 that it would be. We would therefore hope that in the
                        continuing negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> it
                        would be possible for Austria to take into account the possible benefits of
                        the Kennedy Round and that any arrangement worked out would not be
                        discriminatory. Against this background, we would hope for a successful
                        conclusion of the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador pointed out that Austria's talks with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> were approaching a new stage. Until now
                        only preliminary discussions had been held, but it was anticipated that a
                        new phase, namely, formal negotiations, would get under way sometime this
                        fall.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> said that he understood
                        that one of the problems that lies ahead related to Austria's own desires
                        with respect to an arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.
                        The Ambassador replied that it was very difficult to come to conclusions on
                        this score. Opinions in Austria were much divided. Differences existed not
                        only between the coalition partners but within each of the parties; many
                        Peoples Party adherents opposed an arrangement, and many Socialists favored
                        one, and vice versa. Moreover, the Ambassador had recently talked with
                        President Mayer-Gunthof of the League of Industrialists, who had told him
                        that there were wide differences of opinion even within that group. There
                        was also the problem of the USSR's attitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> said that one of the few
                        really predictable things was that anything that tended to strengthen
                        Western cohesion would be opposed by the USSR with various degrees of
                        intensity. In this connection he wished to say once again that we believed
                        it was the responsibility of Austria itself to decide how it wished to
                        interpret its neutrality and its attitude toward an <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arrangement. Otherwise, we saw no reason why Austria should
                        hold back in its efforts to arrive at an arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He did not think there was any change in
                        our basic attitude since we first started discussing this matter in 1962. We
                        had always taken into account the fundamental fact of life about Austria's
                        large trade with the Six, and we thought it almost inevitable that some kind
                        of special relationship would eventually be worked out. At the same time, we
                        were quite hopeful that, despite difficulties, there were real prospects
                        that the Kennedy Round, when the negotiations were completed next year or in
                        1966, would turn out to be the most successful negotiations we had ever
                        attempted. Remaining difficulties pertained primarily to agriculture. We
                        understood that Austria was more interested in industrial products. The
                        Ambassador remarked that this was “absolutely correct”. Austria exported
                        relatively few agricultural products to the Six, some cheese and cattle,
                        wine and timber, but these were “not absolutely basic”.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> asked the Ambassador's
                        prediction on what was likely to happen this fall. The Ambassador replied
                        that he thought the negotiations would get started and we “could only see
                        how things go”. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>'s question whether the preliminary talks had gone
                        a long way toward laying the groundwork for successful negotiations, the
                        Ambassador said that he would not say “toward successful negotiations,” but
                        at least Austria had been able to find out where it stood with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The problem was not so much an economic as
                        a political one, particularly as related to Austria's neutrality. It had
                        been much easier earlier when Switzerland was also seeking a relationship
                        with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He recalled that in the Moscow
                        Memorandum of April 1955<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">For text, see Department
                            of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 20, 1955, pp.
                            1011–1013.</note> mention was made of Switzerland as the model to be
                        followed by Austria with respect to neutrality. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> said that we would be interested
                        to see how the negotiations unfolded in the fall. He added that he would
                        like to exchange views again with the Ambassador upon their respective
                        returns from Europe. The Ambassador said that he would return to Washington
                        on September 24 and would be delighted to have another opportunity to speak
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Bill:</p>
                    <p>I have been thinking for some time over the Brosio report of his conversation
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on NATO, which you
                        undoubtedly have seen (Polto 366, September 5, 1964).<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">This telegram reported that in a 50-minute “relaxed,
                            courteous and calm discussion” on September 5 with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> had made the following points: NATO needed
                            sufficient forces to fight the Soviet Union in case it decided to attack
                            in Europe; France opposed NATO as an organization since its object was
                            integration of national efforts, which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> opposed; and NATO was no longer necessary because
                            the United States was not the only Western power with atomic capability.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> how the NATO treaty might be
                            revised, but the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Gaulle</persName> said such
                            suggestions would be useless since the United States would be
                            “diabolically opposed to his ideas,” and nothing would come of the
                            discussion. Although <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            did not mention it specifically, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> got the impression that France would denounce the
                            treaty in 1969. (Ibid., Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>)1)</note> While this report contains nothing of
                        startling newness it nevertheless seems to me somewhat more brutal and <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0102"/>specific than previous <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> statements on the subject of
                        NATO. Also, the fact that it was made to the Secretary General of NATO, with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s authority to pass it
                        on to NATO Delegations, seems to put these utterances into a somewhat
                        special category.</p>
                    <p>I would like to comment here, however, that I think that Brosio is wrong in
                        his impression that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                        seriously thinking of denouncing the NATO Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has always made a very definite
                        distinction between the treaty setting up the Alliance and the structure of
                        the organization. This, I think, emerges with sufficient clarity from his
                        talk with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>.</p>
                    <p>While I fully realize that there is undoubtedly no disposition in Washington
                        to take any action which might precipitate a row with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> at this time, especially before
                        elections, I really am beginning to wonder how long we should remain
                        quiescent in the face of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        gratuitous interpretation of American policy. You will notice in Paragraph 3
                        of the report in question he asserts that the U.S. is no longer interested
                        in Europe, having transferred its main preoccupation to the Pacific, and as
                        a consequence, as stated in the report, “U.S. would not come to assistance
                        Europe if attacked by Soviets”.</p>
                    <p>I don't know exactly what method we can use to convince <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or at least cause him to lay off
                        this type of criticism, that the U.S. does not have any intention of going
                        back on its pledged word in regard to the defense of Europe and/or the use
                        of nuclear weapons if it seemed necessary. However, I do think that sooner
                        or later our policy of rolling with the punch will begin to react against
                        us. It seems to me that having made these statements, which are directly
                        contrary not only to the announced intentions of the U.S. but also to its
                        solemn obligations under the NATO Treaty, to as important an international
                        official as <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> would give us a
                        certain basis for objecting. I imagine this will have to await the election,
                        but I would certainly think, if only for the record, that we should take up
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> our refutation of his
                        thesis in regard to the intentions of the U.S. vis-a-vis Europe.</p>
                    <p>I fully realize that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does
                        this in order to justify the enormous expenditures for France involved in
                        the creation of the force-de-frappe, but I am concerned that if he continues
                        to make these statements, and they are unrefuted by us, sooner or later
                        through the process of erosion we will come to have this view in part
                        accepted by a number of other countries in Europe. It would not be difficult
                        to write out an iron-clad refutation of this thesis, including the
                        stationing of troops in Europe, the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons on the
                        soil of Europe, provisions of the Treaty itself, as well as the fundamental
                        considerations which led the U.S. to sign the Treaty in the first place. It
                        is hardly likely for the U.S. to stand by and let Europe be overrun by the
                        Soviets in the belief that we would be permanently saving a number of
                        American cities.</p>

                        particularly in view of fact that NATO was “running out”. He felt that
                        future of NATO itself would be one best subject for discussion at such
                        meeting. Unless we reach agreement soon on this question, time will work in
                        favor of French and success of Kennedy Round and other overall Atlantic
                        objectives will be adversely affected. Such limited meeting should, however,
                        not actually be called on NATO basis since the NATO countries excluded would
                        be offended. The most logical ostensible basis for a meeting of the US, UK,
                        France and Germany would be as signatories of Bonn Convention, although
                        meeting could in fact be devoted to broader concepts of Western cooperation.
                        This did not mean that he was against inclusion of Italy, but that it would
                        be difficult to justify Italian participation while excluding others. He
                        considered that an initiative by President along these lines would be
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>In response to my query, which I put to him on a purely personal and
                        hypothetical basis, as to whether he would be willing sound out de Gaulle to
                        see if he would be agreeable to such meeting, and to President's taking the
                        appropriate initiative, he answered with alacrity that he would. As a matter
                        of fact, he had sounded out <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>, not specifically with respect to summit meeting of any
                        particular grouping of states, but more along lines of whether meeting
                        between himself and President might not result in better understanding
                        between the two. He thought it significant that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> did not say no, nor did he say that such a meeting
                        would be without value. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                        merely replied, “We will have to see.”</p>
                    <p>Chancellor continued that in his judgment many unresolved problems which had
                        arisen under the Franco-German treaty could be approached with more hope of
                        success after a US-French rapprochement. He speculated that President might
                        first meet with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> with
                        understanding that he (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>) would
                        join with them later. He did not explain, nor did I seek clarify, the
                        question whether there was any discrepancy between such an approach and a
                        four or five power meeting. Having received word in telephone conversation
                        with the Dept earlier in the day<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">No record of
                            this telephone conversation has been found.</note> that favorable
                        consideration was being given in Washington to my proposal contained in
                        Embtel 929 that the Chancellor be encouraged to make some approach to de
                        Gaulle, I asked Chancellor whether he had any objection to my sounding out
                        our govt on this question. He said he would welcome our reaction.</p>
                    <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"/>
                    <p>He then recalled that he had queried me immediately after the recent
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visit as to what U.S.
                        reaction would be in event <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                        following what he might have considered a rebuff, should turn to the U.S.

                                2, Document 28</ref>.</note> He remembered the assurances which he
                        had received at the time from President (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 67). He wanted make it clear, however, that he was “not
                        afraid” of a U.S.-French rapprochement. It is clear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wishes to establish closer
                        cooperation with Germany, but it also understood that Germany not willing
                        accept <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s concepts. Since
                        Germany and U.S. have similar concepts, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> cannot hope achieve full cooperation with Germany
                        without at the same time harmonizing his views with U.S.</p>
                    <p>In parting, Chancellor asked me extend his warm greetings to President
                        Johnson.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName>:</p>
                    <p>This is a Saturday morning letter stimulated in part by Bob Schaetzel's
                        account of his informal talk with you last Wednesday evening.<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> recorded that following a
                            dinner on September 16, he, <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PDH1">Popper</persName>, and other U.S. officials discussed future U.S.
                            policy in Europe. The Ambassador believed “that the present temper in
                            Washington is in favor of action for action's sake.” No other record of
                            this discussion has been found. (Ibid.)</note> As I understand it, you
                        expressed very strongly your views that we ought to take our foot off the
                        European accelerator pedal and, while making clear our position on the
                        principles governing effective Atlantic relations, leave it to the Europeans
                        to work out when and how they propose to organize themselves into an entity
                        which would constitute a basis for partnership.</p>
                    <p>During those four weeks away from the fuss and fever of Washington I had the
                        opportunity to think things over and assess in my own mind the validity and
                        the prospect of success of some of our policies. As a result, I am more than
                        ever convinced that we have made a very great mistake over the last three
                        years in trying to push Europe along one particular road, in spite of the
                        fact that the conditions for success in this venture were obviously not
                        present, and that by exerting such pressures we were tending to justify the
                        suspicion (exploited but not originated by DeGaulle) that what the United
                        States is really after is an Atlantic framework within which Europe will be
                        expected to play a predetermined part within predetermined limits only. I
                        want to make it clear to you that I believe strongly in the broad lines and
                        the goals of our European policy as defined in the key speeches by the
                        President and other high government spokesmen. Of these speeches, that by
                        President Kennedy on July 4, 1962,<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">For text of
                            this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
                                the United States: John F. Kennedy, 1962</hi>, pp. 537–539.</note>
                        is perhaps the most noteworthy. What I am objecting to and regretting is the
                        constant effort to give this policy a specific content in the immediate
                        future by nagging and worrying and lecturing all and sundry in Europe or
                        over here who we felt might be useful instruments for our purpose. Such an
                        attitude was bound to create resentment and to cast doubt on our motives.
                        Since our efforts were obviously destined not to achieve the desired result,
                        they also cast doubt on our wisdom and maturity and, by inference, tended to
                        justify DeGaulle's thesis that America's <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0107"/>interests in the organization of the West are not
                        necessarily the same as Europe's.</p>
                    <p>Even now the lesson has not been learned, and there is still a lot of
                        climbing up and down trees, and wheels spinning in a vacuum in the whole
                        area of Atlantic relations. It is very hard indeed for some people to accept
                        the fact that the best, indeed the only, policy which we should pursue in
                        order to contribute to the creation of an Atlantic relationship which will
                        serve our long-term national interests, is to leave it to the Europeans to
                        work out the mode and manner and timing of their own organization. If they
                        are convinced that the principles of our policy (interdependence and
                        partnership) are in their long-term interests, they will so comport
                        themselves as to create the conditions which such a mutual policy requires
                        for its success. If they are not convinced of this, harrying them, telling
                        them they ought to be, and excommunicating those who are not sufficiently
                        responsive in our view, is certainly not going to make them change their
                        minds. Moreover, the moralizing note of reprobation which is sounded from
                        this side of the Atlantic with regard to those attitudes in the field of
                        European unity which displease us is simply poison to our purpose and
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>I am not advocating a negative policy with regard to our European relations.
                        As you know, this is the area to which I am most attached and in which I
                        believe deeply. I do plead, however, for distinguishing between the
                        formulation of policies with goals and objectives which can be expected to
                        appeal to Europeans and thus stimulate them in their own way and in their
                        own time to advance in our direction, and the attempt to bring about and
                        accelerate this process by appearing to arrogate to ourselves the wisdom and
                        the right of definition as to how this should be achieved.</p>
                    <p>I think we will have a great chance after the election to recast the role of
                        the United States in European eyes and thus to liberate and encourage
                        renewed, and hopefully productive, efforts by Europeans to move in the
                        direction of greater political unity. However, for this to happen, there
                        will have to be basic agreement and understanding within the executive
                        branch of the government, not only in our goals, but on the nature of the
                        approach required to promote them. Equally important, and perhaps even more
                        difficult: there will have to be agreement and understanding on what
                        efforts, attitudes and tactics are not merely wasteful, but unhelpful. It
                        may well be that this will be the most difficult of all.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate it if you would keep the foregoing confidential. I am not
                        showing it to anyone in my office.</p>
                    <p> Betsy and I look forward very much to seeing you again in December, and send
                        you all much love.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Last April you transmitted to me through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName>, your Permanent Representative
                        with NATO, a message in which you expressed your firm intention to initiate
                        all necessary measures in the United States to make it possible to sign an
                        agreement on the Multilateral Nuclear Force before the end of this
                            year.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">See <ref target="#d17">Document

                            <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> that I fully concurred
                        in your views and intentions in this question. At our meeting in June we
                        confirmed this agreement and set it forth explicitly in our communique.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">See <ref target="#d26fn3">footnote 3, Document

                    </p>
                    <p>The heads of our Delegation in Paris have endeavored to further the
                        discussions in the working group of the eight interested states in order
                        that the treaty might be signed by our target date. Unfortunately, the
                        working group has not made such rapid progress as I had hoped. As matters
                        stand, there is little prospect that this group will be able by the end of
                        the year to work out a draft treaty to which all governments concerned could
                        quickly agree.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime our two Delegation Chairmen in Paris have worked out an
                        initial working draft for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Charter.
                        This draft no doubt needs revision, but in my opinion it should be submitted
                        to the other interested governments as soon as possible. This seems to me
                        all the more important in that the most recent political developments make
                        it desirable to meet the envisaged signature date, if possible.</p>
                    <p>The main reason for this view is the danger that the forthcoming General
                        Assembly of the United Nations may adopt a resolution calling on us to
                        suspend all negotiations and other arrangements which might in any way alter
                        the status quo in the area of control of atomic weapons, pending the
                        conclusion of an agreement on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons. Other
                        resolutions opposing the establishment of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> are also within the realm of possibility. In Geneva clear
                        tendencies in this direction have become discernible among the uncommitted
                        states.</p>
                    <p>I therefore consider it important that we take some step that will tend to
                        ensure the establishment of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> before
                        such a resolution is adopted in the General Assembly—which might happen as
                        early as January 1965.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0109"/>
                    <p>For me there is also another reason: if I do meet with Mr. Khrushchev I
                        should first like to see something definite accomplished with regard to the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Because of these considerations I deem it desirable to sign the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Treaty as early as the end of November or
                        the beginning of December of this year.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, it is not to be expected that all eight of the interested
                        governments will be prepared at that time to sign. Perhaps we may still be
                        able to persuade some government or other to sign with us. However, we must
                        be prepared for the possibility that no third or fourth government can make
                        a decision to sign at that time. It is my belief that, even so, we should
                        take the lead in order by our example to spur others to accession. In such
                        an eventuality we should, however, consider how we might by some appropriate
                        clause in the Treaty avoid misinterpretations and the impression that we
                        wish to place the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> solely on a
                        U.S.-German basis.</p>
                    <p>We have developed some ideas about this which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>, who will transmit this note, might
                        explain.</p>
                    <p>On this occasion Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> can
                        also set forth our ideas on the question of how we might in connection with
                        the conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Treaty achieve
                        better coordination and consultation in the field of overall nuclear
                        strategy and thereby perhaps make it easier for some states that are still
                        hesitant to join the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">German NATO Permanent Representative <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Wilhelm Grewe</persName> delivered the letter to

                            October 2. In a private conversation at that time, <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> raised the issue of coordination
                            and consultation with the United States on overall nuclear strategy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied “firmly” that
                            while the United States was willing to consult about nuclear strategy,
                            it was “not willing to give any veto or any control over the U.S.
                            nuclear deterrent to countries who were not taking the same commitments
                            and risks in the world.” (Memorandum of conversation; Department of

                    </list>
                    <p>The Under Secretary opened by saying that there is no ambiguity in President
                        Johnson's interest in the Multilateral Force. He wishes to move ahead with
                        the force.</p>
                    <p>As regards timing, the Under Secretary said that the US is in favor of
                        keeping to the agreed schedule. Following the British election and after
                        further developments in Italy and the Netherlands, the US hopes that other
                        countries will get on board quickly.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> that a prompt answer to the Chancellor's letter<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">
                            <ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note> will be forwarded, and that
                        this response would probably be affirmative.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said that he had had
                        useful discussions during his trip to Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s

                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on October 5 are in
                            Department of State, Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>).</note> He emphasized that he had not wished to reopen
                        in Washington the points being discussed in Paris but had felt that
                        discussion on future tactics would be useful. He stressed that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wants to proceed in the most effective way
                        toward creating the force. He agreed that it is important to work closely
                        with the British, the Italians and the Dutch.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold
                            Wilson</persName>'s press conference on October 6 and quoted from the
                        news ticker to the effect that <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        did not think the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> gave Germany a finger
                        on the nuclear trigger because of an American veto. The Under Secretary said
                        that American officials have discussed this subject on a number of occasions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, and it is their
                        impression that he wants to retain freedom of maneuver. <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> said he thought the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was not too far from the defense doctrine of the Labor
                        Party in the UK.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked about the position of Dutch Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>. Ambassador Grewe replied
                        that <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> seemed to be in a 50–50
                        position. In principle he seems positive toward the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> but is reluctant as regards timing. He claims to have
                        trouble with his parliament on this, even though Luns' staff does not appear
                        to see any great difficulty here. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                        also is looking to the British attitude. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> stressed the importance of
                        proceeding as far as possible in the eight-nation working group in Paris and
                        of continuing the bilateral US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        discussions in Paris at the same time.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked whether the UK was taking an active role in the
                        eight-nation group. Ambassador Grewe replied that the UK position varies.
                        Sometimes they are cooperative and sometimes they delay. On several
                            issues—<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> flag, legal status of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and disciplinary rules for <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> personnel—the UK has reopened discussions
                        and insisted that appropriate principles must be inserted in any <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> charter. The Ambassador said that in his
                        opinion it is not a question of speeding up the work of the eight-nation
                        group but rather a problem of the necessary political will to make
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> asked about press
                        treatment of his visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRI2">Spiers</persName>
                        said there had been little comment in the US press but that Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s statement of October 6
                        regarding the possibility of the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> going it alone was receiving some attention.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> suggested that the
                        best press treatment would be to say that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s visit was a further routine
                        meeting in a series of meetings on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> thought that the
                        German press might want a little more. He suggested that something also be
                        said to the effect that we are adhering to the schedule set forth in the
                            Johnson-<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> communique of
                            June<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">See <ref target="#d26fn3">footnote 3,
                                Document 26</ref>.</note> and that we are studying the question of
                        signatories.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRI2">Spiers</persName> said that the subject of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had come up at the Department's noon
                        briefing, where a statement had been made to the effect that the US hopes as
                        many nations as possible will join and that the question has not come up at
                        this point regarding possible signature by only two nations. It had been
                        added that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s visit
                        does not involve a negotiation. Reference had also been made to the timing
                        indicated in the June communique.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said it should be made clear that the Ambassador's visit
                        does not involve negotiations. It should also be stressed that we want to
                        have as many signatories as possible.</p>

                        thinking on proceeding with the Multilateral Force.</p>
                    <p>We believe the Multilateral Force will have great political and military
                        value to NATO, to both our countries, and to our common objectives. In
                        providing a framework for a greater sharing of the responsibilities for the
                        nuclear defense of the Alliance, we expect it will add a new and promising
                        dimension to partnership between the United States and Europe.</p>
                    <p>The best way to insure maximum participation in the Multilateral Force at the
                        outset is for our countries to demonstrate the importance we attach to this
                        project. For this reason I agree we should hold to the timing goal set forth
                        in our communique of last June,<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">See <ref target="#d26fn3">footnote 3, Document 26</ref>.</note> and also to
                        the purpose of making sure that we do not allow this great undertaking to be
                        represented as merely a German-American venture.</p>
                    <p>After the British elections, we should be able to make a more precise
                        judgment about which other governments will be ready to participate and how
                        we ought to proceed. In the meantime, our representatives in Paris should
                        get on with their jobs as expeditiously as possible. Issues which will need
                        resolution at a high level to insure early completion of the Charter should
                        be identified clearly and as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you also mention the prospect of using the Multilateral Force
                        to improve nuclear consultation within the Alliance. This is a most
                        important subject. We have given it much thought and would be glad to
                        discuss it with your government promptly, and to learn of your thinking on
                        the matter. In this connection, I have given considerable thought to a <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0113"/>possible meeting with Western leaders
                        after our elections. I am sure you understand that I cannot make any firm
                        commitments or proposals until after the elections. But if I am chosen to go
                        on, I intend to be in touch with you very soon thereafter to discuss our
                        next steps.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>This airgram summarizes the principal subjects discussed during the recent
                        visit to Washington by NATO Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Manlio Brosio</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> met with the President and the Secretaries of State,
                        Defense, and Treasury, as well as many other U.S. officials. The basic
                        issues discussed were: (1) East-West Relations; (2) French Attitude Toward
                        NATO; (3) NATO Force Planning Exercise; (4) Multilateral Force; (5)
                        Greek-Turkish Relations; (6) US Contribution to NATO Expenses; and (7)

                            found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Arrangements for this visit probably exceeded any previous visit by a NATO
                        Secretary General. They included the Presidential plane from <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0114"/>New York to Washington, an honor guard, a
                        large luncheon hosted by the President, and a trip with the President to
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> Headquarters at Omaha.</p>
                    <p>This was essentially a “get acquainted” visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> appears to be aware that he is ushering in a new
                        phase in the life of NATO and that his record as Secretary General may
                        depend upon his ability to adapt NATO to a new set of political requirements
                        in a rapidly changing world. He favors close political consultation in NATO
                        on all issues and would like to see NATO used to arrive at coordinated
                        policies on world issues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        sees his role as that of the honest broker. Although he gave the impression
                        that he does not wish to take sides publicly on issues which are divisive,
                        he appears personally to support most of our policies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thought it was important
                        that NATO have an active role in considering East-West relations. Otherwise,
                        individual members would tend to follow their own path with the Soviets.
                        NATO should be the center for consultation, for exchanges of information,
                        and coordination of positions. This was the only protection against the
                        Soviets trying to take advantage of differences among the members. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was of the opinion any
                        meaningful rapprochement with the Russians was likely to be achieved in the
                        context of the German problem, not disarmament. The situation was now at a
                        fluid stage, with the Soviet Union-Communist China conflict bringing a
                        momentary reduction of tensions, and perhaps we were at the beginning of a
                        period of change in which the Soviet Union would come forward with something
                        “sensible”. From his conversations with the Soviet Ambassador in Paris he
                        had the impression the Soviets might look more seriously at a settlement in
                        Europe. He was interested in the prospective contacts between the Germans
                        and the Soviet Union and thought that the French policy also bore
                        watching.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that it was
                        urgent and important to get a common appreciation of what is going on in the
                        Communist world. He suggested the Political Advisers Committee discuss the
                        matter, bringing in experts from capitals as desirable, in preparation for
                        discussion at the December Ministerial Meeting. At the time of the Meeting,
                        the question should be taken up both from the point of view of Eastern
                        Europe and the Soviet-Chinese Communist relationship. There was very
                        considerable movement in the Eastern European situation and we could expect
                        some initiatives from one side or the other, or both, although there is not
                        as yet any serious basis for initiatives which hold promise of serious
                        negotiations. There is feeling in Germany, principally atmospheric at this
                        point, about the need for a new move for reunification. It is hard to see
                        such a move which does not involve substantially new security arrangements
                        in Europe and the Germans do not seem to be prepared to address themselves
                        to this aspect of the problem. The territorial question is also difficult.
                            <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0115"/>The United States has registered
                        its willingness to discuss the problem if the other three powers are
                        prepared to move together.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. French Attitude Toward NATO </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> stated that on a continuing
                        basis, his principal preoccupation since he took over as Secretary General
                        has been the French attitude toward NATO. He summarized the major points of
                        DeGaulle's position: (1) DeGaulle thinks that although the threat has
                        diminished the Alliance is still necessary; (2) he remains adamantly opposed
                        to the Alliance, at the same time refusing to suggest changes in the treaty
                        or the organization; (3) he stresses European unity as a key factor; (4) he
                        persists in his opposition to any change in Alliance strategy, doubting that
                        the United States would use nuclear weapons in defense of Europe; and, (5)
                        he continues to be concerned with the unavoidable effect of political events
                        in the outside world on the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> concluded that DeGaulle
                        would not do anything for the present, but in 1969 might well denounce the
                        treaty. This made it most urgent that the Alliance members act in advance to
                        forestall events in 1969. We would need to get the French to say what they
                        want, initiating proposals in order to get them to express their views. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> did not think it reasonable
                        to try to have initiatives for changing the organization until after the
                        German elections in 1965, but certainly they should be undertaken from 1966
                        on.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. NATO Force Planning Exercise</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said there was no
                        possibility of reaching agreed force goals by December. Both the Alpha and
                        Bravo goals of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> are qualitatively
                        unattainable; either might cost an additional $20–$25 billion above present
                        force expenditures over the five-year period. He felt that no attempt should
                        be made to reach conclusions to be presented at the Ministerial Meeting. It
                        would suffice for the <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss> to develop a
                        progress report which could be reviewed by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and by a Defense Ministers meeting in December. He
                        expressed the opinion that unless “some government” took the initiative of
                        leadership the others would never reach the point of developing conclusions
                        on goals and strategy which it was hoped this Exercise would produce. One
                        method to exercise the leadership he feels is required would be to proceed
                        immediately to discussions on strategy and request the military to fix force
                        goals corresponding to the strategies discussed. United States views on
                        reorienting the Exercise should be presented in the DPWG rather than <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> where opposing views might become too
                        rigidly fixed. He expressed his concern over the stature of the <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss>, pointing out that many of the national
                        delegations are staffed by representatives having little knowledge of the
                        subject and virtually no authority and adding that the major NATO commanders
                        tend to consider the DPWG as a group of amateurs. He would <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0116"/>hope that delegations could be bolstered
                        with senior military experts from member countries, even on an ad hoc
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>In meetings with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        and officials of the Department of State, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was informed that we attach great importance to the
                        NATO Force Planning Exercise and to moving ahead with it as rapidly as
                        possible. We believe that the structure of the <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss> and the Defense Planning Committee (<gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>) is a good one, but that the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>, on which the Permanent Representatives
                        sit, should take a more vigorous part in overseeing the working of the
                            <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss>. This would bring the
                        Secretary-General, as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>,
                        into closer contact with the problem areas. Mr. Brosio is in a position to
                        influence the progress of the Exercise and we would welcome his taking an
                        active role.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said a December
                        Ministers of Defense meeting should be planned tentatively. A final decision
                        could be made in late November. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> had said he preferred that an <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> meeting not be separate, but favored setting aside an
                        afternoon during the regular meeting. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not disagree.) If an interim report from the
                            <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss> were presented to the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> by November 20, we could prepare comments
                        by December 14 at the Ministers Meeting. The United States contribution
                        would not be in the form of hard recommendations based on definite
                        conclusions, but would offer alternative strategies for examination.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Multilateral Force</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> regarded the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a desirable project which will add to
                        NATO's strength and go far toward meeting the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> problem. However, it is a military force with its own
                        quasi-political institutions. He wanted to explore the functions and powers
                        of these institutions and the relationship they will have to NATO. He had
                        been informed of the acceleration of the schedule for conclusion of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> agreement and thought that at this
                        stage it would be useful to have contact established between <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        Working Group. This would ensure, from both the military and political
                        points of view, that the arrangements evolved in such a way that others
                        would not be able to create difficulties and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be a strengthening rather than divisive development
                        for the Alliance. He feared the situation might arise in which the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working Group would have agreed on a
                        statute which then would be presented as a fait accompli to the Council.
                        Although it was difficult to foretell French actions, the possibility that
                        they might go so far as to use the MLF as a pretext for creating a major
                        crisis in the Alliance was reason enough to prepare procedures for relating
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to NATO which would avoid criticism
                        and objections.</p>
                    <p>He was told that although the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working
                        Group was ready to discuss its activities with the rest of the Council after
                        a number of problems had been resolved, to do so at this moment might be
                        premature and <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0117"/>disrupting. We expect
                        to keep the Secretary General fully informed on an informal basis, and
                        remain ready to consider more formalized reporting arrangements from the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working Group to the Secretary
                        General at such time as they may seem desirable. The Council would have an
                        opportunity to examine the agreement and recommend changes when it went to
                        governments before the end of the year. Hopefully, we see as one of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>'s greatest advantages an opportunity to
                        establish the principle that NATO must be sufficiently flexible to allow
                        like-minded allies to work together while keeping all informed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Greek-Turkish Relations</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was doubtful that either the
                        United Nations General Assembly or the efforts of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediator Galo Plaza would lead to anything helpful in the
                        Cyprus situation from the point of view of NATO. The General Assembly could
                        pass resolutions but could not alter a treaty. Galo Plaza could make no
                        headway without Makarios' consent. If no progress were made, perhaps Greece
                        and Turkey would face the fact that they need to engage in direct
                        negotiations. The question then became, Who would lead them? No matter who
                        it might be, whether NATO or a representative from the United States, the
                        matter must be kept secret to avoid publicity which might endanger the
                        possibility of successful negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that
                        the United States had proceeded from the beginning on the assumption that no
                        negotiations had a chance if Makarios were directly involved. Makarios wants
                        to be free of both the treaty and Greece, achieving total independence, and
                        is seeking to nurture a “self-determination” atmosphere which will inhibit
                        the Turks. As one step, he hopes to use the Cairo non-aligned conference to
                        get endorsement of self-determination for Cyprus and de facto freedom from
                        the Zurich accords. Meanwhile, Cyprus has become an internal political
                        problem of the first order in Turkey and the situation there continues to
                        deteriorate. At the same time, the Greek Government is realizing that it
                        must settle a situation which contributes to Communist strength, upsets
                        capital investment in Greece, and cuts the tourist trade. There is a growing
                        will to settle the issues through reconciliation with the Turks. The Under
                        Secretary wondered whether the Greek Government would be willing to give
                        enough concessions. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        agreed that the most recent Greek position, described as enosis with
                        protection of minorities, continuation of UK bases, and a NATO base with
                        Turk participation, did not represent progress, backing away as it did from
                        a Turkish base. The Under Secretary added that he expected pressures from
                        Makarios to revive in November.</p>
                    <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0118"/>
                    <p>Before leaving Paris, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> had
                        been informed that the Greek Government refused to accept the 1956
                            resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">For text of the Resolution on the
                            Peaceful Settlement of Disputes and Differences Between Members of the
                            North Atlantic Treaty Organization, December 14, 1956, see Department of
                            State Bulletin, January 7, 1957, p. 17.</note> as a basis for his
                        examining Greek-Turkish relationships. It was, however, prepared to discuss,
                        within the limits of the “watching brief,” measures to foster Greek-Turkish
                        cooperation which would not touch on Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said it was difficult to make any real headway with
                        the Greeks and Turks since one could go only so far before running up
                        against Cyprus, a matter in which NATO could not intervene. Still he was
                        willing to try to do something. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought it was important and most useful to
                        create a beginning of direct Greek-Turkish conversations. This would be the
                        first time they had been willing to talk together and while talks went on,
                        the Greeks would be able to work towards improved control of the island for
                        action at a later date.</p>
                    <p>6. US Contribution to NATO Expenses</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> inquired as to our
                        intentions toward reducing the United States share of contributions to the
                        Infrastructure Program to 25%. He was unaware of any economic reasons for
                        the United States position. The reaction of other delegations was not
                        promising and although his staff had explored numerous criteria for
                        evaluating national contributions, none had produced an obvious
                        justification for the reduction. United States insistence on negotiating on
                        Slice XVI and refusal to discuss further Slices has raised suspicions among
                        other delegations concerning the ultimate reduction we will seek, even
                        though, as he believes, they are coming to realize that some modification
                        may be necessary. As an approach to negotiations he suggested the United
                        States agree to contribute to Slice XVI at the present rate but work toward
                        the possibility that when an agreed percentage is reached for Slices XVII
                        through XX it would be retroactive for Slice XVI as well. In order to place
                        the entire question of cost sharing in its proper perspective he suggested
                        the United States also be prepared to negotiate its proposed reductions of
                        contributions to the civil and military budget in the same framework.</p>
                    <p>In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s view, the solution to
                        the question could have psychological and political repercussions and he
                        cautioned against undercutting our position of primacy in the Alliance by
                        placing other members in the position of contributing at the same or higher
                        levels than we. An uncompromisingly rigid position would give “some country”
                        the opportunity to force acceptance of its view that national infrastructure
                        is preferable to a common program. If presented a convincing case with
                        latitude to maneuver he will make every effort to assist the United States
                        in reaching a satisfactory solution.</p>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0119"/>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> explained
                        that strong Congressional feeling exists that the United States'
                        contribution is high in proportion to the economic ability of other members
                        to share the burden. While Congressional interest may overemphasize the
                        issue, the United States contribution figure of 30% has become a subject of
                        contention. Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> are under considerable
                        pressure from Congress to reduce the burden. It was emphasized that our
                        interest in a reduction in no way implies a lessening of United States
                        support for the Alliance, but represents a search for a method of continuing
                        full support in the face of legislative criticism of what appears to be an
                        imbalance.</p>
                    <p>7. Consultation on Disarmament Issues in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, Director of <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, raised the question of how to handle
                        disarmament issues in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. When the subject
                        of disarmament is raised at the next <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly, the Soviets probably will press the United States on: (1)
                        non-proliferation; (2) general disarmament; and possibly, (3) the peaceful
                        settlement of territorial disputes. The proposal for a freeze on nuclear
                        delivery vehicles, the observation posts, and the Gomulka plan may also be
                        topics of discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> felt
                        time was wasted by asking <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to concentrate
                        on the details of these issues. He thought the consultation process would be
                        improved if NAC were asked to express its views on substantive policy and
                        strategy and not on the wording of proposals which are to be put to the
                        Soviets. He cited the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions on
                        observation posts and on a freeze on nuclear delivery vehicles as examples
                        of too much attention to detail.</p>
                    <p>Without addressing himself directly to the question raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should
                        be seized of the problems when they are still negotiable and not frozen. He
                        said he would take Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s
                        suggestions into consideration. He expected to discuss disarmament issues
                        with Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> as
                        well.</p>

                    <head>40. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On June 4, 1964, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> discussed with <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Robert R.
                            Bowie</persName>, Director of the Harvard University Center for
                        International Affairs, the possibility of his preparing a study “of how the
                        Atlantic nations might improve their structures and procedures for
                        concerting policy and action.” <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        asked that the study be completed in the fall and that it consider the
                        contingencies that President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> remained in power beyond 1965 or that he left office
                        at the end of that year. (Memorandum of conversation, June 4; Department of

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> consulted extensively with
                        officials in the Departments of State and Defense and in July visited Europe
                        where he continued discussions with U.S. representatives in London, Bonn,
                        Paris, Brussels, and Rome and with various foreign officials. Bowie visited
                        Europe again in September for a meeting with key U.S. officials at London
                        before drafting his report.</p>
                    <p>The resulting 25-page report, completed on October 15 and transmitted to Rusk
                        5 days later, began with the premise that Atlantic relations were at a
                        critical stage, and concluded that NATO should be reorganized to include a
                        strengthened executive, six ministerial meetings each year, and expanded
                        political consultations. With regard to military questions, Bowie proposed
                        the creation of a Defense Minister with an integrated planning staff,
                        abolition of the Standing Group, attachment of the Military Committee to the
                        Defense Minister, and the creation of a central integrated reserve force to
                        lay the basis for the integration of all NATO forces. A copy of the report

                        cited to the Chancellor the communique issued by the French Information
                        Minister on October 21 on the question of the organization of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural market.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">For text of this statement, in which France threatened

                        recalled the position we had taken with <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0121"/>the Germans on this question. Although we did not consider
                        a <gloss target="#t_UGP1">UGP</gloss> to be required for a successful
                        Kennedy Round, except perhaps at the end of 1965 or the beginning of 1966,
                        we had always attempted to make it clear that the Germans themselves must
                        make the decision as to whether a <gloss target="#t_UGP1">UGP</gloss> was
                        required by the situation existing within the Common Market. In his view,
                        would General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s obvious
                        threat lead the Germans to a reappraisal of this situation?</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied vigorously and without hesitation that this “menace
                        (threat) has nearly made it impossible.” He would not have made the <gloss target="#t_UGP1">UGP</gloss> decision in any event. However, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s position has only served to
                        stiffen the German position. It would have been hard for them to take this
                        decision in the first place, however, they are now “almost bound not to.”
                        They had committed themselves not to a favorable decision but to a
                        declaration by Dec. 15. Germany was in no way in default on agricultural
                        matters under the Rome Treaty. As a matter of fact they had given in to
                        France in many ways in which they had not been required to, i.e., the
                        agricultural regulations affecting dairying, meat, etc.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, he was becoming increasingly unhappy about the
                        development of the various Common Market regulations on agriculture. The
                        Common Market has “glided into them as if in a traum.” It was clear that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wanted Europe to raise
                        everything it could for itself and to purchase only what they could not
                        raise. He understood the problem which the various regulations had created
                        and would continue to create for us. It was, moreover, unreasonable to ask
                        Germany to make a decision in 1964 as to the price of wheat in 1966. He
                        could not take such a decision until after the German elections. It would be
                        difficult then but the “great pressure” (i.e. political) would be off. He
                        appreciated the U.S. position in this matter to the effect that it was not
                        necessary to reach a grain price decision until that time. I did not attempt
                        further to clarify our position.</p>

                        strong and clear. This matter has, according to an assistant, been discussed
                        with the Cabinet since the French announcement; however, no vote was taken.
                        The Chancellor had taken the same position in the Cabinet meeting that he
                        had taken with me. My informant cautioned me, however, that those who might
                        be inclined to accede to de Gaulle's demands had not yet had their innings
                        and the position Erhard has taken may not be final. Even with me, he was
                        somewhat equivocal, i.e. his words were “almost bound not to.” I think it
                        extremely important that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s
                        preliminary reactions on this question be held in great confidence, since it
                        would obviously be embarrassing to him and to us if his views became known
                        prematurely and through US channels. I must admit that I have perhaps been
                        overly pessimistic in <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0122"/>my reporting
                        about <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s being able to make an

                        election. Despite the political difficulties this would cause him, he
                        obviously considers this less onerous than the loss of votes he would suffer
                        in the event of a decision now. The US position as he understands it is an
                        important element in his tentative decision. If we have any desire to change
                        his decision, this would be the time to change or clarify our position.</p>

                    <p>At his request Amb. Alphand called on Secretary October 23 for exchange of
                        views recent international developments. It apparent, however, main thrust
                        of Alphand call was to sound out Secretary on status of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and express concern about its realization
                        as alleged divisive element for NATO and Europe. Without being as specific
                        as was French Embassy Counselor <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De

                        700, Ambassador made clear his concern but without admitting to official
                        change in French line that while France would not join <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, it would not oppose membership of other
                        NATO countries.</p>
                    <p>Even after being assured <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would not be
                        outside NATO but would be new force (rather like 16th new member) available
                        to NATO and under its high command, Ambassador insisted <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> by creating new groups of ins and outs
                        within NATO constituted most serious divisive problem confronting
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>Secretary challenged this view pointing out current French policy toward NATO
                        has posed as difficult problem for maintaining NATO <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0123"/>unity as any other. Furthermore, faced with
                        growing possibility of proliferation of national nuclear weapons programs,
                        continuation of present nuclear arrangements could lead to far greater
                        source of disruption for NATO than if nothing done at all along lines now
                        contemplated under <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plus broad international non-dissemination
                        agreement should meet as effectively as possible fears of Soviets and others
                        re German aspect of nuclear weapon problem.</p>
                    <p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> view reported
                        in Reftel that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would produce chill in
                        French-German relations, <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> asked
                        why this would be so in light of declared French policy of not opposing
                        German membership. Obviously discomfited, Alphand evaded direct reply.</p>
                    <p>While Alphand claimed he was expressing own views and not on instructions, it
                        apparent he pursuing at higher level <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De

                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> emphasized what he had
                        to say represented preliminary thinking Labor Government and should not be
                        regarded as concrete proposals. Labor recognized time had come for decision
                        on nuclear matters within alliance and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                        had no intention create delay. He thought by time of anticipated Wilson
                        visit to U.S. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would be prepared for more
                        definitive discussion.</p>
                    <p>What <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was thinking of was, Gordon Walker
                        said, a larger nuclear force consisting of British V-bombers, British
                        Polaris submarines, if <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> decided to buy a
                        certain number of them (three or four), an equivalent number of American
                        Polaris submarines, and a mixed-manned element (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>), which would play a less conspicuous role than originally
                        planned. UK element would be committed unconditionally with no “national
                        interest” withdrawal clause. Whole force would be co-targeted with U.S.
                        national nuclear deterrent. Britain would like veto in new force but
                        considered American veto essential.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> went on to say <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would prefer not to participate in
                        mixed-manned <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> element of proposed new
                        force except perhaps on token basis. He thought Labor Government would be
                        able to cope with political opposition in UK to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> if <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> part larger force.
                        On other hand, Labor was opposed to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as
                        isolated step and would be most unhappy if U.S. went ahead alone with
                        Germany on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> also repeatedly stressed his conviction that
                        Germany would not be satisfied for long with participation in <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> unless it part of larger force he had
                        outlined.</p>
                    <p>Secretary and Under Secretary in turn emphasized our aim was to draw Germany
                        permanently to West. While there was little present German insistence on
                        nuclear capability, future pressures could bring about dangerous change in
                        German attitude unless solution reached which Germany could reconcile with
                        her national interest. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would give
                        Germany both propinquity to weapons and share in control which should
                        satisfy German aspirations for long time to come. Our preliminary reaction
                        was that even though UK were to commit its Polaris submarines to proposed
                        new force, this would fall short of minimum degree participation by UK
                        required. Failure UK participate substantially in <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could be taken by Germans as form of discrimination—<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was considered by British as being good
                        enough for Germany but not good enough for UK.</p>

                        Both financial and political considerations were mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>. Point he stressed most
                        repeatedly as real problem with <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was that
                        it would not satisfy Germany in long run.</p>

                        conversation that it was highly desirable that initiative for creation of

                        UK and Germany, rather than U.S. and UK. No direct or implied commitment was

                    <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> General Objectives and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> expressed the view that we
                        should consider any <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> arrangement
                        satisfactory which met German emotional needs for first class membership in
                        the immediate future without worrying about whether the force provided
                        Britain with such a special position that it would lead to subsequent German
                        demands for equal treatment.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated that he viewed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as just “a step in an evolutionary process” towards greater
                        European integration.</p>
                    <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0126"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> agreed and stated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be hard to achieve in view of
                        hardening French opposition. He would be willing to settle for anything we
                        could get that would include UK, German, Italian and US participation and
                        would provide something to build on.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated that if we started with a force which had two
                        types of units—(1) national and (2) mixed-manned—the former might move in
                        the direction of mixed-manning at a subsequent date, but the very existence
                        of a national component would probably lead to German demands for similar
                        national components of their own.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that next issue of
                        “Time” would contain a report from Bonn that the Germans were disturbed at
                        the reported US–UK delay in timing of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The story also indicated that the Germans thought the UK
                        proposals put forward by the Labor Government were so extensive that it
                        would be unlikely if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could be agreed
                        upon before the German election, which would be a setback to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> stated the view that neither
                        the Italians nor the Dutch would be ready to move on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> before January 1, and therefore the German hope of a
                        year-end signing was bound to be disappointed.</p>
                    <p>The German timing question was discussed at some length, and it was agreed
                        that there was probably no magic in the January 15 date the Germans have
                        been citing as essential for the start of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> debate, although the Bundestag recess in late June was a
                        fixed final date. There was a consensus that the calendar was being used
                        unduly as a reason for expedition by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, but that the Bundestag problem had to be considered in our own
                        scheduling.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion as to whether it would be feasible to let the whole
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>-Atlantic nuclear force question
                        slide for two or three years. Were we really sure whether we would be better
                        off after the creation of an Atlantic force? Wasn't there more stability in
                        the present situation than we gave credit for, since the Germans were not
                        about to proliferate? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                        suggested that these questions should at least be addressed consciously as
                        part of the policy-making process.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought it would be
                        disadvantageous to delay these decisions. The number one asset we have going
                        for us in Europe at the moment is confidence in US judgment and initiatives,
                        and this would be gone if we delayed much longer. He thought that the forces
                        for proliferation in the world, particularly in Asia, were greater than we
                        had anticipated prior to the Chinese detonation. It was agreed that there
                        was nothing to be gained by delay and that there would probably be very
                        little change in the picture after German and French elections next
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> expressed the hope that the
                        arguments for proceeding now would not be dominated by the arguments about
                        meeting German desires but with the affirmative gains of creation of a
                        genuine Atlantic force.</p>

                    <p>(b) France and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> stated that the force must
                        be “plausibly open to the French”, and one of the key problems here is that
                        if we insist on members making a commitment “for the life of the Alliance”
                        this is precisely the thing that de Gaulle would be most opposed to.</p>
                    <p>(There was discussion of the withdrawal provision in the NATO Charter, and it
                        was agreed that during the 20-year period provided in the Treaty or
                        thereafter if the Organization is extended, withdrawal would require
                        one-year notice.)</p>
                    <p>The suggestion was made without resolution that the duration clause in the
                        new force charter might provide that it remain in being as long as the UK
                        was an active participant, since this might be longer than the “life of the
                        NATO Alliance” in view of French threats.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bundy suggested that we should permit the French to join at a subsequent
                        date by permitting participation of “another kind of nuclear force”, such as
                        it suggested by the French proposal for “coordination” of the Mirage force
                        with the Alliance. He thought that it would be a mistake to treat the
                        Atlantic force as something that required the participation of all members'
                        nuclear forces in being, as <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> had urged at
                        one time.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could not be made
                        palatable to the French, because it was in direct conflict with the French
                        objective of an independent Europe and because of its decisively Atlantic
                        character.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> would be
                        responsible for seeing that the US proposal was made in a form and at a time
                        as compatible as possible to reasonable elements in France to minimize
                        opportunities for Gaullist attacks against it as a conspiracy against France
                        and Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> will obtain
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>'s views on these
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>(c) The UK, <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and a Broader Atlantic
                        Nuclear Force</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated if the UK agreed to put its Polaris into an
                        Atlantic force subject to US permissive link safeguards, with transfer of
                        ownership and flag to an Atlantic command, it would be hard for the Labor
                        Government to justify it to the British people since it would cost far more
                        than participation in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Mr. Bundy
                        stated he thought the Labor Government merely wanted to be able to say to
                        its people that it had part of the British Navy attached to the NATO
                        Command.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> noted that it would
                        cost the British about $650 million to build three Polaris units, which
                        might constitute one-fourth of the force which they now contemplate, as set
                        forth in the Gwynn-Jones' article.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Reference is
                            to Alun Gwynne-Jones' article in the London Times, October 23, 1964,
                            which sketched the outline of a new British proposal for participation
                            in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0128"/>
                    <p>The minimal manpower contribution the UK might make to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was discussed and it was decided it would
                        be in the neighborhood of a thousand men in a five-thousand-man force.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that from the US viewpoint it would be ideal for the US and
                        Europe to have separate vetoes over all units in the Atlantic nuclear force,
                        but it was assumed that the UK also hoped for a third veto of its own.</p>
                    <p>There was a consensus that we should not push the Germans and Italians too
                        much until the British have “sniffed the air” in both Rome and Bonn, but we
                        should approach the Germans with our views on the British proposals before
                        the Wilson December visit.</p>
                    <p>(d) The December Crises: <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Agricultural
                        Policy and the Kennedy Round</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that we were building
                        up towards a year-end crisis in two major areas: (1) the failure of the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to come up with a common grains
                        price proposal which is a prerequisite to a Common Market agricultural
                        accord; and (2) the French threat to torpedo the Kennedy Round. Taken as a
                        package this posed a threat both to the other <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> members and to the US. He noted that on <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural policies, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was on the right track and had
                        all <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> members except Germany with him.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the Under Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> will do a paper on the various strands of the December
                        crisis and the implications for the debate on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and any broader Atlantic nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>It was recalled that the Germans had promised the French only to state a view
                        on a grains price for the Common Market by December 15, but they had also
                        promised us not to let the grains price question interfere with the Kennedy
                        Round. Arguing from the latter commitment, we should attempt to persuade
                        them to come up with an acceptable <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked if there was any way
                        that we could take the blame publicly to permit Erhard to come forward with
                        an acceptable grains price proposal in time to permit Common Market
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>The question of delaying the Kennedy Round and its importance vis-a-vis
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was discussed. It was agreed that
                        the French would oppose the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> regardless
                        of Common Market or Kennedy Round developments, and there were many
                        disadvantages in any KR delay.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated the view that the US
                        had made a mistake in advising the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> last
                        June that there was no technical reason why the Kennedy Round could not go
                        ahead without a grains price agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> support in Germany was based in large
                        measure on the rural vote and the farmers would probably sit out the next
                        election if <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> caved on a common
                        grains price. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> has been silent
                        on the question to date but he does not depend on the farm vote for
                        support.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(e) Schedule</p>
                    <p>After extended discussion the following tentative schedule was agreed to:</p>

                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was arranging on November
                        11–13. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would be there, and if
                        they remained in Germany until the 16th, they could get a report on
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>'s talks with
                        Schroeder on the 14th-15th. It was thought to be desirable to stop in London
                        on the way back from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> for another
                        round of talks before the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        visit. Rome was another possible stop on this trip, although it did not seem
                        to be necessary, and would conflict with the November 22 Italian
                        elections.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> would come to the

                        Parliament recesses, and before Christmas. In view of the Secretary's
                        absence (he leaves New York for Paris on December 12), pre NATO bilaterals
                        and big 4 FonMin meetings in Paris December 13–14, and the NATO meeting from
                        December 15 to 18, December 21 and 22 seem to be preferred dates for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> visit.</p>

                        by UK personnel to make the system operative and to permit necessary

                        subs. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> noted that

                        possible alternatives for the Atlantic Nuclear Force:</p>
                    <p>-1-An <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> consisting only of a mixed-manned
                        surface component with the British share rendered at once equal and cheap
                        and with British subs converted for hunter-killer purposes (or at any rate
                        left separate).</p>
                    <p>-2-An <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> with two components, one of them
                        mixed-manned (as above) and the other subsurface—consisting of British
                        submarines and maybe an equal number of American submarines assigned
                        irrevocably, and under the control of the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> governing board with control enforced through a two key
                        system (as well as through some element of at least binational manning).</p>
                    <p>-3-An <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> in either of the variants above
                        with a third component: aircraft and/or Pershings.</p>
                    <p>Note: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> suggested the paper,
                        but the Under Secretary volunteered to do it himself. G/PM expertise might
                        be utilized here.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the group would meet again on Thursday, November 5, at a
                        time to be arranged by Mr. Read. (11:00 a.m., November 5, 1964, set
                            subsequently.)<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">On November 3, the principal
                            officers of the Department of State directly concerned with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> met in Under Secretary Ball's
                            conference room to discuss the British proposal. While no conclusion was
                            reached at the meeting, three alternatives were considered: 1) The
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as presently contemplated, 2)
                            commitment of British nuclear forces to either an Atlantic or Allied
                            force; or 3) mixed-manning of British Polaris submarines. (Memorandum of
                            conversation; Department of State, Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>)) At the November 5 meeting of the
                            interagency <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> group, the participants
                            discussed further permissive links, the inclusion of aircraft and
                            missiles in the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, mixed-manning of
                            British Polaris submarines, and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>
                            ownership of the British submarines. The meeting concluded that the
                            United States should not express its position on these topics pending
                            further talks with the Europeans. (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.) At
                            another meeting on November 10, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                            group heard a report from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, who was certain the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be acceptable to the Labour government as long as
                            it was part of an overall deal on defense matters. The group also
                            considered a paper that outlined various alternatives on the employment
                            of the British Polaris submarines. (Memorandum of conversation with

                    <p>1742. I called on Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        late yesterday at my request. He expressed appreciation for the letter from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> of November <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0131"/>2 (Bonn 1268),<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.) The letter stressed that the
                            U.S.-U.K. talks had covered a wide range of topics and that the British
                            had outlined some preliminary ideas about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</note> delivered to him the previous day, which dealt
                        principally with the recent discussions with British FonSec <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> in Washington on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Chancellor said that he would reply to
                        the President shortly.</p>
                    <p>Without elaborating, the Chancellor volunteered that we would see a new
                        political situation in Bonn tomorrow. He was obviously referring to the
                        results he anticipated from a series of intensive meetings he had been
                        holding during the day with <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Party leaders in an attempt to achieve
                        party harmony. This is being reported separately in Embtel 1741.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Dated November 4. (Ibid., POL US–<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> Now that the American elections are about
                        over, direct relations between us must continue. It would, perhaps, be
                        helpful for FonMin <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> to meet
                        soon with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. Later,
                        perhaps after his inauguration, he hoped to receive President Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the question of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, the
                        Chancellor observed that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> says that German participation in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will violate Germany's duty to Europe. The
                        Chancellor believes that he may want to downgrade the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> so as to “push Germany down”. He wanted to
                        make it clear to us that the attitude of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> will in no way influence Germany in its decision to
                        participate in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If Germany were to
                        accede to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s current attack
                        on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> she would become a “laughing
                        stock”. Germany cannot accept a “law laid down” by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Germany cannot “yield to
                        pressure.” Germany will remain firm on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and hopes that the U.S. will.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, the Chancellor said that in the light of recent developments he
                        did not feel that it was possible to sign the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> this year. The effort should not, however, be postponed too
                        long in 1965 otherwise the public will get used to indecision concerning the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and will lose interest in it and
                        fail to support it. In view of the time-table forced on him by the
                        forthcoming German elections, the Chancellor thought we should not delay
                        beyond February 1 at latest.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor felt, moreover, that it is now all the more important that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> come to Europe as
                        soon as convenient after the elections, to talk with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> about “nuclear systems.” Perhaps
                        he will be able to persuade <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        to integrate the force de frappe with other European nuclear efforts. If,
                        however, the President should fail—if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> says no—we must all feel free to proceed in taking the
                        necessary action in the nuclear field. The Chancellor said that he wished to
                        make it clear that what he had in mind was something within NATO, not among
                        a few disintegrated states. He asked me what further details I could give
                        him of the results of the <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> visit.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0132"/>
                    <p>I assured the Chancellor, in the first place, of our continued firm
                        determination to proceed with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as
                        indicated in President Johnson's letter. During the discussions in
                        Washington Gordon <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Walker</persName> had
                        presented no specific alternative to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        as we have planned it. He had indicated a preference for the inclusion of
                        other British nuclear forces on a non-mixed-manned basis, and a desire to
                        minimize both the size and the degree of British participation in the
                        multilateral seaborne force. He had also asked for more time for a
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>We had, however, made no commitments as to any changes in the existing
                        concept of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, or in any extended
                        delay. We had indicated clearly that any changes would have to be in
                        agreement with Germany and our other partners. It is heartening, however,
                        that the new Labour government appears to have such a positive attitude
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and we believed that we
                        should make every effort to see if the matter cannot be negotiated out with
                        them on a basis acceptable to all.</p>
                    <p>In this connection we were particularly interested in <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>'s forthcoming visit to
                        Germany scheduled for November 14. We felt that by this time the British
                        should be in a position to present more specific suggestions to the Germans
                        as to their concept of the nature and composition of the force. We assume
                        that the Germans will listen carefully to what the British have to say,
                        however, we want to make it clear that we do by no means feel the Germans
                        need necessarily accede to all of the British proposals. We have been
                        involved in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> together for a long time
                        and are prepared to play our role alongside the Germans and other
                        participants in whatever negotiations are required with the British.</p>
                    <p>I advised the Chancellor that, in view of the importance of getting on with
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was prepared to come to Bonn to meet
                        with him on November 16 following participation in the fourth
                        German-American conference to be held in Berlin November 12–15 where he
                        would have opportunities for prior discussion with FonMin Schroeder.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would, in addition, wish to
                        discuss with the Chancellor a wide range of other matters, including <gloss target="#t_UGP1">UGP</gloss>, centering around the present impasse in

                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The Chancellor's comments on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as [garble] believed to raise several
                        interesting points of emphasis. He does, in the first place, indicate a
                        sharp reaction against <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        current attempts <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0133"/>to block the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—and a determination to proceed with
                        its development at all costs, seeing in failure to do so a disastrous
                        defeat. He seemed somewhat apprehensive about the results of the <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> talks, perhaps as a result of
                        not being fully advised up to this point on what took place. His suggestion
                        that the signing of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> might be
                        postponed as late as February 1 is the first time, to my knowledge, that we
                        have heard the Germans mention such a late date, and should provide a
                        reasonable compromise between our present January 1 date and the British
                        suggestion of a March date. In any event I feel that Germany could be set
                        off her time schedule if the signing were delayed beyond February 1. I
                        consider it important that we continue to emphasize to the Germans that we
                        will be with them in further negotiations and not leave them alone to
                        negotiate a compromise with the British. Of particular interest is the
                        Chancellor's suggestion that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> make an effort to reach agreement with General de
                        Gaulle on the inclusion of the force de frappe within a European “nuclear
                        system.” Despite his firmness on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, the
                        Chancellor obviously does not relish the prospect of a head-on collision
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and would be much happier, particularly
                        from the standpoint of his internal political opposition, if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and his force de frappe could be
                        integrated into the planning for a European nuclear force.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Where the problem is now</p>
                    <p>When you last saw it, the multilateral force was proceeding through technical
                        discussions in Paris, with a proposed target of agreement among participants
                        by December. This was always optimistic, but the Germans and our <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> advocates both wanted a target to keep the
                        work going. In the last six weeks three things have happened:</p>
                    <p>(1) The Germans rather clumsily gave too strong an impression that we and
                        they might go ahead bilaterally. We gently cooled this idea. But it is still
                        in the background. Our official position is one of supporting this force on
                        a multilateral basis and believing that there will be a number of European
                        participants when the time comes.</p>
                    <p>(2) The British Labour Government has adopted a much more flexible and
                        interested posture than it had taken in opposition. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> advanced unofficial proposals
                        by which the United Kingdom would become a member of a new NATO nuclear
                        group, using its Polaris submarines as its major contribution, with possible
                        add-ons from aircraft and perhaps even a reluctant token contribution to the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> itself. These proposals are
                        carefully unofficial. Our response has been to show interest and to
                        emphasize the importance of finding a system which meets the interests of
                        the Germans. But we recognize and respect the British desire not to buy a
                        whole new weapons system just two years after Nassau (to specialists in this
                        subject, what is fascinating is the very close relation between Labour's
                        current attitude and that of the Home Government—the only important
                        differences are those of political imagery, and on the whole those
                        differences may make it a little easier for Labour than for the
                        Conservatives to join in a new package deal).</p>
                    <p>(3) Meanwhile, back from South America, and ready for bear, General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has been informed that this
                        damnable thing may happen if he doesn't do something about it. From his
                        point of view that would be a disaster, because it would tie the Germans and
                        the British, and probably the Italians and the Dutch, to an Atlantic nuclear
                        defense policy. The General honestly believes in what he calls a European
                        policy. Moreover, both he and his devoted French followers honestly believe
                        that only what is French is European and vice versa. So the French
                        Government, by public statements, background briefings, and diplomatic
                        demarche, has declared that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is
                        hostile to France and incompatible with a proper European policy.</p>
                    <p>2. How the various parts of your Government see it</p>
                    <p>In broad outline, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and I have very similar fundamental views. We believe
                        that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is the least unsatisfactory
                        means of keeping the Germans well tied into the alliance, but we see it as a
                        means, and not an end in itself. We are strongly opposed to a bilateral
                        German-American bargain, although we are willing to make others just <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0135"/>a little bit nervous by refusing to
                        be categorical on this subject in public. We want the British in the game,
                        just as we did at Nassau, and we are not disposed to make their task more
                        difficult by sticking to a rigid formula—or timetable. Guidance has already
                        gone out to the field making it clear that we no longer expect final
                        agreements in December—or even in January.</p>
                    <p>Behind this basic agreement there are divergences. Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> rightly finds the French behavior
                        outrageous, and I think he believes we are required to engage in a public
                        debate against them. To a considerable extent he is surely right, but I
                        feel—and I think Bob does too—that it is important for us to be more polite
                        and more forthcoming than the French deserve, at every stage, in order to
                        weaken their claim that we are deliberately encircling them and trying to
                        prevent a European Europe.</p>
                    <p> Bob McNamara is sometimes torn between his very sound political assessments
                        and his obligations as a salesman of dollar-earning hardware. For example,
                        one significant element in the British position may be their need to keep in
                        the business of producing useable and saleable aircraft. The best way of
                        doing this politically is probably to license the TFX for production under a
                        British name and paint-job, but that might cut into our own TFX market, and
                        so Bob may be resistant. One of our jobs is to introduce <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the statesman to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the merchant and make sure they
                        do not get in each other's way (I am trying to make a beginning on this, but
                        while the statesman always listens to Dean and sometimes to me, the merchant
                        will listen only to you).</p>
                    <p>Potentially more dangerous than these marginal differences among your senior
                        advisers is the fact that for at least two years the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has been handled at lower levels of the Government by men
                        who have a passionate commitment to their own view of Europe, of Germany, of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and of wise U.S. policy. These men
                        are determined to make the Europeans do what is good for them, and at the
                        moment their one and only medicine is the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as it stands. I think <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                            Ball</persName> has softened these men a little in the last two weeks;
                        some of them are now prepared to give a little to the new British
                        Government. But they are still governed by an attitude of rigid hostility to
                        the French, paternalistic domination of the Germans, and a serene conviction
                        that if only Presidents will say what they tell them to, all will be well.
                        They also tend to believe, against all experience, that if Uncle Sam plays
                        the firm nanny, the British can be forced out of the independent nuclear
                        business for their own good.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">On November 9,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> sent a memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stating that he had
                            talked at length with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> that afternoon about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> strongly
                            urged that the United States “should be tough with the British,”
                            believing that the Labour government would do its best to drive a hard
                            bargain but would be surprised if the United States gave in. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> also wanted the Department of
                            State to take full control of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                            negotiations, and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>'s views were at
                            variance with <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>'s.
                            (Ibid.)</note> These men drive the French and the British up the

                    <p>In addition to these troubles within the Executive Branch there is a major
                        Congressional hurdle down the road. A curious collection of liberals, Joint
                        Committee atom-guarders, and neo-isolationists would probably beat the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> today if there were a totally free,
                        silent, secret vote in the Senate. All of this can be turned around if we
                        get a bargain that has wide European support, and it is not an immediate
                        problem, but we should have it in the back of our minds.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Outlines of a solution</p>
                    <p>I strongly believe that this complex and challenging problem can and should
                        be resolved over the next 6 to 9 months. The outlines of an answer are
                        already visible, and they would include:</p>
                    <p>(1) A new name for the enterprise—the one which looks best right now is
                        “Atlantic missile force.”</p>
                    <p>(2) A process of control which gives us a veto over any firing and gives to
                        major European participants a veto over any element to which they themselves
                        have made a major contribution.</p>
                    <p>(3) An ostentatiously open attitude to the French, with repeated invitations
                        to membership and repeated offers of “cooperation” if they choose to stay
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>(4) An interlocking set of financial and political bargains on details in
                        which the dominant object is to make the British and the Germans see their
                        common interest in agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. What you now need to do about it</p>
                    <p>All this will take time, and much careful thought and action. I believe what
                        it requires from the Presidency right now is:</p>
                    <p>(1) A clear signal to all departments that this problem is Presidential
                        business and that all activities in support of U.S. policy in this field
                        must be reported to the White House and have such clearance as the White
                        House requires.</p>
                    <p>(2) An order that all negotiators and travellers working on this problem have
                        written instructions cleared by State, Defense, and the White House (this is
                        important because emissaries of State below Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>

                        <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Calling at his request November 13,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had frank exchange
                        of views with the Secretary on NATO and Atlantic affairs in course of which
                        he delivered broadside against <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>,
                        predicting “very serious situation” if <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        takes shape. Claiming French cannot understand why United States has
                        “suddenly started to press creation <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>” as
                        of “top political priority”, <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                        used whole battery of French arguments that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would:</p>
                    <p>1. Integrate European nations such as Germany into American controlled
                        defense organization outside of NATO dividing latter and making common
                        European defense policy impossible upon which depends attainment of European
                        union.</p>
                    <p>2. Involve smaller European powers in adventure for which they have displayed
                        little enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>3. Whet German appetite for national nuclear program with Germans perhaps
                        using <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as first step toward attainment
                        own nuclear capability. With Germany only European country with unsatisfied
                        territorial claims, such capability could create serious threat for rest of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0138"/>
                    <p>4. Provoke dangerous reaction of Soviets who could regard <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as casus belli.</p>
                    <p>5. Fail serve useful military purpose.</p>
                    <p>On other hand, <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>'s defense of
                        French force de frappe seemed to rest on fact it French controlled and hence
                        wholly European in nature that invested it with “goodness” alien <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> lacking.</p>
                    <p>In vigorous riposte Secretary made following points:</p>
                    <p>1. There has been no change in US position on objectives of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> since plan first put forward to French and
                        world in December 1961. Only difference between then and now is project
                        almost ready for realization.</p>
                    <p>2. It French who in last three weeks have misleadingly changed their policy,
                        since during <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> gestation period, we led to
                        believe France herself uninterested in <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        but not opposed to membership by others.</p>
                    <p>3. Since Germany is closest bullseye for Soviet nuclear missiles, it only
                        natural Germans interested in sharing in nuclear defense strategy which
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would make possible without creation
                        of German national program. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> thus outlet
                        for any German appetite French nuclear capability has whetted.</p>
                    <p>4. US has never contemplated German-US bilateral arrangement which
                        contradiction in terms of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. Under circumstances Soviets could not regard creation <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as hostile act and if accompanied by
                        non-dissemination agreement, their fears would be even more groundless.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would not be outside NATO but under it
                        as source of additional nuclear power like new member, which no more
                        divisive for other NATO members than French force de frappe.</p>
                    <p>7. Talks with other NATO partners have revealed firm support for <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. They regard it as opportunity participate
                        in common nuclear defense of West together with United States, which would
                        not be only member with veto.</p>
                    <p>8. Military experts of eight nation working group has found <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> can make valuable military contribution to
                        strength of alliance.</p>
                    <p> NATO and Europe. In discussing NATO and European situation generally,
                        Secretary thought it would be most helpful if French Foreign Minister could
                        explain specifically what French mean when they talk about need for NATO
                        reorganization and common European defense and foreign policies. So far we
                        just do not know and other European partners seem to share this obscurity.
                        In this connection, Secretary wondered whether French thought European
                        policies ipso facto had to be “different” from US policies when they have so
                        much in common.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> replied unless <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> affected things, he did not foresee any
                        profound changes called for in NATO until Europe in position evolve common
                        defense and foreign policies and enter into “dialogue” with <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0139"/>United States. Eventually to have such
                        “dialogue”, <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> claimed US and
                        European policies would have to be different. In any case, France against US
                        taking European countries “under its wing” and against whole idea of
                        Atlantic integration, which <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                        said he had told Secretary four years ago.</p>
                    <p>Disclaiming any US desire extend maternal wing cover to Europe but
                        reiterating desirability for further clarification of French views on these
                        important matters, Secretary said he would think over <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> suggestion for Secretary and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> getting
                        together for talk after Secretary's arrival December 12 in Paris and before
                        opening of NATO meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">On November 19,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> had a similar

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>, who
                            made most of the same points that <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed that he and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> should have a serious discussion of the question

                            December. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> commented that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> seemed quite relaxed on
                            the subject, while admitting that French policy had changed, and he
                            speculated that the French were waiting to see what effect the new
                            British proposals had before pushing the issue further. (Telegram 3105

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> stated that while
                        there was movement on the problem of grain price unification within the
                        German Government, a final decision has not yet been taken by Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. Defhues is one of the few
                        key members of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> who remains adamantly
                        opposed to a decision at this time. <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>'s view is that even though it is more difficult to
                        take a decision now than it would have been six months ago, the decision is
                        nevertheless necessary and will probably be taken within the next few
                        weeks.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary agreed with President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>'s assessment, and advised him that, in his
                        conversation with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        yesterday, he had urged that Germany take this step. He also felt it was
                        likely that the decision to move ahead would be taken in the near
                        future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> took considerable
                        satisfaction in the Community's decision to table its exceptions list on
                        November 16th. He emphasized, however, that there were many key issues to be
                        resolved within the Community in the next few weeks.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> stressed his hope
                        that the timing of decisions on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be
                        such as to avoid complicating the decisions that must be taken within the
                        European Community. He came back to this theme several times. He indicated
                        no doubt in his mind as to the desirability of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but he placed considerable emphasis on the desirability of
                        allowing the Community to resolve its problems first.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary pointed out that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> would be visiting the United
                        States and the United Kingdom in the next few weeks; that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> would be visiting the
                        United States, and that he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                        would be returning to Paris and possibly to London. He said that, with these
                        diplomatic talks, it would be quite clear that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was an important issue under active discussion. Therefore
                        statements would be made and, of necessity, publicized. Their tone would be
                        such as to indicate forward movement on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Under Secretary left President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> with no illusion that the United
                        States would slow up progress on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He
                        did indicate that the various diplomatic discussions would necessarily take
                        some time.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> described what he
                        felt could be accomplished in a year-end package negotiation within the
                        Community, assuming that the Germans agree to unified grain prices. He felt
                        that agreement should be reached on acceleration of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> internal tariff reductions and progress on
                        a number of items involved in the Erhard proposals. He considered that the
                        words “political unity” were far too strong to describe the specific
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> proposals, but he felt,
                        nevertheless, that there were a number of elements on which agreement would
                        be possible.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJW2">Tuthill</persName> expressed surprise
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> had not
                        mentioned the need for change in the December 1963 Community <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0141"/>mandate in the field of agriculture and the
                        Kennedy Round. President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>
                        asked what in fact would be necessary. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJW2">Tuthill</persName> then listed three elements which,
                        in their view, would have to be changed or reinterpreted in order to allow
                        meaningful agricultural negotiations in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. These were: (1) Clarification that the Community was not
                        expecting its partners to adopt the montant de soutien themselves as a basis
                        for negotiations. (2) An understanding that the use of the montant de
                        soutien as a basis for Community offers would not be so wide as to result,
                        by this means, in a de facto extension of the levy system to a significant
                        range of agricultural products not presently under the variable levy system.
                        (3) Some improvement in the mandate in order to give meaning to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministers' decision to achieve
                        “significant liberalization” i.e., to achieve reduction of protection for
                        some agricultural products.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> appeared somewhat
                        surprised at this position, but Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TJW2">Tuthill</persName> pointed out that these essentials had been discussed
                        in some detail with <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> in
                        Brussels, and with Rabot and Hijzen in Geneva. President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> inquired whether formal agreement
                        on the kind of general rules language discussed at the last bilateral Geneva
                        meeting would fulfill the requirements for creating a better basis for
                        agricultural negotiations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> explained that this was probably not so, since
                        the language involved had been designed to protect both the United States
                        and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> position while postponing
                        further elaboration of the basis for agricultural negotiations. The language
                        in question would not serve to assure that the Community was in a position
                        to meet the three points mentioned above.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> asked when the
                        United States Government felt the Kennedy Round negotiations would be
                        concluded. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> stated that,
                        while the United States Government would like to see the negotiations
                        concluded sometime in 1965, it was recognized that in fact they might run
                        into the early part of 1966. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> raised this question in the context of possible
                        future action on the part of the French blocking the progress in the Kennedy
                        Round. He pointed out that as of January 1966, the French would not have the
                        veto right on the Kennedy Round and similar issues. He stressed once more
                        his well-known conviction that it is essential to get past this date.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> whether he felt that the French might raise
                        questions during 1965 about the January 1, 1966 termination of the unanimity
                        rule in Community decision making on commercial policy and similar matters.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> replied that there
                        had indeed been some indication to this effect. The picture was not clear
                        and one could not be certain what the French Government really had in mind
                        in this regard. With respect to the questions as to the German <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0142"/>attitude regarding the loss of veto,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> pointed out that
                        if Germany had made the decision on the unified grain price, it would not
                        have any reason to fear the veto. President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>Philosophizing on tactics of the Commission, he stated that it was basic
                        Commission policy to concentrate on weaving every thread in the fabric in
                        order to strengthen the Community and thus to make it more difficult for
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to break it up. He
                        stated that the decision to go ahead on November 16 was one such thread and
                        the unified grain price decision would be an even more important one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>'s Personal Political
                        Plans</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> confirmed the
                        newspaper reports that he had been offered a “good” (meaning undoubtedly a
                        safe) constituency in Wuerttemberg-Baden. He stated that he could not have
                        received a more attractive offer should he decide to return to German
                        politics. He stated that he had not made a decision but that he would have
                        to give his friends an answer “early in 1965”.</p>

                    <p>The conversations I have had in Berlin and Bonn over the past three days<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">Reports on <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s conversations with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> on November 16 were transmitted to Bonn in
                            telegrams 1492 and 1494, November 17. (Ibid., Conference Files: Lot 66 D
                            110, CF 2443) For a memorandum of his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> on November 17, see <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note> have led me to the following
                        conclusions:</p>
                    <p>1. The German Government is still eager to go ahead with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In fact, it would regard the failure of
                        the project—or even a substantial delay in concluding an agreement—as a
                        dangerous setback.</p>
                    <p>2. At the same time the Government's ability to negotiate from strength has
                        been materially weakened by termites on the home front. The brutal French
                        attack on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—re-enforced by dark
                        threats of <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0143"/>possible Gaullist
                        reprisals—has become a major element in the bloody internecine fighting
                        within the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. Those threats are providing
                        the ammunition for the so-called Gaullist wing. This is a curiously
                        heterogeneous group (Adenauer, Strauss, Guttenberg, Gerstenmeier, and Krone)
                        whose single point of cohesion is a passionate desire to get rid of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and embarrass <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. Underlying this sabotage operation
                        is a considerable amount of anti-American feeling and a strong strain of
                        resurgent German nationalism.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is regretting the day that he
                        let <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> remain head of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> rather than assuming party leadership
                        himself. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has turned
                        completely sour on Americans—a people, he says in private conversation, who
                        are “not fit to rule”. At the same time, he exhibits a curious love-hate
                        attitude towards de Gaulle, combining his long-time sycophancy with threats
                        that, if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is crossed by the
                        Germans over the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, he will turn East
                        toward Moscow.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is not a party issue; it is merely
                        an intra-<gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> issue. Both Brandt and Erler
                        assured me that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would support
                        it—particularly if the British Labour Government comes on board. The <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> will mostly oppose but they don't count for
                        much.</p>
                    <p>5. On balance, it is fairly clear that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> can still force the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> through the councils of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, since the party hacks don't dare oppose him openly since
                        he is their prize vote-getter. Once past the Government the treaty could be
                        easily pushed through the Bundestag. The Government feels that it cannot
                        delay too long since it is imperative to keep the issue out of the
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>6. Apart from trying to induce the British to take a sensible line, the best
                        way we can help <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and his
                        Government is by making a big show of trying to bring the French along with
                        us. I was asked again and again by anxious Germans what steps we were taking
                        to canvass the whole question with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. How soon was someone going to talk to him? Was the
                        President planning to see him right away? A recounting of all the steps we
                        had taken over the last two years to persuade the French to join was not
                        good enough for the Germans.</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> quite definitely wants the British
                        in but is not yet clear as to the implications of the British proposals.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> apparently was no
                        more precise with the Germans than he was with us. He did manage to create
                        the impression that the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        Government wished to be reasonable and the Germans now have the feeling that
                        the ghost of Vansittart no longer haunts No. 10 Downing Street. The German
                        reaction so far is one of wariness, but they intend to give the British the
                        benefit of the doubt, and they are watching with great interest the efforts
                        of the British Government to develop a position on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> at the Chequers meeting this coming
                        weekend.</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0144"/>
                    <p>8. The Germans are most sensitive to the possibility that British maneuvering
                        may leave them with a junior status. They were pleased with <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>'s assurances that the British
                        Government intends not to seek any “special position”, but rather to acquire
                        an equal footing with the Germans. The British concept of a comprehensive
                        nuclear force in which the mixed-manned surface ships constitute only one
                        element is disturbing to the Germans, but they have not yet firmed up a
                        position against it.</p>
                    <p>9. The loss of strength and confidence on the part of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is one of the most striking facts on the
                        German political scene. The SPD leaders are feeling their oats. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> talked with apparent great
                        confidence of the ability of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> to
                        capture the September election—or at least to reduce the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> total vote to the point where a grand
                        coalition could be put together. A good deal of active politicking is going
                        on. Strauss and his lieutenants are maneuvering—with not much subtlety—to
                        try to form a coalition of the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> with the
                            <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. Both <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and Erler assured me that they would have none of it.
                        The most likely result, they said, was an <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> coalition with the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>,
                        with the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> left out in the cold.</p>
                    <p>10. Apart from the fear of provoking a head-on confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, the most serious doubt with
                        regard to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> stems from continuing
                        misgivings regarding what the Germans understand to be the American
                        strategic concept. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> made much of
                        this in talking with me, indicating that he badly needed arguments to deal
                        with the Gaullist element in the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> who are
                        using this to undermine the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. I did not
                        undertake any serious educational effort on this question, since I assume
                        that von Hassel will be full of the subject on his return from Washington.
                        (Carstens tells me that Bonn has not yet received any detailed reporting
                        regarding the results of von Hassel's visit.) The French are obviously
                        playing all the changes on this issue with considerable effect. They argue
                        that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is prepared to fire
                        his force de frappe at the first Russian who sets foot on German territory,
                        whereas the US plans to let Germany be eaten up piece by piece before
                        resorting to a nuclear defense. Krone, who is a minion of Adenauer's, is
                        insisting that the whole <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> issue be held
                        up until there has been a full review of strategy by his National Security
                        Council (which is, for practical purposes, an honorific organization).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. We must design a specific plan of campaign to demonstrate to the Germans
                        and the other nations of NATO who are worried by French threats, that we are
                        making every possible effort to bring France into the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Much can be done by beating out a tattoo
                        on the “open door” and “vacant chair” themes. In addition, there needs to be
                        some early and conspicuous US conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. This should be held before <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">
                            <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0145"/>Harold Wilson</persName>'s
                        visit to the US to avoid the pattern of Nassau. One possibility would be for
                        me to try to see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, at the
                        President's direction, when I go to France the end of the month for the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Ministerial Meeting. The timing
                        would be about right—December 2 or 3 before <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> comes on the 7th. I mentioned this possibility to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> as something we might
                        consider, and he immediately brightened up and said, “very good idea.”</p>
                    <p>2. We should also explore the possibility of sending a high-powered briefing
                        team to Bonn to educate the Chancellor and a selected group of his
                        colleagues on the strategic concept. It is possible that this can be handled
                        effectively by von <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Hassel</persName> and
                        General Stettner, but they might find it useful to have some well-qualified
                        Americans reinforcing their own educational efforts.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">In a memorandum for the President's evening reading on

                        through the party and Bundestag but fears any substantial delay into the

                        left and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> came in to
                        talk about British balance of payments, but before he began there was some
                        further talk of this subject.</p>
                    <p>At Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s suggestion, Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> opened by reporting
                        briefly on his conversations in Berlin and Bonn. He said there was no doubt
                        that Chancellor Erhard was firmly behind the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and had the capacity to get it through the Bundestag.
                        Erhard faced no inter-Party problem since the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> had no intention of opposing him and Berlin Mayor Brandt
                        had assured Ball that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would support
                        the government on this matter. The <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> was
                        insignificant in this respect and was internally divided.</p>
                    <p>Erhard's problem was intra-Party within the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. It had been a tactical error to leave Adenauer as Party
                        Chairman. Adenauer now had two primary motivations: first, to get rid of
                        Erhard by any means, and second, to pursue his fascination with de Gaulle.
                        Around der Alte there was now grouped an odd combination of politicians on
                        the outs with the Chancellor: Strauss, Guttenberg, Gerstenmaier, et al. They
                        played with Adenauer and played on Party fears of antagonizing France or
                        destroying the Franco-German relationship.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we had a French problem which manifested itself through this
                        divisiveness within the German <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In Bonn, <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> had said
                        nothing different from what he had said to us here except that he was a bit
                        less forthcoming on the prospect of British mixed-manning in surface ships.
                        The British were now going to have a week-end at Chequers where for the
                        first time the chief members of the government would confront defense policy
                        problems together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought
                        it quite likely that they could work out an accommodation with us and the
                        Germans on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. It was too soon to be sure,
                        but he was hopeful.</p>
                    <p>There was now to be a sequence of consultations. He himself was going to
                        London and Paris, Wilson was coming here December 7–8 and the NATO
                        Ministerial meeting would follow on December 15. In the course of these
                        consultations, we might find it possible and needful to move fast for an
                        accommodation. However, this prospect required no decisions today, with one
                        exception: the need for contact with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> before Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> visited the United States in order to avoid any
                        impression of another Anglo-Saxon deal.</p>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0147"/>
                    <p>Ball made the point that in the eyes of London and Bonn, and also with regard
                        to our own public, it was important not to leave <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> free to create the impression that we were trying
                        to isolate the French or work against them. Therefore, we should prepare to
                        demonstrate our interest and concern for France by a public and serious
                        approach to De Gaulle—an approach which put to him the question: “What do
                        you want?” We should seriously make the point to him (in such fashion that
                        it was understood publicly): “We are not against you, but we don't know what
                        troubles you, and we don't have proposals from you.”</p>
                    <p>Ball emphasized that this demonstration should begin before <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s meeting with the President. He
                        recommended therefore (on the basis of discussion earlier in the morning
                        among members of the “Ball committee”) that we ask Jack McCloy to head a
                        small mission to talk with the French about nuclear relations. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> could go to Paris in the first part
                        of December when Ball would also be there (<gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>). He and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        could see Couve and then <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        could see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The Secretary
                        could follow on when he came over for the NATO meetings—December 15.</p>
                    <p>Since there was no prospect of a Johnson-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> meeting yet, these meetings could serve as a public
                        indication, a conspicuous gesture, that we were not trying to steam-roller
                        the French against <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and were
                        seriously interested in opening a dialogue if he chose to be
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether emissaries of this sort from him to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wouldn't just seem—as it did to
                        him—as if <persName>Johnson</persName> were just needling <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ball responded that last summer when he had gone as an “emissary” to discuss
                        the Southeast Asian question he had had a session with the General which was
                        frank and agreeable. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added: “and
                        sterile”.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then observed that even
                        so, it was useful to make this sort of gesture. We should not leave
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in a position to say
                        that we haven't tried to keep him in touch.</p>
                    <p>The President asked: “What was the gain in not waiting until the Secretary
                        reached Paris December 15?”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded that it was important to prevent press talk
                        about a repetition of the Nassau pattern, of the Nassau error.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked: “What was our own situation on the Hill?”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> responded that the situation
                        was tough, but unformed. Ball elaborated by saying that we had held off real
                        consultations with Congress deliberately waiting for the Europeans to work
                        out with us a concrete proposition. Congressional attitudes were therefore
                        rather negative on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and relevantly
                        uninformed about it. The doubts were uninformed doubts. We would have to go
                        to work on this but cannot do it <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"/>until we know precisely what it is we are going to want Congress to
                        accept.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that our
                        delegation to the NATO parliamentarians had a good briefing session in the
                        Department and had presented a strong statement at the parliamentarian
                        session. Senator Fulbright was particularly helpful.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether Congressional attitudes could be spelled out a
                        bit more. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then said that the
                        negativism came chiefly from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, not from
                        the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> broke in to say
                        that the situation really was as Bundy had put it. There was considerable
                        negativism but it had not hardened. It could be swung around if a good
                        presentation were possible after the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> visit.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that there were
                        two central questions on the Hill. First, do the Europeans really want this?
                        Second, does it really contribute to unity in the Alliance? Bundy noted that
                        there was a third question of equal, or more weight: “Are we letting go
                        control?”</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> observed that this
                        last question was the central issue. Now the general attitude in key
                        quarters on the Hill—the Joint Committee and also the Armed Services
                        Committee—was strongly negative, but no concerted effort had been made yet
                        to demonstrate that control was safe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that the key
                        Senators were Russell, Anderson and Pastore. He thought Pastore was ready to
                        be helpful and that Russell could swing Anderson if he himself were
                        convinced. This was crucial.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that opposition
                        from the Liberals could never be overcome but that this would not matter if
                        the Russells and the Andersons were persuaded.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>: “What about 'Scoop' (Jackson)?”
                        Bundy responded that he did not know what had been done with or about
                        Jackson.</p>
                    <p>Returning to his theme, Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that a key factor was jealousy between
                        the Foreign Relations Committee and the Joint Committee (which includes key
                        members of the Armed Services Committee). The more forthcoming Fulbright
                        seemed to be the more instinctive resistance would be found in the attitudes
                        of Russell, Anderson, et al.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded this phase of
                        the discussion by emphasizing that in any event we would lose the Liberals,
                        but what was crucial was not to lose Russell and Anderson. It would not be
                        easy to assure Russell's support, but he thought it could be done. This was
                        not at any rate <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0149"/>something we could
                        go to work on as yet. We had no proposition to put forward.</p>
                    <p>This phase of the meeting broke up at that point and then as Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> came in the President
                        returned to the question Ball had posed about <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>. The President said he was very dubious about this
                        and he'd like to have <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>'s view
                        of it. “I have the reaction,” the President observed, “that this sort of
                        emissary is just going to irritate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. He's after bigger fish. He wants to talk to me and he
                        wants to talk about things that are very important to him—assuming he wants
                        to talk at all.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that there was another
                        way to go about making the needed gesture: the President could call in
                        Alphand and give him a letter to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> asking the latter to let us know what he had to
                        propose and telling him we were continually interested in his views.</p>
                    <p>The President said that this appealed to him better than the <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> idea did. Turning to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> the President sketched the
                        background of the discussion and asked what <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought about <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>. The President repeated that his own instinct was
                        negative. “<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>”, he said,
                        “might well conclude that there was no government operating in the United
                        States, just bankers from New York. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> certainly was not going to succumb to a bunch of
                        errand boys. He might react the way President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would if De Gaulle started sending French bankers
                        over here as his personal emissary.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> broke in to
                        agree.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to say that if he were to send an emissary short of the
                        Secretary of State, it ought to be someone identified with public service in
                        the United States—not a banker, and ought to be someone more perceptive
                        about France and less identified with Germany than <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was wrong for that reason. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had an old wartime association with
                        De Gaullists but this did not interrupt the President's train of
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to say that <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s German connection was all wrong—to say nothing of
                        his banking connection—if anyone were to go it should be a Truman or an
                        Eisenhower type. He would far rather send Eisenhower than <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that that
                        would certainly flatter <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                        but that it was really the President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> wanted to see. Perhaps the thing to do at this stage
                        was merely to let <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> know that
                        the President intended to see him after Inaugural.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that in any
                        event there was no need to decide this matter today. One should take it back
                        and think it over and then come back to the President. The latter nodded and
                        turned to the question of the run on sterling which had brought Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> into the room.</p>

                    <p>At the end of November 1964, <persName corresp="#p_NRE1">Richard E.
                            Neustadt</persName> visited London at the request of the White House. In
                        a meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        on November 25, he stated that he had to come to avoid misunderstandings in
                        light of the 1962 Skybolt experience and stressed that his visit did not
                        represent a change in U.S. policy toward the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He added that discussions the previous day at the Defense
                        and Foreign Ministries on the subjects of mixed manning, Polaris submarines,
                        and surface forces indicated that the United States and the United Kingdom
                        were on a collision course, because the British seemed unable to appreciate
                        the political value of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> surface fleet
                        to the other NATO governments involved in the Paris discussions. He
                        concluded by noting that the Prime Minister could not expect the United
                        States to throw away 2 years' work. The Prime Minister replied that for the
                        United Kingdom there were two questions: 1)whether there should be a surface
                        fleet at all, and 2) whether the British should be in it, if there were one.
                        The United Kingdom believed the answer to the first was no and hoped to
                        present better alternatives. (Telegram 2565 from London, November 25;
                        Department of State, Central Files, DEF 12 NATO)</p>
                    <p>On November 26, Neustadt continued the discussion with Foreign Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>. Both men agreed
                        that one critical aspect of the problem was German involvement and the
                        avoidance of any appearance that the United States and the United Kingdom
                        were ganging up on Germany. Neustadt concluded that the discussion between
                        the United States and the new Labour government must begin from the
                        question: “What is the U.S. position on the surface fleet?” And in the
                        coming weeks, when Ball again visited Europe and Wilson went to Washington,
                        the United States must make clear that the principle of a surface-ship
                        component in any <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> was a sine qua non. (Telegram 2582 from

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Against my own expectations of two weeks ago, I am reaching the conclusion
                        that the U.S. should now arrange to let the MLF sink out of sight. Whether
                        this should be done quickly or slowly is an important tactical question, but
                        the overriding point which I wish to suggest in this tightly limited group
                        is that we should now ask the President for authority to work toward a
                        future in which the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> does not come into
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>I reach this conclusion because it seems increasingly clear that the costs of
                        success would be prohibitive. They would include at least the following:</p>
                    <p>1. A deeply reluctant and essentially unpersuaded Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>2. A Germany whose governing party was divided on this issue and whose
                        participation was ambiguous in meaning.</p>
                    <p>3. Additional strains on an Italian government which is weaker and not
                        stronger as a result of its last elections.</p>
                    <p>4. At least a temporary setback in efforts to limit the spread of nuclear
                        weapons by international agreement (those who believe strongly in such
                        agreements, in all countries, are skeptical of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>5. A protracted and difficult Congressional struggle in which we would be
                        largely deprived of the one decisive argument—that this arrangement is what
                        our major European partners really want.</p>
                    <p>6. A constitutional debate in NATO which, even if successful, would provide
                        justification for further Gaullist outrages against the organization.</p>
                    <p>7. A genuine and enduring blow to Franco-German relations which the Germans
                        will blame on us.</p>
                    <p>This is not an attractive prospect, and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is not worth it.</p>
                    <p>From my own conversations with the President, I am sure that he does not feel
                        the kind of personal Presidential engagement in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> itself which would make it difficult for him to strike out
                        on a new course if we can find one which seems better. I believe we can.</p>
                    <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0152"/>
                    <p>The fundamental requirement is that we should work in harmony with the
                        Germans, and my own judgment is that our first course should be to engage in
                        a most intimate and careful discussion with Erhard himself. When he chooses
                        to be, both his popularity and his position make him the undisputed
                        political leader of Germany. I myself believe that he would be glad to join
                        with the President of the United States in a radical defusing of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and a proposal for a completely fresh look
                        at the nuclear defenses of the Alliance, with an ostentatious inclusion of
                        France in this process of discussion.</p>
                    <p>As long as the German Chancellor is treated with care and dignity by the
                        American President, I believe we can meet the main purposes of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, at least in the short run, without paying
                        its heavy costs.</p>
                    <p>And even if a fresh look should lead nowhere over the next year or two we
                        would still be free to take new steps with the Germans if the situation then
                        demands it. I do not believe that any such steps need be worse than the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is today.</p>
                    <p>Since this question is fundamental to the Johnson/<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> talks, and since the President counts very heavily
                        upon the advice of the four of us, I hope very much that we may be able to
                        talk this matter out among ourselves over the weekend. I am calling Dean
                        Rusk separately to ask if he will propose times at his convenience for a
                        meeting under his chairmanship.</p>

                    <p>3262. For Secretary from Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> received me at noon today for what turned out to be a
                        very general, relaxed conversation of about one-half hour. I gave him the
                        President's message about Ball's visit and your desire to talk to him in
                        December on a number of <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0153"/>things, to
                        which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> indicated that he
                        would be glad to see you. I then told the General that while I had no
                        particular instructions or any special questions to take up with him, since
                        I was going home on a short visit I knew that his views in general on any
                        current questions were always of great interest in Washington. I mentioned
                        in this connection the general subject of U.S. relationship to Europe and
                        secondly anything that he might tell me in regard to French views on the
                        future organization of Europe.</p>
                    <p>1. Relationship of U.S. to Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> began by saying that in the last fifteen years there
                        had been a considerable change in the situation affecting Europe,
                        particularly in the immediacy and nature of the Soviet threat. He said that
                        whereas fifteen years ago many believed the threat to be real and immediate
                        it had now apparently diminished to the point where virtually no one in
                        Europe, and he ventured to say in the United States, believed in a Soviet
                        attack. Since the West was hardly prepared to try and reach Moscow by
                        military force and Soviet Union apparently was not prepared to inaugurate
                        military measures against Western Europe there seemed to be a very good
                        prospect for an extended period of peace. China was of course another
                        question but that would not materialize in the form of a threat for at least
                        fifty or a hundred years. For the immediate future it would appear that
                        peace was a very real possibility and that this, together with a revived
                        Western Europe, was one of the fundamental changes which had occurred
                        affecting relations with the U.S. For example, because of these two factors
                        he felt that European countries were again becoming “personalized” by which
                        he meant they were beginning to assert their own personality and in effect
                        to be seeking in one way or another their independence which could not but
                        affect their relations to the U.S. He added parenthetically he thought the
                        German interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was merely a
                        concealed measure of expressing their nationalism (this was only time during
                        conversation that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was mentioned).</p>
                    <p>2. Future European Developments. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> then turned to Europe and said that while an economic
                        Western Europe, at least of the Six, was a possibility—which would be put to
                        the test on agricultural policy by the end of this year—the next step which
                        would involve some form of political unity was a much more difficult task.
                        In fact there was no European policy at the present time since each European
                        country was following its own policy. For example Germany was preoccupied
                        with the question of reunification. Whether through some strong move against
                        Soviet Union as Foster Dulles had appeared to favor or through some
                        negotiated arrangement with the Soviets was as yet unclear. France was in no
                        hurry to see a reunified Germany since such a Germany would be a very
                        “disquieting” influence in Europe. The truth was however that Germany was
                        far from having a European policy at the present time and <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0154"/>in fact, for reasons of its own security,
                        did not object to being protected by the U.S. On the other hand, Holland,
                        for example, had in the past feared French domination and more recently that
                        of Germany. It had been her custom to turn originally to England for
                        protection, but with the diminishing weight of England she was not disposed
                        to turn to the U.S. to offset her fears.</p>
                    <p>There was another element to the problem while not directly a manifestation
                        of the inability of the European nations to evolve a common policy—this
                        attitude towards a so-called third world. Whereas France genuinely wished to
                        help these countries, some European countries (he did not specify which)
                        were not really anxious to help these third world countries to develop.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, after outlining the
                        objections that he saw towards the unity as against the unification of
                        Europe (a distinction he made in the French language) ended by saying that
                        frankly he did not see clearly the way to European unity at the present time
                        and left me with the impression that the attitude of Germany, because of its
                        preoccupation with reunification, was an insurmountable obstacle towards any
                        realization in the political field at the present time</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> at this point volunteered
                        that France had recognized China primarily in order to maintain contact. I
                        then inquired of the General whether or not he thought that in regard to
                        Vietnam the Chinese Communists, given their present ideological state of
                        mind, would ever be able to accept an agreement which would in effect cut
                        back Communist influence in Vietnam. De Gaulle stated that in Geneva in 1954
                        the ChiComs had not sought to proclaim Communism for all of Vietnam and he
                        saw no insuperable obstacle in the same formula being followed in any future
                        conference with Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I then mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> how
                        important Europe had become to the U.S. since the end of World War II,
                        mentioning briefly our previous one hundred eighty years of isolationism,
                        and that the signature of the NATO pact had been an enormous step for the
                        U.S. to take. I also told him that in view of the immense military presence
                        in Europe of the U.S. and the cost of such presence it was difficult, in the
                        words of the late President <hi rend="italic">Kennedy</hi>, to envisage a
                        military presence in Europe without a corresponding political presence. De
                        Gaulle replied in this connection that he thought that with the passage of
                        time and the further diminution of the Soviet threat, events in Eastern
                        Europe, particularly the loosening of the Soviet Bloc, it would become less
                        necessary for the U.S. to maintain large forces in Europe. He felt it would
                        be normal and logical at that unspecified time for the U.S. progressively to
                        reduce its forces in Europe. I told him I thought this would take a good
                        long time since even the slightest move in the direction of reduction of
                        forces caused great anxiety and cries of alarm from Germany, which he
                        admitted was the case.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0155"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that he had always
                        envisaged the continuance of the Alliance since he felt that France, no
                        matter what happened, because of the tradition of friendship and association
                        which existed between our two countries would wish to be allied with the
                        U.S. as indeed it would wish to be allied with England. He said however that
                        he felt that the present structure of NATO, which in effect, according to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, provided for American
                        control, was not satisfactory to France.</p>
                    <p>When I asked him what sort of reform the French had in mind he gave the
                        standard reply that they were not prepared to put forth any proposals at the
                        present time, but in reply to my question as to the time factor he indicated
                        that France would not be prepared to stay in the present NATO structure at
                        the expiration of the twenty years of the treaty, i.e., 1969.</p>
                    <p>I inquired how plans and other organizational matters, which we felt
                        necessary in time of peace, could be made without some comparable
                        organization to that existing in NATO, to which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> rather airily replied that general staff studies
                        could of course be made coordinating actions for use in time of war. I
                        mentioned at that point the importance of the nuclear problem and the great
                        changes that they had introduced in relations between states, as well as
                        military matters, but he showed no disposition to discuss this aspect of the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> sent his very
                        best regards to the President, whom he said had been given a very
                        exceptional mandate by the American people, which he said gave him a great
                        deal of opportunity for action in the coming months.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to Vietnam, since as he said I had brought it up, he wished to
                        express the very sincere hope not only for the sake of the people of the
                        world but also for the U.S. itself that we would find some means of
                        disengaging ourselves from this situation. He said the longer it was
                        postponed the worse it would get.</p>
                    <p>In general he said if he would dare to offer any advice he would say that
                        U.S. policy in the future should not be based upon general principles, or
                        particularly declaration of such principles, but should be supple, realistic
                        and reasonable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was in an unusually affable and easy frame of mind.
                        Little new emerged from the talk except that I found of considerable
                        interest his definite statement to me that France was in no hurry to see
                        German reunification and the related subject that Germany as a divided
                        country was one of the obstacles to any progress on European unity. The
                        second point of some interest was his definite statement that France would
                        not stay in NATO after 1969. While he did not so state, I could not avoid to
                        some extent the impression that he was thinking of a recasting of the
                        treaty, possibly along bilateral lines since he spoke in this connection of
                        France's need for alliances with the U.S. and England. In <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0156"/>actual fact, a treaty of collective
                        security would much more logically entail some form of collective
                        organization than would a bilateral treaty. This conversation seemed to me
                        to reveal very clearly the old fashioned and negative cast of de <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Gaulle</persName>'s thinking on foreign policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Following a speech on November 22, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had talked with Bohlen about
                            the U.S. reluctance to use nuclear weapons in defense of Europe. When
                            the Ambassador mentioned the thousands of American troops and tactical
                            nuclear weapons in Europe as an example of the U.S. commitment, the
                            President commented that tactical weapons might be used, but that no one
                            could expect the United States to risk its cities by using strategic
                            nuclear weapons. (Telegram 3167 from Paris, November 23; ibid., DEF 1

                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> in the Cabinet Room
                        at 10 Downing Street. He was accompanied by the Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Patrick Gordon Walker</persName> (who left mid-way in
                        the meeting), and his Private Secretary Oliver Wright. I was accompanied by

                        summarizing the conversations in which he and I had just engaged.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had met for about an hour at
                            noon with <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> and
                            Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Denis Healey</persName> and
                            members of his staff to discuss the military aspects of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The talks focused on mixed manning and
                            the British desire for a clear U.S. statement about its control of
                            nuclear weapons. Ball summarized the conversation in Secun 2 from Paris,
                            December 2. (Ibid., Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>))</note> He reported my statement, in reply to his
                        query, that the British could not expect the United States to <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0157"/>match the Polaris submarines to be

                    <p>The Foreign Secretary then reported that I had indicated to him that we were
                        not doctrinaire in our approach to the multilateral nuclear force but we
                        were determined that any ideas for accommodation must not compromise what we
                        considered the basic objectives of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.
                        Moreover, any changes must be acceptable to other participants. He said he
                        had been about to ask me about the US veto when we had broken up our meeting
                        in order to come to the Prime Minister's office.</p>
                    <p>I responded to his comment about the veto by recalling my recent
                        conversations with the Germans at the fourth German-American conference in
                        Berlin on November 14. I had been asked by the German participants to state
                        the US position with regard to a possible European deterrent.</p>
                    <p>I had replied to this query by asking what was meant by a “European
                        deterrent.” If it meant an offer by France to use the force de frappe in the
                        defense of Europe the effect would be merely to transfer European reliance
                        from Paris to Washington [sic]. In that event the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would, of course, have to re-examine its military relations
                        with Europe. The Germans had been unanimous in saying that they would never
                        be in favor of a European deterrent on these terms. The Prime Minister
                        interjected, “nor would we.”</p>
                    <p>I had then said that if we were talking about a European deterrent that might
                        emerge as a result of the political unification of Europe that which brought
                        about the creation of a competent executive authority to which the European
                        nations had been willing to delegate the authority to make the life or death
                        decision involved in the use of atomic power then this would have created a
                        new situation which we would have to examine. But that time was obviously
                        far in the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> interjected at this point to
                        inquire whether we meant an executive which was established prior to actual
                        political unification. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                        said that this was a hard point to define.</p>
                    <p>I said that what we should tell the Europeans was, “You build a united Europe
                        with a competent executive and we will look at the situation after you are
                        finished”. But we were certainly not ready to agree now to relinquish our
                        veto even if they succeeded.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister interjected to say that any language on this point in
                        any agreement regarding a multilateral force would require very careful
                        drafting. I agreed but added that we were prepared to develop language on
                        this subject under which the United Kingdom would, in <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0158"/>effect, have the right to veto any action
                        by the US in relinquishing its own veto.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked if we would say this publicly, and asked if I were
                        familiar with his recent speech in Parliament on the multilateral
                            force.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s speech to Parliament, November
                            23, see House of Commons, Parliamentary Debates, Fifth Series, vol. 702,
                            cols. 930 ff.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I answered that I was very familiar with his speech. We had been frankly
                        disturbed by the speech and particularly by his reference to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a “divisive force in Europe”.</p>
                    <p>This was the kind of language that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was using—not the kind of language we expected from
                        the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister looked momentarily embarrassed but sought to explain his
                        statement. He was assisted by Gordon Walker who observed that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had been frequently referred to as a
                        “divisive force” during the election campaign. The Prime Minister added that
                        if I wanted to see a real Gaullist speech I should read the one delivered in
                        Parliament by Peter Thorneycroft.<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">For text of

                    </p>
                    <p>It was, he said, unforgivable for the Tories to insist on a debate on the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> on the eve of an important
                        negotiating session with the United States. It made it all the more
                        difficult for the Labor Party because the Conservatives threatened to force
                        the issue to a vote.</p>
                    <p>The Tories, he insisted, had introduced the Nassau issue into the election
                        campaign by posing as the great defenders of the “supreme national
                        emergency” clause. He himself felt this was counter to President Kennedy's
                        view of Nassau, which stressed the multilateral aspect of that
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>He said he cited this as an important factor in political terms because it
                        formed the background for his handling of the debate in Parliament on the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The actual details of <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>'s discussions in Washington
                        in October had not been reported to anyone but the Prime Minister and the
                        Defense Minister. Therefore, he could not bring the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question into the Cabinet until after the Chequers meeting.
                        In actual fact he did not go to the Cabinet until last Thursday on this
                        matter. He had succeeded in forcing the issue through—and, he said with
                        considerable emphasis, he had taken his political life in his hands when he
                        had talked about the possible disposition of Polaris submarines in the
                        debate in Commons.</p>
                    <p>He had done all this, he said, because he fully realized that considerable
                        momentum had built up since Nassau. He, therefore, had gone far in <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0159"/>committing himself on putting the
                        Polaris submarines into a multilateral force in spite of his earlier
                        election statement.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then suddenly shifted the basis for his defense of his
                        Parliamentary statement by saying that he probably had more accurately
                        expressed the idea of “divisive” in his Guildhall speech. What he meant by
                        “divisive” was a “dispersion” or “dissipation” of effort within the Alliance
                        as a result of the undertaking to construct a wholly new weapons system.</p>
                    <p>At this point I said that he might be interested in the considerations that
                        were influencing the present attitude of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Discussion of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had
                        proceeded for a long time. We had worked with other nations in Paris for
                        many months. We had examined with great care various alternative schemes.
                        The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> seemed to offer the best
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>It was admittedly somewhat complicated but that resulted from the fact that
                        we had to deal with the political structure of the world as it was, and that
                        structure consisted of a number of nation states.</p>
                    <p>In view of this fact there were only two ways to approach the problem of
                        nuclear management. We could approach it on a collective basis or by
                        creating a number of individual national deterrents. The latter course held
                        great dangers.</p>
                    <p>We were prepared to work with <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> on trying
                        to find accommodations for its problems. However, we were not prepared to do
                        so at the expense of compromising our objectives. Our principal objectives
                        were to tie Germany closer to the West, to strengthen Atlantic unity and to
                        discourage nuclear proliferation by providing nonnuclear nations an
                        opportunity to participate in the ownership, management, and control of
                        nuclear weapons. Moreover, any adjustments of the basic plan must, of
                        course, be acceptable to the other interested nations.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then asked how we proposed to move the discussion toward
                        some agreed basis. I said that we hoped to be able to find a range of
                        solutions for our mutual problems when we meet next week in Washington. We
                        should not, however, continue too long with bilateral discussion. Early in
                        January, perhaps beginning sometime the week of the 3rd, we might find it
                        useful to have a multilateral meeting at the ministerial level. I though
                        that at least five nations should be asked to attend such a meeting—the US,
                        the UK, the Germans, the Italians and the Dutch.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked if such a multilateral meeting would be held under
                        an “umbrella” such as NATO. I replied that in my view this would not be very
                        practicable. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> then
                        chimed in to say that a NATO umbrella would involve too many people and
                        create too many other difficulties.</p>
                    <p>There was a brief discussion as to a possible site for a meeting. I suggested
                        Switzerland or perhaps The Hague, but said this was something <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0160"/>we could discuss in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> pointed out to the Prime
                        Minister that during the first part of January he would be in the midst of
                        his electoral campaign. The Prime Minister instantly responded that this was
                        no problem since Healey could be the representative for the British
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then stated that he was in thorough accord with the idea
                        of a ministerial meeting in early January, and stated quite emphatically
                        that we could not continue to discuss the matter very much longer on a
                        bilateral basis. He then noted that he might be in the United States again
                        late in January at the UN General Assembly. He would be prepared to go to
                        Washington for a formal or informal visit, depending on which appeared more
                        useful at the time. I remarked that this might be quite helpful but that we
                        could not delay progress until the latter part of January.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> then said that he would
                        be seeing the German Foreign Minister on December 11 and that he would see
                        Spaak before next week. He also mentioned that he planned to see Saragat
                        again. He added that he doubted that there could be useful discussion of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> at the NATO Ministerial meeting.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the Congo.]</p>
                    <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> left.
                        Immediately the Prime Minister became noticeably more relaxed and candid. He
                        gave the impression of a man who knew what he wanted but was on guard in the
                        presence of his own Cabinet colleagues.</p>
                    <p>I said that I thought it might be helpful to describe to him the prevailing
                        atmosphere in Washington. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was approaching his pending visit as a meeting
                        between friends who had problems to be worked out together. I said that I
                        mentioned this because I was aware of a school of thought in London which
                        held that the only way to succeed with the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        Administration was through hard bargaining.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister interjected to say that he wished to get ahead with the
                        problem but he did not feel that this was a situation in which there could
                        be no “trade”—in the sense of an “exchange” of one point for another.</p>
                    <p>I said that we were not thinking in terms of haggling or selling carpets.
                        Everyone was well disposed toward the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> government and anxious to get off to a good
                        beginning. But, I said, we must view these talks as a situation in which
                        each side says “My problem is such and such, your problem is such and such
                        and we must try to find a solution together.” With this attitude we stood a
                        good chance of succeeding.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he faced political problems—both domestic, and
                        in the field of foreign affairs. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had the great advantage of having “smashed” the
                        opposition. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> was faced with the
                        possibility of another election—perhaps in the spring—in <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0161"/>which the defense issue would be a key
                        element. At the moment it was popular to take the Gaullist line in Britain.
                        Therefore, he said, “I must come back from Washington in a very strong
                        position, not perhaps next week but at least at the end of January.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then picked up a clipping from the London Times of
                        Saturday, November 28, regarding my trip to London. He read various portions
                        of it. He noted that it said: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is well acquainted with the latest Presidential
                        approach to the nuclear proposals.” Looking across the table he said, “I
                        agree with that statement.” He said that the article also indicated that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was firmly
                        committed to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and he believed that
                        too.</p>
                    <p>He said furthermore that the United Kingdom was not against a multilateral
                        force. “We are,” he said, “committed to that part of the Nassau agreement
                        which deals with the inclusion of national forces in a multilateral force
                        but we are against the other part.”</p>
                    <p>Continuing further he said that he was greatly interested by one statement in
                        the article which said that “Any proposal designed to perpetuate national
                        control …will be unacceptable.” He asked me if that was an accurate
                        statement of the United States point of view.</p>
                    <p>I said that it was not a very accurate statement of our present thinking.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister replied, “That is too bad. I had hoped that it was.” I
                        then explained to him that the decision to give up the British national
                        deterrent was a national decision which only the British could make. We were
                        hardly in position to insist that the British give up their deterrent since
                        we had originally worked with them in developing it. And at Nassau had
                        ratified its extension into the next generation of weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then said “Suppose we came to Washington with a fall-back
                        proposal which involved our keeping our own Polaris but giving in to the
                        mixed manned surface fleet?”</p>
                    <p>I replied that would be fine with us.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister, grinning like a fox, then said, “Ah, you agree with Tory
                        policy but not with Labor policy. You would prefer that we would all go back
                        to Nassau.”</p>
                    <p>I said that at Nassau the UKG had indicated that it did not plan to
                        participate in the mixed manned force but it had committed itself to giving
                        that force “a fair wind”. I recognized that if the United Kingdom now
                        decided to turn over its Polaris submarines irrevocably to an Atlantic
                        nuclear force, we would see benefits in that course. By divesting itself of
                        nuclear weapons the <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> might help to arrest
                        the present disturbing trend toward proliferation—a trend that had been
                        given a new impetus by the recent Chinese explosion.</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>I said that we could explore further in Washington whether it was at all
                        feasible for us to go on record as encouraging the British relinquishment of
                        its national nuclear system, if that would be useful to the Prime Minister
                        in facilitating British participation in the mixed manned force. However,
                        this would require further thought and I did not wish to express a definite
                        view at this time. It should be clear however, I added, that if we were
                        going to succeed in developing an arrangement in Washington it would have to
                        provide for some British participation in the mixed manned surface
                        fleet.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that during the election campaign the Tories had made
                        a great point of saying that the Labor government would turn over the
                        defense of the United Kingdom to the Americans. We would recognize that
                        there were anti-American elements both in the Tory Party and the Labor
                        Party. These elements did not control either party—particularly the Labor
                        Party. However, he had to face the fact that merely to hand over the British
                        Polaris submarines on a non-returnable basis could well be political
                        suicide.</p>

                        unification. In my meeting today with FonMin Schroeder on a variety of
                        subjects I expressed appreciation for the fact that the Germans had, in
                        presenting their grain price proposals in Brussels, linked them to the
                        success of the Kennedy Round, particularly the agricultural negotiations. I
                        said that I wished to make clear, however, that we considered the grain
                        price suggested by the Germans, i.e., 440 DM per ton, too high—indeed, we
                        considered 425 DM proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> as being too high. We <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0163"/>hoped the Germans would be flexible in their negotiations
                        on this point. There was a grave danger that even at the Mansholt levels
                        there would be such an increase in grain production within the Common Market
                        that the exports of the US and other outside suppliers would be
                        jeopardized.</p>

                    <p>We had another meeting with the President at 3 p.m.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">On December 5, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NRE1">Neustadt</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had met with the President for 2 hours beginning at
                            1:15 p.m. Bruce summarized the meeting as follows: “In the course of our
                            Presidential interview, no definite commitment was made on the cardinal
                            point; that is whether <persName>Johnson</persName> would tell <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> that British participation in a
                            mixed-manned surface ship force was a sine qua non to his acceptance of
                            any British proposals. I surmise he may state this in his talks on
                            Monday, but is evidently anxious to give further thought to it, before
                            reaching such an irrevocable decision. We were frank in pointing out
                            that there was no support in any party in Britain for our conception; it
                            was only likely to be agreed as an element in a package deal.”
                            (Ibid.)</note> It was a Loulou. <persName>Johnson</persName> said he had
                        found no support whatever for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> either
                        abroad or at home. It would command only a minority of votes in the Senate.
                        Was he to be put in the position of Woodrow Wilson, and discover that a
                        treaty he had advocated was repudiated by the Congress? In short, he did not
                        intend to have a showdown with Wilson on this. Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, that marvelous fellow, talked in
                        contrary advocacy; <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> did
                        likewise. George is out on a limb, which the President may saw off.
                        Unfortunately, Acheson was not there. I contributed my mite, acknowledging
                        an ignorance of Congressional reactions, but attempting to place the
                        controversy on an Atlantic plane. Johnson, from time to time, telling Texan
                        or other stories, picturesque in language, confused us as to how he might
                        negotiate. There were many divagations in his remarks from the subject at
                        issue. At one point, directing his attention to me, he said he had read in
                        the New York Times an article by Tad Szulc saying I intended to <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0164"/>retire; “What was that nonsense? Would I
                        not remain?”—the post was unspecified. Those present were slightly
                        flabbergasted, as was I. I answered that I had not inspired such articles,
                        but for the past two years had submitted my resignation on each January 1st.
                        The President said he thought that inadmissible, and would I stay? I replied
                        by suggesting we discuss the affair in private. This was agreeable to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Then we continued. What he will say to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> tomorrow is wrapped in mystery. Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, just arrived from New York, was
                        projected into the affray. In a cautious, somewhat equivocal fashion, he
                        sponsored a postponement of decision. I was disappointed, for I do not know
                        where we stand.</p>

                    <p>1. You asked yesterday why President Kennedy was tentative and careful about
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. It was rightly pointed out that
                        there were different reasons at different times, but in the last half of
                        1963 the reasons were, I think, dominated by his feeling that if he could
                        only get the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> by major and intense U.S.
                        pressure, it was not worth it. His exact reasoning I do not know, but I do
                        know that he reacted very strongly and affirmatively to a memorandum which I
                        sent him on June 15, 1963 (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">For text, see

                        it may be worth your attention, and I attach it.</p>
                    <p>2. I do this partly because I feel that we have not given you a full and fair
                        statement of the case against pressing hard now for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. I myself do come out on the side of going
                        ahead very hard with Wilson <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>himself, but you are entitled to know that there is another side of the
                        case, and it would go something like this:</p>
                    <p>(1) The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or AMF will make very heavy
                        demands on direct Presidential leadership, and there are better things for
                        the President to do. It is all very well to talk of Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> converting the Senate, but the
                        man who will really have to do it is the President.</p>
                    <p>(2) The new force, even though wider and better than the old <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, will have many opponents, and their voices
                        will be heard, whatever specific leaders of governments may say. The most
                        important of them are as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">France</hi>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s hostility is fixed
                        and strongly supported by all French Gaullists. Tactically, the violence of
                        French feeling can probably be somewhat moderated if you visit Paris and
                        reason with him, but the underlying hostility of France will remain. It is
                        true that the French propaganda now is preventive in purpose, but it will
                        continue at least until ratification in all countries. The French will
                        charge us with dividing the Alliance and blocking the future of Europe, and
                        many who do not support de Gaulle will believe them. The Germans will be
                        split by this French pressure and they, too, will show some tendency to
                        blame us.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The Soviet Union</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets already charge that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is a
                        reopening of cold war hostility. Most of their opposition I consider
                        tactical, but it is built on their genuine fear of Germany, and it strikes a
                        lot of resonance among peace lovers and liberals in all countries.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Most professional military</hi> men are cool at best,
                        and many are openly opposed. Lemnitzer is warning against this enterprise as
                        divisive within the Alliance. Norstad is publicly against it. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will be loyal but probably not
                        enthusiastic. General Eisenhower may not be any better than neutral and
                        could be opposed.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">American commentators</hi> like Lippmann and George
                        Kennan are violently opposed. Lippmann believes that there is no serious
                        support for this force anywhere except among a few faddists in the State
                        Department. He will shortly come back from Europe saying that his travels
                        have confirmed this impression. (Walter, more than most, sees only what he
                        wishes to see in nuclear matters.)</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">The Joint Committees and the Armed Services
                            Committee</hi> are very wary of any treaty which seems to affect U.S.
                        nuclear power and still more wary of any amendment of the McMahon Act.
                        Holifield has publicly stated his opposition, but this is of course less
                        important than what Russell and Anderson decide.</p>
                    <p>F. Hubert <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> summarizes <hi rend="italic">Senatorial</hi> sentiment as strongly opposed and on many
                        grounds. While we have never made a major <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0166"/>Administration effort with the Senators, there are a large
                        number who have informed themselves reasonably well, and I think it is fair
                        to say that right now I know of not one hardened supporter, while there are
                        many skeptics and many outright opponents. Hubert says that when Livingston
                        Merchant gave informal <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> briefings on the
                        Hill last year the surface response was polite, but the real reaction was
                        negative.</p>
                    <p>3. All this means that we will have a great effort of political education
                        ahead of us even after we have gone past Wilson and worked out a genuine
                        multilateral agreement, perhaps in January or February. President Kennedy
                        used to say that we would do this only if the Europeans really wanted it.
                        Given the level of European skepticism, we will have to make an entirely
                        different case based on our own judgment that this is what the whole
                        Atlantic Community now requires if it is not to break apart and if Germany
                        is not to be tempted into another disastrous national rearmament.
                        (Incidentally, all those in America who fear the Germans will be hostile—as
                        many of them are already.)</p>
                    <p>4. The devil's advocate might continue by saying that the choice this week is
                        not at all as black and white as men like Acheson say. Even if Wilson says
                        “yes” there will be further problems of timing and tactics which may give
                        you later moments of choice. And if he refuses to say “yes” at this stage,
                        there is still quite a political charade to be played out.</p>
                    <p>5. The devil's advocate would argue that even on this basis we can save most
                        of our real interests—though not the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>6. The Germans will still need us as friends and we will need them. This
                        basic common interest is exemplified in the enormous U.S. nuclear and
                        conventional forces now in Germany, and most of those forces will still be
                        there, <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or no <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, in the coming years.</p>
                    <p>7. We can continue to prevent de Gaulle from dominating Europe even without
                        an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—the Europeans themselves have no
                        desire to follow him. His nuclear force is not a big magnet. The number of
                        Germans who really tie their fate to France as against the U.S. is
                        ridiculously small. The German politicians who favor France today would be
                        the first to come to Washington if they ever came to power.</p>
                    <p>8. We can enlarge political and nuclear consultation even without an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. It is true that this is an inferior way of
                        doing it, but if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is not destroyed by
                        us but by circumstances, new consultative procedures could usefully show our
                        good will.</p>
                    <p>9. We can leave the British Polaris problem unsettled and let London stew in
                        its own juice and thus show that we are true to our doctrine that any new
                        arrangement must take full account of the needs of the Germans.</p>
                    <p>10. We can also say clearly that we will go right back to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—and perhaps even to more drastic
                        measures—if the Cold War heats up again (it is worth remembering that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was generated in 1960–62, a <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0167"/>period of heavy and active Soviet
                        pressure on Berlin; the absence of that pressure is a major part of our
                        present tactical problem).</p>
                    <p>11. In sum, the devil's advocate would state your choices this way:</p>
                    <p>(1) If you go full steam ahead, you face a long, hard political fight, a
                        major confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                        and a possibility of defeat or delay which would gravely damage the prestige
                        of the President.</p>
                    <p>(2) If you go half steam ahead, there will probably be no <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but it will not be your fault alone. You
                        will have kept the letter and spirit of the Kennedy readiness to move if the
                        Europeans wanted it. There will be trouble with the Germans, but nothing
                        unmanageable. There will be plenty of opportunities for debate, discussion
                        and delay, and for gradual and ceremonial burial. Your wisdom, caution and
                        good judgment will have the praise of liberals, of military men, of the
                        British, of the French, and of many Germans—and you will have freedom to
                        make a different choice later if you wish.</p>

                    <p>I talked to the President on the telephone from my office to his at 1:30, and
                        he gave me the following debriefing of his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> between 11:30 and 1:00
                            today.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">For another account of this meeting,

                            conversations with the President on questions of mutual concern.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President said that the conversation began with a discussion of the
                        British and American elections. The President pointed out to the Prime
                        Minister that there were a lot of problems which did not show in the U.S.
                        returns, especially with respect to international affairs. He said that our
                        folks were damned tired of being told that it was their business to solve
                        all the world's problems and do so mainly alone, and that he was very wary
                        of taking any tall dives that might get him into the situation Roosevelt got
                        into in 1937.</p>
                    <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>
                    <p>Against this background, the President spoke frankly but kindly to the Prime
                        Minister about the troubles which the latter had already given the
                        President. He pointed out that the impression which had been created by the
                        British budget, with its heavy emphasis on social security, and the
                        pressures created against the pound had combined to make the President's own
                        budgeting process very difficult. He had originally planned on a budget of
                        $107 or $108 billion and now he was forced to think in terms of $101–$102,
                        which would make it very difficult to carry out the programs he wanted. This
                        British decision had shaken us up some.</p>
                    <p>The President said the second thing which had given him trouble was the
                        monetary action of the British Government. The British had made trouble for
                        themselves and for others by sounding as if they did not believe in the
                        instrument of the bank rate and then using it very heavily and suddenly.</p>
                    <p>The third point the President made was that the British economic problem was
                        in no sense over, and we might well expect a good deal of trouble in the
                        next 60 to 90 days and that problems for the pound would also be problems
                        for the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President talked to the Prime Minister about the difficulties
                        created by his speech on Atlantic nuclear defense in the House of
                        Commons.</p>
                    <p>By that time, the President said, the Prime Minister was almost on the ropes.
                        The Prime Minister said that on the Atlantic nuclear force he laid the blame
                        on Flora Lewis. (Later on in the day the President described this episode to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> by saying, “He chased Flora Lewis
                        all around the room.”)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister knew that this episode had created a serious episode and
                        he wanted us to know that he had not said no to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> but only to a force without a US veto. On the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, he had said maybe. (Later the President
                        told us this reminded him of the girl who, when she said maybe, really meant
                        yes, and the President said he was not in a position now to accept the
                        bargain.) The President reminded the Prime Minister of the difficulties Sir
                        Alec Douglas-Home had given him on commenting on Cuban busses from the White
                        House steps. This time the Prime Minister had given him trouble ten days
                        before the visit. The Prime Minister said he felt very sorry—that he had
                        meant to give a very preliminary and general discussion as the President did
                        at Georgetown.</p>
                    <p>The President returned to the Atlantic nuclear problem and said he himself
                        would not take any adamant position and had no intention of forcing the
                        matter now. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] We had been over there twice now in his lifetime and
                        we did not want to have to do it again. He said that the best people in his
                        government had worked on this, both under President Kennedy and under him,
                        and they just did <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0169"/>not see any other
                        way of doing it than the way that was now before us. The President told the
                        Prime Minister that a stitch in time saves nine, and that if we couldn't
                        solve this problem and tie the Germans in, [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>]. The Germans had made rockets for the
                        U.S. and the British, which proved they had brains, and they lent a lot of
                        money to the UK, which showed that they had money. All they needed now was
                        will, and that was what we had to prevent, so that we should all get
                        together and work this thing out.</p>
                    <p>Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would show the Prime
                        Minister how to reduce his force from 5 submarines to 3, and take the money
                        and men he had saved, and put the men on the surface ships. The President
                        knew the Prime Minister wanted to keep our finger on the trigger, and we
                        want exactly the same thing; the object was to keep the Germans with us and
                        keep their hand off the trigger. The President repeated that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the other Americans could
                        show the British how to join in on this without any real trouble, and with
                        no cost.</p>
                    <p>Earlier, in the presence of the Prime Minister and Sir Burke Trend, the
                        President had debriefed to Trend and me by saying many of the same things.
                        He pointed out in that meeting that he had spoken of Erhard's problems. (He
                        later told <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that the Prime Minister had been
                        low on Erhard and high on Willy Brandt.)</p>
                    <p>The two had agreed that Adenauer was no help. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> remarked that while he had agreed on the fact that
                        the Germans presented a real problem, he had not got to specifics. The
                        President said that he had described all his best advisers as men with the
                        temperament of Rhodes Scholars, dangerously sympathetic to the UK, and had
                        made it clear that while he was “not going to put his feet in concrete” or
                        get the Prime Minister's feet in concrete, he did very much hope that we
                        could reason it out together. In this meeting he put his point about the
                        Germans by saying that he had just won an election by preaching against
                        discrimination in the United States, and he could not now preach in favor of
                        discrimination in international affairs.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he and the Prime Minister had agreed to have a
                        private talk on monetary matters with experts from both sides, and he asked
                        me to arrange a meeting at which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> and Chairman Ackley would be present at 4:45. This I
                        later did.</p>

                    <p>At 3:45 p.m., following a luncheon at the British Embassy, the U.S. and
                        British Foreign and Defense Ministers began a general discussion of defense
                        problems with the British reporting the very serious economic pressure
                        confronting them and the need to cut back their worldwide commitments. They
                        submitted a paper entitled “Atlantic Nuclear Force, Outline of Her Majesty's
                        Government's Proposal,” subsequently circulated to the other NATO members,
                        which committed British strategic nuclear forces to a new Atlantic nuclear
                        force with the exception of certain bombers, included four Polaris
                        submarines, acceded to the concept of German equality in the force, and
                        agreed to try mixed-manning for some of the bombers. A memorandum of the

                    <p>(The principals were absent when the meeting began. The President and the
                        Prime Minister joined the group at 6:10 p.m.)</p>
                    <p>In the absence of the principals Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by turning to the subject of
                        Minutemen and the problems of mixed-manning them. He said many looked across
                        the Pacific and therefore NATO should not become involved.</p>
                    <p>British Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>
                        observed that such a force, at best, would only be a fraction of the U.S.
                        total capacity. And <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                        added that one wing of mixed-manned Minutemen could not control the
                        remainder.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he did not believe
                        the Germans had an interest in participating in a mixed-manned weapons setup
                        in continental U.S. They wanted something in the European area and not
                        anything clearly in the physical control of the U.S. Psychologically, that
                        was a most important factor.</p>
                    <p>Replying, <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said the Dutch and
                        the Norwegians preferred to be mixed up with the U.S., and it was his
                        understanding that the German Socialists wanted this, too. Those who
                        insisted on having the weapons in Europe were generally looking to the
                        ultimate release of a U.S. veto.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said this was a
                        difficult problem. Not only was mixed-manning with greater weapons
                        dangerous. The fact was that the U.S. was redesigning the Minuteman and
                        wanted to keep this fact from the USSR. With mixed-manning, it would be
                        difficult to keep. This information was under tight control.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> granted that the
                        Secretary's argument on security was powerful, and then turned to the
                        subject of equality with the Germans. <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0172"/>He asserted that essentially equality was control and not
                        in the manning arrangements. The system of vetoes proposed by the British
                        took this into account.</p>
                    <p>Healey then asked what the U.S. had in mind at Nassau when it agreed to
                        assign part of its strategic forces under paragraph 6<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">For text of the Nassau communique, December 21, 1962,
                            see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962, pp.
                            635–637.</note> and include Polaris submarines in the multilateral
                        force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> assumed that the
                        undertakings involved a mixed-manned seaborne force in which British and
                        U.S. Polarises would be included.</p>
                    <p>Healey observed that the details were not spelled out in the communique, and
                        as he read the agreement, it called for equal participation of U.S. and UK
                        forces without reference to mixed-manning.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that the British
                        Government never agreed to join the mixed-manned force but it had clearly
                        agreed to give that concept a free wind.</p>
                    <p>This gave <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> the opportunity to
                        talk about Nassau and particularly about the performance of the Tory
                        leaders. He said the Labor Government was just catching up with the Nassau
                        record, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. He
                        also thought it was unfortunate that the points of agreement at the meeting
                        were not laid down more specifically. It was unclear to Healey how the
                        national and mixed-manning concepts could have become so confused.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that the
                        terminology was straightened out after Nassau and the terms “multilateral”
                        and “multinational” were used to define the separate concepts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added, however, the presumption
                        always was that the seaborne force would be mixed-manned.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then asked if the British
                        contributed their Polaris submarines and V-bombers to the force, what would
                        the U.S. contribution consist of.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was entirely
                        possible to think about putting in B–47s, 52s and 58s, although he wanted to
                        ponder this more carefully and know more about mix-manning bombers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> commented that the NATO
                        working group had already said that the mixed-manned bombers were
                        feasible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then remarked that the real
                        aim was to produce a control system satisfactory to the non-nuclear powers
                        and bring them into the operation so that they would familiarize themselves
                        with the nature and the problems of the strategic forces. Physical contact
                        with missiles alone did not seem to produce the necessary
                        understanding—witness the example of the French. It was important to get
                        down to the hard problems of nuclear strategy before this understanding was
                        achieved. In <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0173"/>other words, the most
                        important point of the exercise was its educational value. And <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> doubted that its effectiveness was
                        determined by the existence of mixed-manned surface ships. As far as he
                        could tell, the power of the atom could even be learned from Pershings.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> disagreed and said
                        the problem was far bigger. Moreover, there was a German public to be
                        considered.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on this same point, Healey wondered how much of the German problem
                        was related to a misunderstanding of the U.S. willingness to drop its veto.
                        He said he thought the Germans saw the mixed-manned fleet as one which the
                        German element could come to dominate. Therefore, they were not prepared to
                        accept anything less promising. By the same token, the British felt the
                        persistence of the U.S. veto was an important factor and this had to be made
                        clear to the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he could not
                        believe there was such a misunderstanding. The Germans knew the U.S. veto
                        was a fact of life. And as for its relinquishment, he felt certain that they
                        understood this could only be considered when and if Europe was unified
                        under a single executive. Then there clearly would be a new situation and
                        all would be obliged to take a new look at the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he had told Von
                        Hassel quite categorically that the U.S. did not intend to give up the veto.
                        Others could not trigger SAC. The U.S. could not be part of a force in which
                        it did not have a veto.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> insisted this was precisely
                        the problem. The Germans saw in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        statements reason to believe they might be on their way to a European
                        deterrent without U.S. interference. He therefore felt strongly that the
                        U.S. position in this matter had to be made as clear to the Germans as it
                        had already been made to the UK and the USSR.</p>
                    <p>Although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asserted the Germans
                        understood this, <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> insisted that
                        the European unification formula could spell the end of non-proliferation.
                        Nuclear weapons then would be turned over under certain circumstances to
                        present non-nuclear European powers. And the concept of a unified Europe was
                        in itself an equivocation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he could not see the British point because in his
                        mind he could not envisage a Europe that did not at least have a France
                        and/or a Britain.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then went back to the mixed-manned surface force with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> contending that the
                        Germans saw in this element a half-way measure to a European force without a
                        U.S. veto.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that Great
                        Britain would in any event have its veto, <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> insisted there was a point beyond which one nation
                        could not hold out against the others. Greater protection was needed and
                        this would have to be a clear U.S. statement of its intention to retain its
                        veto.</p>
                    <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0174"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the U.S. did not
                        want to take a position which said the U.S. would not give up its veto under
                        any circumstances and thereby play right into the hands of the Gaullists.
                        And <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> replied, “But if
                        you don't, you raise hopes that should not have been raised.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wondered which
                        Germans the British were talking about. Responsible German leaders (e.g. Von
                        Hassel) with whom he talked clearly understood that the U.S. was not going
                        to give up the veto and accepted this. The Secretary of State added that the
                        Germans in fact had said quite frankly they saw the multilateral force as an
                        element tying the U.S. more closely to Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said there were at least two
                        forces in Germany—those who wanted closer ties with the U.S. and those who
                        wanted to separate Europe from the U.S. for whatever reasons. And the latter
                        saw in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> potential bargaining power
                        for themselves in bargaining with the USSR.</p>
                    <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> denied this
                        was a position of responsible Germans, <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> retorted that one German who felt this way was
                        Hallstein, who saw the multilateral force as the beginning of a European
                        force which in turn would be an important element of a politically unified
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought it would be
                        disastrous to let the impression get around that the Anglo-Saxons were
                        trying to prevent a political Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> said he could see the
                        problem of wanting to hedge the veto commitment for the political reasons
                        stated. But the fact was that it would be difficult for Britain to join the
                        force unless the U.S. position on the veto was clear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it was his feeling we
                        were really talking about words and not substance. It was important to get
                        the language correct and this the U.S. would try to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> expressed concern about the
                        attitudes of Germans conducting the multilateral force negotiations. They
                        seemed to find it difficult to look at anything other than the original
                        multilateral force proposals, and there was some fuzziness about controls.
                        The danger was that if there was misunderstanding all around, strains within
                        the Alliance would be increased with all that that implied.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> described his
                        conversation on this subject with Von Hassel. He said he told the German
                        Defense Minister that the multilateral force would be a substitute for and
                        not an add-on to the U.S. nuclear strength with the Germans paying for
                        something the Americans had been financing hitherto. Moreover, the U.S.
                        would retain its veto. He also told Von Hassel the Germans had to assume
                        responsibility for selling the concept to the Germans—that the Americans
                        were only interested if the Europeans wanted it. The Americans would not do
                        the selling <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0175"/>job. (At this point
                        Healey asked whether the American effort over the past months could be
                        described as anything less than a selling effort.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> went on to say that in
                        reply Von Hassel told him categorically that the German Government [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. It
                        was concerned that if Germany did not have a role in the multilateral
                        mixed-manned force, elements within Germany would be pushing for more. In
                        addition, Von Hassel expressed the Germans' concern about possible U.S.
                        isolationism. They did not want to be left alone and felt the multilateral
                        force would serve to tie the U.S. to Europe for a long time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt certain there was
                        no misunderstanding about this in Von Hassel's mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> observed that he did
                        not see a great rush of the allies going forward in a tremendous force to
                        join the multilateral force.</p>
                    <p>To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that very few
                        things are done by acclamation. The idea seemed good to us. The Germans felt
                        it was important. The German problem is difficult and it was only prudent to
                        consider the matter very carefully.</p>
                    <p>Responding to <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName>'s assertions that the British
                        proposals in fact called for German-UK equality by bringing Germany in the
                        nuclear club, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reiterated
                        that equality of Germany with the other Europeans was most important. This
                        was the reason for the mixed-manned proposal. And redoing the concept now
                        would be difficult.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> thought the Germans
                        would be very equal if the British put in the weapons they were proposing
                        and agreed to share control. After all, control rather than manning was the
                        measure of equality.</p>
                    <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he
                        thought that over-emphasis on the veto seemed to throw the entire concept
                        out of kilter. More than one nation would make the decision and the U.S.
                        will be participating in the decision-making process.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> then said he did not
                        mind this at all if the U.S. would say it would always participate in the
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then reminded the British
                        that the prestige of the German Government was tied to the mixed-manned
                        concept. If Great Britain stood aside, an unequal situation would be
                        created. No matter what the British contributed to the force the important
                        point was that they had to participate in mixed-manning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> wondered why the U.S. was
                        pushing the British and not the Germans so hard. After all, the UK was
                        offering to provide one-third of the power of the force which included a
                        mixed-manned element. This was a higher share than was contemplated for the
                        British in the first place.</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0176"/>
                    <p>Sir Solly Zuckerman then intervened to raise the question of participation.
                        He pointed out that any one element could trigger the rest. Command
                        therefore was most important. If participation were subdivided there could
                        not be command.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> pointed out that in the
                        British view they were making a great concession by giving the Germans
                        control over what they put into the force. But Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> argued that if the British followed
                        through on what they were suggesting they would be avoiding participation in
                        something in which everyone else joined.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> denied this again, enumerating
                        the proposed British contribution of 4 submarines and 5 to 6 squadrons of
                        mixed-manned V-bombers. Not everyone need mix in the fleet and in the V-
                        bombers. Equality in effect—repeating <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName>'s earlier point—was not established by mixed-manning;
                        equality was derived from control.</p>
                    <p>As the President and the Prime Minister rejoined the group, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> ended this phase of the discussion by
                        emphasizing that there was a need to give the Germans full participation and
                        this could only be accomplished by avoiding special participation
                        arrangements for the British and others.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Prime Minister opened the conversation by saying he had 19 points to
                        raise in connection with the American paper and one general <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0177"/>question to ask—was his assumption correct
                        that the British paper<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">See <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>. A list of the questions, numbering 20 rather
                            than 19, and the answers are attached to the December 15 memorandum from
                            Bundy cited in <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.</note> and the
                        American paper entitled “Comments on the UK Proposal” (attached) were to be
                        read together? (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        indicated that they could, but this would not imply a commitment by the US
                        side.)</p>
                    <p>Then, referring to the American paper, he wondered whether the phrase at the
                        bottom of page 1 to the effect “any future agreement must be acceptable to
                        the alliance” implied a readiness to accept a French veto. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said this was not the case.)</p>
                    <p>On page 2, under the section on “Objectives”, he thought a third item should
                        be added indicating that anything done in this context should not foreclose
                        the possibility of an East-West detente.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said the British would have to reserve their position on
                        paragraph 3 c. dealing with the surface fleet.</p>
                    <p>He felt paragraph 3 d. lacked definition. Moreover, it was the British
                        impression that the Nassau commitment required equal U.S. and U.K.
                        contributions.</p>
                    <p>The British felt further discussion was needed of the permissive action
                        links. The Prime Minister reserved the British position on the “eventual
                        mixed-manning of submarines.”</p>
                    <p>He said the UK could not make a commitment to contribute manpower to the
                        operation of a mixed-manned surface force and would have to reserve on
                        paragraph 4 b.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked for a fuller explanation of the phrase “a partial
                        substitute” for programmed U.S. forces in paragraph 4 c. (The British
                        subsequently accepted “substitution for part of” as an unambiguous and
                        understandable word.)</p>
                    <p>In connection with paragraph 4 d., he wondered about the firmness of the
                        figure “not less than 200 missiles” and specifically how Blue Steel,
                        V-bombers, and other British contributions might be counted against the
                        total.</p>
                    <p>As for paragraph 4 e., the Prime Minister said the British were in agreement
                        but this raised the question of maintaining national communication with the
                        submarines in the event the force was dissolved. This problem clearly needed
                        further discussion and understanding.</p>
                    <p>With reference to paragraph 5 on the possible contribution of U.S. strategic
                        weapons he wondered which weapons the U.S. had in mind and whether the U.S.
                        contribution would match the British.</p>
                    <p>He reserved Britain's position on paragraph 7 dealing with command
                        arrangements and the force's NATO connection.</p>
                    <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0178"/>
                    <p>He said the British welcomed the first sentence of paragraph 8, but could not
                        accept the second sentence. In their view, provision had to be made for a
                        specific UK veto as well as a potential French veto. (<persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> elaborated on this to say
                        that however this was done, the countries having the veto had to be
                        specifically named.)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he was unclear as to what was meant by “France” in
                        paragraph 9 (which called for periodic meetings of defense ministers). If
                        this were to take place in the multilateral force context, Britain, by
                        having given up its independent deterrent, would be meeting France on
                        unequal terms. This made no sense. The entire paragraph should be dropped.
                        If the suggestions dealt with periodic defense ministers' meetings outside
                        the framework of the multilateral force, this would best be raised in
                        another context.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he was not sure what the phrase “a unified Europe” in
                        paragraph 10 meant. There was no precise definition of this. Definition was
                        important because the British were against U.S. surrendering its veto to
                        several things that might pass for a unified Europe. More specifically, how
                        would this qualification be phrased without suggesting that the U.S. would
                        sell off its share, and thus vitiate its veto.</p>
                    <p>In the last sentence of para. 10, the Prime Minister asked whether the words
                        “new as of now” could be added to protect the British position. Without this
                        qualification, the British might be placed in the category of a non-nuclear
                        power at the time of the force's dissolution. (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed there was no problem here. He
                        said the language was designed to prevent the establishment of new
                        systems.)</p>
                    <p>In para. 11 a., the Prime Minister expressed uncertainty as to the meaning of
                        the phrase “these matters.” He presumed this meant the totality of both the
                        U.S. and UK documents and comments. (The Secretary agreed it did.)</p>
                    <p>And as for para. 11 b., he wanted the whole section deleted. As it now stood
                        it put France above the UK.</p>
                    <p>Replying to the Prime Minister's comments, the Secretary of State said that
                        the proposed proviso concerning the possible frustration of an East-West
                        deterrent had to be handled carefully. The multilateral force concept had to
                        be dealt with in a context other than nonproliferation. The Soviets had to
                        understand that this force could only be subject to the process of
                        disarmament and could not be canceled out in a non-dissemination
                        framework.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to explain that the question of the numbers of missiles
                        and possible substitutions had to mean specifically the submarine
                        Polarises—not free-falling bombs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> added that the UK paper seemed to make it clear that
                        the subs would replace the V-bombers and therefore both the subs and the
                        V-bombers could not be added together. The 200 had to be Polaris
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with the Prime
                        Minister that direct national communication with the submarines was needed
                        in the event of dissolution <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0179"/>of the
                        force. He assured the Prime Minister this and <gloss target="#t_PAL1">PAL</gloss> could be handled so that the interests of the UK and the
                        U.S. would be protected.</p>
                    <p>At this juncture British Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> turned the conversation to the Nassau communique,
                        asserting that the U.S. had agreed to an equal contribution with the UK.
                        Unless this were done, the UK contribution would be difficult to sell
                        politically.</p>
                    <p>Replying to this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                        we had to be concerned with two concepts of equality—one with Germany which
                        was essential and the other was equality with the U.S. which had to be
                        brought into sensible focus. As for the Nassau commitment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> made the point that this present
                        concept was far more ambitious than that envisaged at Nassau and therefore
                        the Nassau communique could not be governing. Moreover, the U.S. was
                        prepared to make a very substantial contribution to the surface fleet.</p>
                    <p>Joining the argument, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        added that one had to look at the Nassau components as linked
                        parts—requiring the U.S. and UK to join the multilateral force, without
                        specifying the contributions but making it clear that the input would be
                        seaborne. The clear implication was there would be British participation in
                        the multilateral arrangement—the mixed-manned element.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the same point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said there was a significant difference between the
                        British problem and that of the U.S. The UK wanted to put its total
                        strategic force in the hands of the Alliance. Therefore, it was to the
                        British advantage to put the submarines into the new force. The British
                        could put specific ships in with an irrevocable commitment. The U.S. could
                        not follow suit and it was therefore not possible to insist upon an equal
                        contribution. Since the ships involved would be a portion of the total U.S.
                        force, the U.S. would have to be able to rotate them. The arrangement
                        therefore must be asymmetrical. Moreover, the U.S. contribution to the force
                        could not be part of an Anglo-American package; it had to be handled in a
                        broader context.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> was prepared to accept this
                        rationale. He added, however, a U.S. contribution of submarines to the force
                        should be equal to the British even though the terms of the assignment might
                        be different.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Prime Minister made some comments about the Nassau meeting
                        generally, saying it was hastily and badly done. This time he hoped the
                        nuclear issues were being handled more sensibly and perhaps the services of
                        Neustadt would not be called for again.</p>
                    <p>Going on to a discussion of voting arrangements, the Prime Minister made the
                        point that the right of decision to fire the force was also the right of
                        decision not to fire the force. <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> seized this opportunity again to explain the
                        difference between nuclear and nonnuclear members of the force and to insist
                        the British did not want to be locked into a European veto but had to have a
                        veto all their own.</p>
                    <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0180"/>
                    <p>This caused Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to ask whether
                        the British were not thereby denying German equality.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>, ignoring this point, went on
                        to stress that the nuclear powers had to retain their vetoes, otherwise
                        nuclear proliferation would take place.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> ended this part of the
                        discussion by saying that this problem of how the Europeans organized
                        themselves had to be dealt with on the other side of the Atlantic between
                        the British and the other Europeans.</p>
                    <p>This brought the discussion back to paragraph 9 with <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> reiterating that the American
                        proposal tended to give France a political advantage over the UK.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> denied this and asked
                        rhetorically whether the British were prepared to accept a breakdown of
                        communication with France. And after some more remarks by the British
                        Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister said this particular problem could be
                        resolved by dropping the paragraph entirely.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the definition of a unified Europe, as used in paragraph 10,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> reiterated it could
                        be anything, including Fouchet's version—and if this were the case, the
                        question of a European force without a U.S. veto was absolutely out of the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> denied there was
                        any fuzziness about the concept of a unified Europe. In political terms it
                        meant the delegations of authority to a single political executive empowered
                        to make decisions of peace and war. To deny that we would never give up the
                        veto would imply we were against the unification of Europe and play directly
                        into the hands of the Gaullists. The U.S. could not promise that it would
                        retain its veto forever. It could make it clear that without a veto it would
                        have no interest in maintaining its share of the force and feel free to
                        withdraw its umbrella. (This pleased <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> and he said so.)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister agreed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s
                        point was most important, and added that the establishment of a new nuclear
                        power via the European route was intolerable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reiterated if the
                        European force went European it would have to do so without U.S. warheads.
                        But the important point was that we had to be responsive to the honorable
                        and responsible Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> reminded the Prime
                        Minister that this problem was already with us. France was a nuclear power
                        without the U.S. or UK veto. And Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> added we clearly would not have sovereign power over
                        such nations; all we could do was make their enterprises more difficult.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said he had no problem with
                        this point so long as the ideas just exchanged were properly spelled
                        out.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0181"/>
                    <p>Turning to the German aspects of the case, <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName> asked whether the Americans could not tell the Germans
                        that the U.S. was not partial to any particular version of the multilateral
                        force so that an honest German reaction to the surface fleet might be
                        elicited.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied the long history of the concept made it impossible to
                        say at this juncture that specifics made no difference to the U.S. It was
                        too far along for that. However, the U.S. had no objections to the British
                        discussing this matter frankly with the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Amplifying the Secretary's remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the surface fleet had a number of purposes
                        and to say that the U.S. was now indifferent would be tantamount to
                        asserting that the conclusions reached over a long time were being
                        disregarded. There was no question that the German views should be based on
                        their needs and not on our desires. But there was no reason to believe their
                        views as given to us were not so based.</p>
                    <p>In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> stressed
                        the importance of giving the Germans a sense of the discussions taking place
                        here in Washington so they could make sensible judgment about the concept
                        and their commitment to it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> interjected to say that the
                        past proposals had been acceptable only to the Germans. The new proposals
                        would add the UK to the group of supporters. Indeed, this might well bring
                        others along. Therefore, when these discussions are reported to the Germans,
                        some sympathy should be shown to the UK proposals for, in fact, it is
                        important the UK needs be met along with the German needs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the Germans really did
                        not have many options. The alternatives to the mixed-manned surface force
                        were the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s which had been ruled and the
                        Minutemen which had been ruled out. So were the submarines. Therefore, their
                        only alternatives were ships and V-bombers. And the clear fact was that the
                        V-bombers were obsolescent.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then insisted that it was
                        difficult for Britain to participate in a surface fleet. Therefore, it was
                        important to be sure that British participation was an essential German
                        requirement and not merely something the Germans were stressing because they
                        thought the Americans wanted it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said he could understand the
                        British political problem, especially given the positions taken by the Labor
                        Party when it was in opposition. But it was difficult for him to conceive
                        that Britain, the “mother of sea power” could not recruit 100 technicians
                        for the mixed-manned force.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister took time out to say that the mixed-manned surface fleet
                        issue could bring the Labor Government down. Even though the Tory Government
                        had given equivocal support to this concept, the Tories were now ready to
                        bring the Labor Government down on this issue. Therefore, the U.S. position
                        was most important and the British <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0182"/>attitude toward the force would be governed by the permanence of the
                        American veto.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> reemphasized the need
                        for a clear British exchange with the Germans. And the Prime Minister,
                        picking up this point, said there ought not to be any impression anywhere of
                        an Anglo-American fix.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then changed the line of discussion and told the President
                        that he expected to have a problem with this broader issue next week when
                        there would be a parliamentary debate on foreign and defense policy. (In
                        passing, he commented caustically about the debate the Tories forced on him
                        on the eve of his Washington trip.) He expected the talk to be rough, but
                        promised to stand by the communique and “not to put a gloss on it.”<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">For text of the joint communique, see American
                            Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1964, pp. 615–616.</note> He assured
                        the President his statement of the American position would be the same as
                        that in the communique. But he also wanted to be able to discuss the British
                        document handed over the previous day and wondered whether this would cause
                        a problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he thought it could, because it was difficult to
                        debate publicly issues being discussed privately.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister noted he would feel compelled to spell out some of the
                        points covered in the communique and the Foreign Secretary added that the
                        government would almost certainly be forced to discuss the U.S. veto.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> felt suitable language could
                        be found. He thought this might be workable if the Prime Minister checked
                        his proposed language with us before he used it in parliament.</p>
                    <p>Saying he was thinking out loud, the Prime Minister told the President he
                        would tell the Commons where the UK Government stood; that it had presented
                        a comprehensive proposal; that he would stand on his earlier statements on
                        the surface fleet and non-proliferation; but that he would emphasize that
                        the problem was under discussion with the allies, and the British
                        participation in the mixed-manned force was being reserved. He would also
                        have to spell out the new British proposal but in his presentation would
                        play down negative aspects and stick to the communique in describing the
                        U.S. position. In any event, he would explain that all these proposals were
                        subject to allied decision.</p>
                    <p>There was a clear understanding at the end of this discussion that the Prime
                        Minister would have his proposed language on this matter, particularly that
                        dealing with the U.S. veto, cleared with the U.S. before he went before the
                        Commons.</p>

                    <p>U.S. COMMENTS ON THE UK PROPOSAL OF A PROJECT FORAN ATLANTIC NUCLEAR
                        FORCE</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Preamble</p>
                    <p>After review of our own views and those of our allies, and after particular
                        consideration of the proposals of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> for an
                        Atlantic nuclear force, we offer the following comments relating to the
                        establishment of such a force. These comments are designed to take account
                        both of the extended discussions which have occurred since 1962 and of the
                        new proposals of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We believe that any successful plan must be responsive to the real
                        requirements of as many members of the Alliance as possible. In this spirit,
                        we emphasize that these suggestions are subject to discussion and revision
                        in the light of the comments which will be sought from other interested
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>As the President and the Prime Minister have agreed from the beginning of
                        these discussions, no agreements or commitments are being made in this first
                        exchange of views. Moreover, the issues before us extend far beyond the
                        interests of our two nations alone, and any future agreement must be
                        acceptable to the Alliance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Objectives</p>
                    <p>We believe that any new arrangement of nuclear forces of NATO must meet the
                        following objectives:</p>
                    <p>a. To deter nuclear proliferation by making it possible for non-nuclear
                        members of the Atlantic Alliance to participate in the ownership, management
                        and control of NATO's nuclear forces through collective action and without
                        the creation of new independent national nuclear systems.</p>
                    <p>b. To strengthen the unity of the Alliance by providing for systematic and
                        greatly increased collaboration and consultation in the nuclear field.</p>
                    <p>3. Specific Comments on the UK's Proposed Force</p>
                    <p>We believe that it would be appropriate to have discussions with other
                        interested NATO governments of a concept of an Atlantic nuclear force which
                        might have the following components:</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0184"/>
                    <p>a. Three or four Polaris submarines to be transferred to the force by the
                        British Government.</p>
                    <p>b. Such elements of the British V-bomber force as <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> is prepared to contribute.</p>
                    <p>c. A Polaris surface fleet having substantially the characteristics—if not
                        the size—of that contemplated in the discussions of the working group in
                        Paris. This force should have a size adequate to the needs and interests of
                        non-nuclear powers which wish to participate in it, but we are prepared to
                        discuss reductions from the initial proposals in the light of other
                        contributions now in contemplation.</p>
                    <p>d. Such strategic nuclear forces as the United States or France might be
                        prepared to subscribe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Characteristics of the Force</p>
                    <p>a. We consider it essential that all elements of the force be under a common
                        command and control arrangement, including permissive action links. While
                        the Polaris submarines could be organized at least initially on a basis of
                        national manning, the eventual mixed-manning of submarines should not be
                        precluded if subsequent studies indicate its feasibility and
                        desirability.</p>
                    <p>b. We also consider it essential to the success of this proposal that there
                        should be a substantial UK contribution of manpower for the operation of the
                        mixed-manned surface force, in order to insure that this arrangement
                        commands the confidence of other participants.</p>
                    <p>c. Creation of this force should be conceived not as an addition to strategic
                        forces that would otherwise be provided, but as a partial substitute, since
                        it is the current expectation that presently programmed US forces will be
                        appropriately reduced as the new force comes into being.</p>
                    <p>d. We believe that the new force, whatever its eventual components, should
                        have a strength of not less than 200 missiles.</p>
                    <p>e. All the weapons systems transferred to the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> would be committed for the life of the force. In the event
                        of dissolution of the force, submarines and bombers would revert to the
                        national ownership of the respective contributing state. Missiles and
                        warheads in the surface fleet would also be returned to the supplying
                        country.</p>
                    <p>f. We are prepared to consider a change in the name of the force, but we
                        believe a decision on the name should be reserved to later multilateral
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Contribution of the United States Forces</p>
                    <p>Should the concept discussed above prove acceptable to other allies, we would
                        be prepared to consider a contribution to this new force of certain U.S.
                        strategic weapons provided that discussions with other allies<pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0185"/> indicate a general desire for such a
                        contribution, and provided that it can be made on terms which are
                        practicable for the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Non-Dissemination</p>
                    <p>The treaty establishing the new arrangements should include undertakings
                        whereby nuclear members would agree not to disseminate nuclear weapons and
                        the non-nuclear members would undertake not to acquire, or obtain control
                        over, them.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Command Arrangements in Relation to NATO </p>
                    <p>We take note of the suggestion that the Atlantic missile force described
                        above might be assigned to a separate commander. We are also familiar with
                        the strongly expressed view of other allies that this force should be under
                        the command of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. We think that this
                        question of command should be left open for discussion among all interested
                        parties.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Voting Arrangements</p>
                    <p>The agreement of the United States would be required in order to fire the
                        force. The votes of the European members should be cast in a manner agreed
                        to by them. The voting procedure could be revised only with the agreement of
                        all of the participating nations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Periodic Meetings of the Ministers of Defense</p>
                    <p>In order to make more effective the present procedures for consultation among
                        the Western Powers, we suggest periodic meetings of the Ministers of
                        Defense. These meetings would be held on an informal basis, and would
                        consider targeting policy, new nuclear and conventional weapons
                        developments, nuclear dispersal plans, future force structure, resource
                        allocation, and strategy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Review Provisions</p>
                    <p>We believe any agreement should contain provisions for review of the
                        arrangements if (a) Germany is reunified; (b) a unified Europe is
                        established, or (c) there is a major movement toward arms control or
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>As stated in 8 above, any new agreement would require the approval of all
                        participants, and we note that in the case of the US any change in control
                        arrangements would be subject to full Constitutional approval.</p>
                    <p>The agreement should be so drafted that termination of the Force would not
                        result in the creation of new national nuclear systems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">11. Future Procedure</p>
                    <p>a. A meeting of representatives of interested governments should be held
                        early in 1965. They should be asked to review these matters and to prepare
                        recommendations for their respective governments.</p>
                    <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0186"/>
                    <p>b. At an early stage in the development of these recommendations, and well
                        before any final agreements are reached among interested parties,
                        arrangements should be made for discussions with the Government of
                        France.</p>

                            1964</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>The President has asked me to make his position very clear to Lord Harlech,
                        in order that there be no misunderstanding of the forebearance and restraint
                        with which he conducted his discussions of the Atlantic nuclear problem with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>. I am doing this, and I
                        shall explain to Lord Harlech that I am doing it at the direct request of
                        the President. As I said on the telephone,<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">This
                            telephone conversation has not been further identified.</note> I believe
                        it would be helpful for you to say these things to the Prime Minister,
                        although not on the basis of a direct Presidential instruction. I think you
                        are right in worrying about the temptations Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> may feel in the heat of debate, and you are the one
                        in the best position to give him a personal warning on this specific
                        point.</p>
                    <p>What I shall say to <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Lord Harlech</persName> at the
                        President's direction is the following:</p>
                    <p>1. The President wants to be very sure that the Prime Minister does not
                        misunderstand his position on the nuclear force problem. The President and
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> are both political
                        men and the President in particular knows what a close election is like. It
                        seemed to them that it would be unfair to force an immediate decision,
                        against his previous record, on a man who has been in power less than two
                        months, with a four-seat majority and a very grave economic and financial
                        crisis on his hands. The President therefore decided not to force the pace
                        with the Prime Minister, but rather to allow his advisers to explain
                        American thinking as clearly as they could within a framework which the
                        President deliberately set as one of discussion and not of decision.</p>
                    <p>2. The President also recognized and understood the importance of giving the
                        British a free hand in finding out for themselves the real <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0187"/>position and convictions of the Government
                        in Bonn. The Laborites have been telling us for a long time that we do not
                        properly understand the Germans. There is every reason for the Prime
                        Minister to satisfy himself directly on this point, and if we have been
                        wrong in our estimate of the Germans, no one is more interested than we in
                        finding out.</p>
                    <p>3. But by the same token, we hope that the British Government will take very
                        seriously whatever they do find in their discussions with the Germans, and
                        our own first impression, after a very frank and entirely open-ended
                        discussion with Schroeder,<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> visited Washington
                            November 23–24. In addition to several bilateral topics, he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> discussed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> with Schroeder saying that Bonn would
                            not accept discrimination against Germany in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and stressing the need to conclude negotiations by
                            March of 1965. (Memorandum of conversation, November 26; Department of
                            State, Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>))</note>
                        is that the British will find the Germans at least as firm on a number of
                        basic questions as we have thought.</p>
                    <p>4. Meanwhile the President is gravely concerned by the risk that the Prime
                        Minister may give others the impression that the U.S. has in any way backed
                        off from its basic assessment of the situation as outlined in the paper of
                        comments which was given to Her Majesty's Government on December 8.<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">Attachment to <ref target="#d61">Document
                            61</ref>.</note> The fact that the President himself did not press the
                        argument was merely an indication of his desire not to force the judgment on
                        the Prime Minister now. The President noted that the Prime Minister himself
                        did not pursue the argument on specific points, and his assumption is that
                        the two governments will eventually have to bring the matter to a decision
                        after due allowance for discussions which are in prospect with others.</p>
                    <p>5. The President has asked me to emphasize particularly to the Ambassador the
                        very great damage which could be done if the Prime Minister should take a
                        line next week in the House of Commons that would make those eventual
                        decisions more difficult. The President knows the temptations of debate, and
                        he has already had one painful experience with a speech of the Prime
                        Minister in the House of Commons.<note n="5" xml:id="d62fn5">Presumably a
                            reference to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s November 23
                            speech.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>If the impression should be created in the United States that the Prime
                        Minister was trying to strengthen his position by seeming to have “won a
                        victory” over Washington, the President would find it necessary to take a
                        very different attitude toward this whole series of discussions.</p>
                    <p>I will tell the Ambassador, as my personal judgment, that a man in the Prime
                        Minister's position would be extremely ill-advised to run any risks of this
                        sort with a sensitive and determined man like President <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0188"/>Johnson, since the President has plenty of
                        cards to play if this becomes a public contest. I shall tell <persName corresp="#p_HLWDOG1">Lord Harlech</persName> that the President has shown
                        great restraint in these last days because of his concern to avoid any
                        appearance of running a power play against a weak opponent. But if his
                        generosity is misunderstood, I doubt if it is likely to last.</p>

                        <item>The Value of Your Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. A couple of times in the last few days you have strongly expressed to me
                        your doubts about the value of having <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold
                            Wilson</persName> here. Since I think that this was without doubt the
                        most productive and useful two days that we have had in foreign affairs
                        since President Kennedy went to Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">June 26,
                            1963.</note> I would like to urge the opposite view for a minute.</p>
                    <p>2. Let me begin with the obvious negative fact that there is just no way in
                        the world that a President of the United States can avoid reasonably regular
                        visits from the Prime Minister of Great Britain. If you had said to
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> that you were unwilling to
                        see him in December, the reaction everywhere would have been strongly
                        critical. You may feel that this is outrageous, given the difference between
                        his position and yours, but it is a fact. Winston Churchill made it so.</p>
                    <p>3. There can be real inconvenience in these meetings, because there is no
                        certain way of predicting what issues will come up. The Nassau meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">December 18–21, 1962.</note> was not set up to
                        deal with Skybolt, which broke over its head <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0189"/>because of the timing of our DOD budget. There was no such
                        difficulty this time, because we knew that the Atlantic nuclear problem
                        would be at center stage, but the handling of the matter was certainly very
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>4. In this situation the first achievement was to avoid a failure. You
                        received a very strong recommendation to force Wilson to a decision, and you
                        carefully walked around that and took a different and better course. This
                        was a major achievement and it had several consequences:</p>
                    <p>(1) We have had a very straight and honest talk with the British back and
                        forth on the hard elements of the problem, and they have gone off to talk on
                        their own with the Germans. This puts the ball back in the European court,
                        and places you as the firm but patient leader of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>(2) You have laid basis for political education and political leadership with
                        Congress as the progress of the enterprise justifies it. We have a major
                        problem of communication with the Leadership and the relevant committees,
                        but we have won time in which to go about it.</p>
                    <p>(3) Perhaps most important of all, this meeting has forced discussions
                        between you and your advisers which has for the first time given both you
                        and them a clear understanding of the problem and the way you want it
                        treated.</p>
                    <p>(4) As a consequence, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        himself has reached the decision to reorganize the Department of State in
                        this area, and no more important or constructive administrative decision has
                        been made in the last 18 months in that Department. It is true that that
                        decision should have been made a year ago, but it wasn't. It may seem
                        strange that an internal administrative decision should have to wait upon a
                        meeting between you and the British Prime Minister, but that is how this
                        Government has worked for a generation. The President signals his real
                        beliefs at his convenience, and this is the time that was convenient and
                        right for you. If I had sent you a memorandum on the way to handle the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> last August or September, you would
                        quite properly have ignored it, and without clear proof of your own personal
                        view, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> simply would not
                        have acted.</p>
                    <p>5. From now on, it seems to me, the progress of this Atlantic negotiation
                        will need your own continued personal command, and I will make it my
                        business to make sure that the state of the play is before you at every
                        stage and that every significant decision is signaled as far ahead of time
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>6. So, in sum, the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> meeting has
                        not only been a modest success in its own right, but a turning point in the
                        process by which you take the effective command of a major issue of foreign
                        policy. This is quite a lot for two days—and I am omitting the fringe
                        benefit that at least a hundred of your warmest political supporters were
                        given a thank-you dinner of <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0190"/>the
                        most fashionable possible sort, because glamour is one thing the British
                        still bring with them.</p>
                    <p>Unrepentantly,</p>
                    <p>P.S. I am doing a separate memo on the exact negotiating position on this
                        issue as I now understand it. This is simply an informal defense of the fact
                        that we had a meeting at all.</p>
                    <p>P.P.S. I am also doing a memo on what you might say about this on Saturday if
                        you have a press conference; I think there is quite a lot.</p>

                    <p>Secto 12. Following report of conversation between Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, Noforn, and subject to revision on review.</p>
                    <p>Together with <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> Secretary called on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> today. He had with him Alphand
                        and interpreter Andronikof.</p>
                    <p>The conversation lasted for one hour and a half and was cordial and relaxed.
                        Secretary conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        greetings from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        which he received with pleasure and expressed his gratification at
                        President's electoral victory.</p>
                    <p>The conversation covered essentially two subjects: 1) Germany and its future,
                        and 2) future defense of Europe and American role therein.</p>
                    <p>Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was very anxious
                        that our two countries should have a clear exchange of views in order to
                        clear up any misunderstandings and clarify any obscure points in the many
                        complicated questions that were before them; that Secretary would like to
                        speak about the present involvement, and particularly military presence in
                        Europe, which stemmed from two different sources. One was responsibilities
                        left over from World War II which was shared with France in regard to the
                        unsettled business of Germany and Berlin. <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0191"/>These obligations we felt would remain upon us as long as
                        Germany remained divided and Berlin remained divided. The second reason was
                        expressed in the NATO treaty which the U.S. had adopted in 1949 following
                        the events in Czechoslovakia, the menace to Western Europe from rearmament
                        of Eastern Europe, and certain indications that Stalin has given in regard
                        to military conquests in Europe. This had been a big step for the U.S. to
                        take and had been a reversal of previous policy of isolationism, but these
                        commitments had been seriously meant and for a long term.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said of course it was conceivable that at some date in the future
                        Europe might be able to organize its own defense but that there had as yet
                        been no signs, either in budgetary matters or in allocation or resources or
                        in other fields, although at some point in the future it would be possible
                        to discuss it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> if he
                        could give his views in regard to the U.S. involvement in the defense of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in his reply said he
                        understood Secretary was speaking of two subjects: Germany and its future,
                        and the future defense of Europe.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Germany he said the U.S. had after World War I helped Germany to
                        recover, had opposed reparations from Germany, and had been against the
                        occupation of the Ruhr, and had helped Germany industry through investment,
                        etc. U.S. assistance after World War II had been even more marked; Marshall
                        Plan, stationing of troops in Germany and in West Berlin, and assistance in
                        the involvement of West Germany in the Western camp.</p>
                    <p>France had suffered much from Germany, had with perhaps greater caution
                        accepted the reemergence of Germany as a natural phenomenon, particularly
                        after World War II in the light of the Soviet menace, and had rendered
                        modest economic, moral and even military assistance. France, however, was
                        more alert to the long term dangers of German revival since it was true that
                        an “unhappy” Germany was not dangerous, but a prosperous Germany began to
                        develop ambitions which through her national heritage and geographic
                        position could be dangerous. He said Germany was a matter of concern to all
                        European countries, even including England. There were three questions of
                        importance in regard to Germany's future development. One related to
                        frontiers, in which France considered that the existing frontiers, of
                        Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Austria, were just and should be the definitive
                        boundaries of Germany. The second question was that of reunification. France
                        was not opposed since this was logical and human, but it could not be done
                        against the opposition of the East. The countries of Eastern Europe were
                        against it and therefore it was not a current question. The third question
                        was the German military power. Germany has conventional forces in NATO <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0192"/>where they represented no danger to
                        anyone, but the acquisition by Germany either directly or indirectly of
                        nuclear power would not be acceptable to France, nor he felt to any other
                        European country, certainly in the East, nor did he feel in the West. The
                        advantage of any such development would be derisory whereas the
                        disadvantages would be very great.</p>
                    <p>On reunification, he raised the question of how this could be achieved. He
                        said the policy which he attributed to John Foster Dulles of using positions
                        of strength had not impressed the Soviets and had not brought reunification
                        and was therefore abandoned. One other possibility, certainly opposed by the
                        French, was West Germany going over to the Soviet side, and perhaps with a
                        regime favorable to the Soviet Union some arrangement for reunification
                        could be worked out. This was only a theory and not in his opinion a
                        possibility. The third possibility was that at some point in the future the
                        East, particularly Moscow, would agree on conditions relating especially to
                        German military power which would lead to the reunification of Germany. This
                        was not an unimaginable possibility but it might take a long while. In any
                        event there seemed to be no other solution and in the meantime Germany would
                        have to remain as it was.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the defense of Europe, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> stated that the U.S. had indeed assured the defense of
                        Western Europe in the immediate post-war years, for which thanks were due.
                        He had already said so publicly and would say so again. But now no one in
                        Europe believed in the imminence of a Soviet attack, nor he felt did the
                        U.S. It was not considered likely that the Soviet Union, Brezhnev and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2"> Leonid I. Brezhnev, First Secretary of the Communist

                        the West would attack the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the countries of Europe have changed. They have recovered their
                        economic health, and certain countries, in particular France and potentially
                        Germany, are beginning to acquire a sense of international responsibility.
                        He did not speak of Italy or Great Britain, which are different cases.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Couve <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">de

                    <p>France now is making nuclear bombs, although few in number, but Germany is
                        trying through the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to get some control
                        of U.S. bombs. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that
                        the form, and he repeated the form, of the Alliance no longer corresponded
                        to reality. The U.S. which had been the sole deciding voice in the Alliance
                        earlier had made its own plans, placed troops in Europe, deployed tactical
                        nuclear weapons, and had plans for escalation <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0193"/>which would involve at a certain time under certain
                        conditions, as yet unknown, the use of this nuclear power, but always on our
                        choice.</p>
                    <p>He said that he felt that the organization of the Alliance must be placed on
                        a new basis. He recalled that earlier he had proposed to President
                        Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan a change in the organization of NATO
                        but it has produced no results. At present the Alliance was cracking at the
                        seams, with France producing its own atomic weapons while Germany had none
                        and England was less and less disposed to make the necessary outlay of
                        expenses for the defense of Europe. He said that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would destroy NATO as we knew it. It would no longer be the
                        existing organization of the North Atlantic Treaty. Even if there was no
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> it would be necessary to remake the
                        organization before 1969.</p>
                    <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> stated that it
                        was not necessary to be integrated in order to be allied, citing in support
                        of this view the fact that in 1962 France had rallied to U.S. support over
                        the Cuban missile crisis although Cuba is not in NATO area.</p>
                    <p>Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> he wished to
                        comment on a number of his observations. In the first instance Secretary
                        could tell him privately that we were in full agreement in regard to his
                        position on the German frontiers. We had told the Germans that we had not
                        fought World War II in order to become involved in World War III over German
                        claims to lands in Eastern Europe. We were not stating our position publicly
                        since the Germans hoped to be able to use it for bargaining purposes in an
                        eventual peace conference, but if the Germans spoke about it publicly in
                        Germany we might have to make our position public.</p>
                    <p>In regard to reunification, we agreed that it would take a long time and we
                        did not believe either in any policy of forcible reunification. We felt that
                        too long a division would provide a fertile ground for the emergence of bad
                        elements in Germany due to frustration. It was our hope that at some point
                        in the future Eastern European countries would see that German reunification
                        was really to their interest and that possibly, if coupled with some form of
                        disarmament, might be more palatable to them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> interjected here the
                        comment that a divided Germany is a matter of concern but unified Germany is
                        also a matter of concern.</p>
                    <p>As to German force, we have a feeling that there are two ways in which a
                        nation becomes involved in nuclear matters: 1) national control over
                        national weapons, and 2) as a target. There are a number of nations in
                        Europe that are targets to Soviet missiles and we felt they had a right to
                        participate in certain aspects of nuclear matters and that this was what the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was trying to do. It was a means of
                        preventing the Germans from developing in the future a national weapon.</p>
                    <p>We had originally supposed that France, while not taking part, had no
                        objection other European members taking part. It now appears that <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0194"/>French objections are more
                        specific. Also, we did not see the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as
                        the first of a series of steps ending in national German nuclear capability.
                        We felt that like the question of unification, to absolutely deny any German
                        involvement in nuclear matters would bring into power the wrong kind of
                        Germans.</p>
                    <p>Finally Secretary said that while we did agree that in December 1964 there
                        was very little chance of the Soviets initiating an attack we were not
                        completely certain that such a situation would last. At the end of World War
                        II we had demobilized our forces thereby possibly exposing Stalin to
                        temptation. Two years ago had been the Cuban missile crisis, and about two
                        and one half years ago the Berlin menace. We would like to observe further
                        developments behind the Iron Curtain and the emergence of contacts with the
                        West in similar matters before coming to the conclusion about the
                        possibility of future crisis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> replied that he agreed
                        completely that while there were no grounds for fearing an attack at the
                        moment this did not mean that there never would be. He mentioned in this
                        connection China. He was in complete agreement that there was no basis in
                        the modern world for any form of unilateral disarmament and that was why the
                        French Government, at great expense, was developing a nuclear arm. It also
                        was for this reason why the French Government felt that the maintenance of
                        the Alliance was of great importance. It is true, he said, that the French
                        had not taken the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> so seriously in the
                        beginning since they thought it was more or less in the nature of a military
                        theme or a staff study, but that recently the Germans and ourselves, and he
                        emphasized we were the only two that counted, had given the thing much more
                        substance. He said the French fully realized we were retaining control of
                        our bombs and it is our decision alone in regard to their use, but
                        nevertheless the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would give the
                        appearance of German participation; for example, targeting in the East which
                        would have a bad effect in Eastern Europe and not too good in the West. He
                        said if it had the advantage of assuring that Germans would never get the
                        weapon this might be some compensation, but he said you know and we know
                        that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will not eliminate the German
                        appetite but will in all probability increase it, and added that the U.S.
                        might be able to prevent them from acquiring the bomb but could not prevent
                        them wanting it. He said even more importantly it changed the entire texture
                        of the organization of the Alliance which had been based upon the
                        proposition of the equality of European countries under the protection of
                        the U.S. and this would give the Germans a privileged position. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be disastrous for NATO.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said in conclusion that he wished to assure President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that never at any time either in
                        its inception or subsequent development had the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> been considered by the U.S. as aimed at France or in
                        conflict with French interests. We had always understood that at some <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>time in the future there would be
                        discussions among NATO members on nuclear matters; that we had understood
                        from previous conversations with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> that they were not yet prepared for such discussions
                        and that we had genuinely thought that France had no objection to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed that at some time in
                        the future there would have to be such discussion on the coordination of
                        nuclear weapons in time of war. He said they would be ready to discuss this
                        in 1967 or 1968 at which time they would be ready to take up the changes in
                        the organization of the Alliance if there was no drama or crisis at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of another meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was left open and will be determined tomorrow.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">In a second conversation on December 16, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                            Alliance</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>We now face very important discussions with our Allies on future plans for
                        the nuclear defense of the Atlantic Alliance. I am sending you this
                        memorandum to establish guidelines for this discussion.</p>
                    <p>1. Unless I give specific instructions to the contrary, I do not wish any
                        American official in any forum to press for a binding agreement at <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"/>this time. I wish to maintain the
                        position established in our talks with Prime Minister Wilson—namely, that
                        the U.S. is not seeking to force its own views on any European nation, but
                        wishes rather to find a way of responding effectively to the largest
                        possible consensus among interested European allies.</p>
                    <p>2. At the same time I expect American negotiators to maintain the position
                        that no agreement can be made with the U.K. that does not take account of
                        the legitimate interests of Germany, and that similarly no agreement can be
                        made with Germany that does not take account of the legitimate interests of
                        other European states. The American negotiators should continue to encourage
                        direct discussion among Europeans, and in particular they should urge the
                        U.K. to seek agreement with Germany and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>3. I wish all American negotiators to avoid public or private quarrels with
                        France, and to maintain in public and private the following position: We are
                        interested in reducing our differences with France; we will never support
                        any proposal for a nuclear force which is in fact directed against France;
                        we will not sign any agreement which does not contain open doors for France;
                        nor will we make any agreement until after French opinion and French desires
                        have been carefully and responsibly explored.</p>
                    <p>4. Any agreement we support must be a reinforcement to our basic policy of
                        non-dissemination of nuclear weapons. We warmly support the inclusion in any
                        agreement of strong undertakings to this end.</p>
                    <p>5. Our position on the American veto and on the European clause is as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>“The United States takes the position that any charter for an Atlantic Force
                        must provide for United States' consent to the firing of the nuclear
                        weapons. If, however, major nations of Europe some day achieve full
                        political unity with a central political authority capable of making the
                        decision to use nuclear weapons, the United States recognizes that this will
                        create a new situation in which reconsideration of various provisions of the
                        charter would be appropriate. In any event, revision of the charter would be
                        possible only with the unanimous approval of the members.”</p>
                    <p>6. Our present position on other issues is as stated on December 8 in the
                        U.S. memorandum of comments (attached at A)<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Printed as the Attachment to <ref target="#d61">Document
                            61</ref>.</note> on the U.K. proposal, omitting the names of specific
                        countries in paragraph 9, and leaving that paragraph in abeyance for the
                        time being.</p>
                    <p>7. In my judgment, the principal advantages of any agreement will be:</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0197"/>
                    <p>(1) that it will lead the U.K. out of the field of strategic deterrence and
                        thus reduce by one the number of powers aiming at this kind of nuclear
                        strength;</p>
                    <p>(2) that it will greatly reduce the danger of any separate nuclear adventure
                        by the Germans; and</p>
                    <p>(3) that it will advance the principle and practice of collective strategic
                        defense, as against the proliferation of separate nuclear deterrents.</p>
                    <p>These three advantages are of great importance to the American public and to
                        all who care for world peace in other countries, and it is essential that
                        they be established in any agreement.</p>
                    <p>8. The provisions of NSAM 318 (attached at B)<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">Not
                            printed, but see <ref target="#d46fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            46</ref>.</note> will remain in effect (except for the action in
                        paragraph 6 which has been completed).</p>
                    <p>9. Finally, I find nothing in the position of this government or in the
                        posture of the alliance which makes it necessary, from the point of view of
                        the U.S. alone, that there should be final agreement or even agreement in
                        principle within the next three months. I may take a different view on this
                        in the light of new evidence, but this is my clear present position, and I
                        wish all actions by American officials to be in conformity with it. If other
                        governments for their own reasons find it important to reach early

                            December 15–17, and while considering many issues, focused heavily on a
                            review of the international situation in light of the fall of Khrushchev
                            and on Cyprus. Briefing papers, NATO documents, telegrams to and from

                    </p>
                    <p>1. As Secretary said to press, NATO members are today more secure and more
                        prosperous than ever before. This is measure of NATO success. Despite press
                        hand-wringing over NATO decay, delegations except for French expressed
                        importance of and need for NATO.</p>
                    <p>2. Contrary to expectation, meeting did not dodge contentious issues. Nuclear
                        problem overshadowed all other matters, on and off the floor.</p>
                    <p>3. In routine review of international situation, consensus was that no
                        immediate major change to be expected in post-Khrushchev Russia.
                        Soviet-ChiCom rivalry in underdeveloped world believed likely result in
                        sharper Soviet anti-West policy in those areas. Long-run effects of ChiCom
                        nuclear shot assessed as highly important.</p>
                    <p>4. Press appears to have read too much significance into two military
                        developments. First, it has tended to equate talk of future coordination of
                        targeting of French force de frappe with that of other nuclear forces with
                        agreement to participate in <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> or some
                        similar integrated nuclear operation. Fact is that no firm agreement on
                        French-US nuclear coordination yet reached and French remain wholly opposed
                        to <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Second, German remarks at meeting re
                        atomic demolition munitions (<gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>'s) [less
                        than 1 line of source text not declassified] have given impression
                        emplacement and use of such devices much closer to realization than is
                        evidently the fact. While use of <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>'s is
                        prominent feature in recent German views on NATO strategy, subject is still
                        under intensive study by US and German military as result <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-von Hassel November talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> visited Washington
                            November 12 for a discussion of NATO strategy. In a summary based on a
                            debriefing of Popper, who attended the talks, the Department of State
                            noted that there was wide agreement on such general topics as flexible
                            response, multiple options, and conventionality, but that on many
                            specifics there were important areas of disagreement. (Memorandum,
                            November 13; ibid.)</note>

                    <p>5. Discussions on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> resulted in rough threefold division of positions. At one
                        wing French did not conceal their opposition to this and other measures of
                        Atlantic integration; on other side major <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proponents defended its utility; middle group of Canada,
                        Scandinavian countries and Belgium indicated they were satisfied with
                        present situation. Latter group worried at divisive effect of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> discussion outside NATO forum. Germans,
                        Italians and Dutch pressed for mixed-manned surface force, in private
                        discussions; together with UK and US they agreed tentatively on high-level
                        multilateral meeting, perhaps at end of January, to work out general lines
                        of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Debate on NATO strategy showed growing recognition all-out general nuclear
                        exchange not suitable way of meeting crisis situations. Also showed
                        increasing comprehension of need for flexible, non-nuclear response to most
                        likely contingencies of unpremeditated, smaller-scale conflict. However
                        French are still unyielding on trip-wire concept. Continuation of NATO Force
                        Planning Exercise as agreed at meeting provides best means of bringing about
                        modernization of NATO strategic concept.</p>
                    <p>7. Secretary's high-level talks with French produced better atmosphere, but
                        little change in substantive positions. On other hand, Franco-German
                        relations deteriorated as result French refusal to agree to quadripartite
                        communique stressing time had come for initiative on reunification. (You
                        will recall Germans issued communique stating French had not approved it.)
                        In meetings, French were isolated on approach to NATO in general, and to
                        some extent on strategic problems.</p>

                    <p>2547. Subj: <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. At my meeting with Schroeder
                        on Jan 7 I found him at a loss as to how next to proceed with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He felt that the US had <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0200"/>lost interest in helping to facilitate
                        reaching an agreement among the interested parties. In this connection he
                        referred to the June 13, 1964 communique of the President and the Chancellor
                        which envisaged signature of an agreement by the end of 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">For text, see Department of State Bulletin, June 29,

                            would be a mistake to set a precise date for a Ministerial meeting to
                            discuss the multilateral nuclear force although he thought they should
                            aim for the end of January. The intervening period should be used for
                            bilateral meetings to narrow the differences between the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and the proposed British <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. (Secto 21 from Bonn, December 15;
                            Department of State, Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>))</note> He had small hopes of achieving progress in
                        the talks with Wilson here January 22 (he noted that <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon Walker</persName> was not coming). He assumed
                        that nothing important would happen until there could be a high level
                        multilateral meeting.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I repeated what I had told the Chancellor on my return from
                        Washington. We have not lost interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The US, the Germans and others had developed a position
                        concerning which the British and others had raised questions. In seeking a
                        solution to the question of nuclear responsibility within the Alliance on as
                        broad a basis as possible, we are willing to adjust our initial position in
                        order to seek a wide consensus. In doing so we would insist that the
                        interests of the Germans would be fully protected. We are not leaving the
                        Germans to negotiate the matter out with the British. We are in this
                        together.</p>
                    <p>We hope that a multilateral meeting can be held soon. In the meantime, we do
                        not wish to exert pressures or establish deadlines in reaching a consensus.
                        We respect the legitimate interests of all concerned. We would not support
                        any agreement directed against the French and believe they (French) should
                        be kept fully informed on this matter. While we had no reason to think they
                        could be persuaded to join an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, we wanted
                        to keep the door open for them. There was some basis for believing they
                        might at least acquiesce in an agreement reached by others. When the force
                        de frappe became operational, there are indications of French willingness to
                        coordinate in some way in its planning and targeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">On January 1, the Department of State had informed its

                            activity by the group of five that had met on December 15, but that
                            bilateral conversations should take place. (Telegram 4113 to London;

                    </p>
                    <p>Schroeder's response was that it was very important for the US to correct the
                        misimpression that it was no longer interested in achieving an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> agreement. He was not specific on how this
                        should be done but <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0201"/>apparently had
                        in mind high-level statements or press backgrounders. He concluded by saying
                        that unless we exerted pressure on the British, he was afraid nothing would
                        happen.</p>
                    <p>Comment: Schroeder's statements, of course, were made without knowledge of

                            January 7. (Ibid., DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>)) In his
                            meeting with Knappstein on January 7, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> reaffirmed the U.S. interest in finding a solution
                            to the nuclear force question, stressing that a consensus of at least
                            German, Italian, and British views was necessary. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that it would be advantageous
                            for the Germans to talk with the Italians and concluded that the
                            forthcoming meeting between <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> would offer an
                            opportunity for useful bilateral discussions.</note> The Secretary's
                        reaffirmation of our interest in an agreement as well as in a Ministerial
                        meeting will be welcome to Erhard and Schroeder. They will, however,
                        continue to feel that significant movement will not occur without the US
                        playing a more active role than seems we now appear to envisage in obtaining
                        a consensus. There is a widespread feeling here in all circles—government,
                        diplomatic and press—that the US has abandoned interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—“that it is dead.”</p>
                    <p>For this view there are several explanations. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, always reluctant to take the initiative on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, is now even more diffident after
                        Schroeder's clash with Couve de Murville at Paris and the subsequent
                        weakening of his position here. Secondly, the Germans doubt the utility of
                        bilateral meetings and far prefer a multilateral forum. Thirdly, as
                        Schroeder indicated above, they have almost no confidence that the British
                        will agree to a consensus on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> without US pressure. One of the principal reasons for
                        German concern is the feeling that we have left them alone to negotiate the
                        matter out with the British.</p>
                    <p>In this connection <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>'s <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> interview of December 20 has given the
                        Foreign Office further grounds for belief that the British are more
                        interested in pushing non-dissemination and getting rid of their nuclear
                        capability at a good price than preserving the basic principles of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances I feel strongly that we must do more to diminish
                        the German fear that they are to be left alone to negotiate a viable
                        agreement, while the US stands by passively awaiting the achievement of a
                        consensus. I would appreciate it if consideration could be given urgently to
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>1. A personal message from the Secretary to Schroeder reaffirming our
                        continuing desire to achieve an <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> agreement;</p>
                    <p>2. Public reaffirmation of this by the President or Secretary or both;</p>
                    <p>3. An approach to the British stressing the importance we attach to a
                        successful outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> talks,
                        which would permit convening a Ministerial meeting. In this connection we
                        should, I believe, <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0202"/>make it clear to
                        the British that we and the Germans are not prepared to accept the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> without radical change in the direction of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The impression is given here that
                        the British think they have already won and, with our acquiescence, are
                        merely waiting for the Germans to throw in the sponge.</p>
                    <p>4. Advice I can give the Germans with respect to their forthcoming
                        discussions with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Dear Gerhard:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> will probably
                        have reported to you the conversation we had on January 7 which touched,
                        among other things, on the future of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d67fn5">footnote 5, Document 67</ref>.</note> As I stressed to him, our
                        views have not changed. However, because of the misinterpretation which
                        appears to have gained currency on the United States position, I thought I
                        should supplement my talk with the Ambassador with a direct message to you
                        setting forth, as candidly as possible, the way we see the situation on the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> at this juncture.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> believes that at
                        this point in the development of plans for restructuring the nuclear
                        organization of the Alliance, the United States should conduct itself so
                        that what emerges will truly represent the views of the major potential
                        European participants and cannot plausibly be challenged as resulting from
                        United States pressure upon unwilling European allies.</p>
                    <p>Congressional and public support for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        will depend crucially upon the attitude of our principal allies and upon the
                        question as to <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0203"/>whether it would
                        divide or strengthen the Alliance. We are prepared to move ahead without
                        France, but I know that neither you nor we want to move ahead on a bilateral
                        basis. Drawing Britain and Italy into the party becomes, therefore, quite
                        important.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, indications as to the President's position appear to have been
                        viewed by some as meaning that there has been a fundamental shift in United
                        States policy, if not a loss of interest on the part of the United States in
                        the problems the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was designed to deal
                        with. I can assure you this is not the case. On the contrary, I believe that
                        our position reflects the logical continuity of the policy we have
                        pursued.</p>
                    <p>We continue to attach great importance to the objectives which can be served
                        by new nuclear arrangements in NATO: to strengthen and rationalize, on an
                        Atlantic basis, the organization of the Alliance's nuclear effort; to
                        provide a means for the principal non-nuclear powers to share, in a
                        significant and effective way, the responsibility for their own nuclear
                        defense, and to do this in a way which does not contravene, but rather
                        reinforces the principle of non-proliferation, which we feel is becoming
                        ever more important.</p>
                    <p>In pursuing these ends, it is vital to find the means which meet the needs
                        and aspirations of the greatest number, and particularly of the largest
                        members of the Alliance. For some years, in response to Europe's desire for
                        a changed organization in the nuclear field, we have sought specific
                        European suggestions for dealing with the nuclear problem. We ourselves
                        suggested the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as one possible
                        approach.</p>
                    <p>The British Government has now come up with an approach which we believe can,
                        through negotiation, be accommodated to the principles we have been
                        advocating in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In fact, in our view
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposals can leave room for the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> substantially as it was initially
                        conceived. Moreover, a broader nuclear rearrangement, such as the British
                        propose, introduces a new and important dimension in creating the
                        possibility of the United Kingdom's divesting itself of its independent
                        nuclear deterrent—the first step which will ever have been taken away from
                        the direction of proliferation. There are, certainly, unresolved problems
                        raised by the British ideas, and the United States has set forth its
                        comments on these in its December 8 paper.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Attachment to <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note> These
                        comments continue to reflect United States views, and any report, rumor or
                        impression on the contrary is untrue.</p>
                    <p>The United States strongly hopes that the discussions now in prospect,
                        particularly between Germany and the United Kingdom, will provide a
                        synthesis of views that will make it easier for us to move forward with an
                        arrangement supported by the Federal Republic, as well as the <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0204"/>United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and
                        others. We have told the United Kingdom of the importance we attach to
                        constructive forward movement and of the need for plans to be acceptable to
                        the Federal Republic. While France may not agree to participate in the types
                        of arrangements which are now under consideration, I think we all agree on
                        the need for holding the door open for possible French cooperation with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>As our European partners progress in exploring this subject, in discussions
                        with which we shall be in closest contact, we can jointly decide how we
                        should proceed with the best prospects for success. I want you to know we
                        attach great importance to these discussions, and we very much hope they
                        will be pursued purposefully and with appreciation of the importance of the
                        stakes involved.</p>
                    <p>I hope these comments will help you as a background for the discussions you
                        will be having with the British and Italians, which we see as preliminary to
                        multilateral negotiations which should follow. While it will not seek to
                        force a solution upon allies, it is important that you recognize that the
                        United States is not at all neutral or aloof regarding these talks, and the
                        significance of their successful outcome.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">Printed

                            delivered the letter to Schroeder on January 15 and found him in a “grim
                            mood.” Schroeder read the letter, stated that it was very useful, and
                            expressed his satisfaction that the U.S. position had not changed from
                            that stated in the December 8 paper. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> concluded that the letter was precisely what was
                            required for Schroeder and could not have been better; however, part of
                            the problem was public perception, and <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> argued that the assurances made in the letter
                            should be made public. (Telegram 2610 from Bonn, January 14; Department

                    <p>At his press conference on January 16, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was asked about the status of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. After briefly reviewing the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposal put forward by the British in
                        December, the President stated: “We have made clear to the participating
                        governments that we think it is highly important to develop arrangements
                        within the alliance that will provide an opportunity for the nonnuclear
                        members to participate in their own nuclear defense while avoiding the
                        spread of national nuclear systems.” He “strongly” hoped that progress would
                        be made to “allow us to move on to fruitful multilateral discussions.” For

                    <p>2643. Subject: Meeting with Erhard. In my one and a half hour meeting late
                        today with Chancellor Erhard, on the eve of his visit with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> at Rambouillet on Jan. 20, he
                        dispelled any question that might have arisen that any serious
                        misunderstanding existed between him and us—or any apprehension we might
                        have had about how he would conduct himself during the meeting.</p>
                    <p>1) <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor opened by asking the interpreter to read an extract from the
                        speech he had made in Berlin on January 12. “Soviet medium range rockets on
                        the boundaries of this country are a reality. We have never demanded control
                        over nuclear weapons, but we desire to be defended with the same weapons as
                        threaten us. One may discuss the form or purpose of various possible
                        organizations. The political and military reality, however, remains
                        unchanged. We have therefore stated ourselves to be prepared—also because we
                        feel threatened perhaps more than any other country in Europe—to carry our
                        share of burdens and responsibilities.” This, he said, was his reply to
                        those who questioned his determination to proceed with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>It was, moreover, not just a question of the British, with whom he was
                        prepared to negotiate next week, but also of the Italians and Dutch. Their
                        views must be fully considered so that they will be willing to come along.
                        He was also interested in the time element. As I knew, the Bundestag would
                        recess on July 1 for the elections. There was in fact not sufficient time
                        remaining for it to approve the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He
                        would like, moreover, to prevent the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, as
                        a result of being a daily subject of conversation, from becoming an “apple
                        of discord” during the campaign. He agrees with the President that the time
                        element is not so important. However, the finalization of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should not be delayed unduly.</p>
                    <p>2) Basis for meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>With respect to his forthcoming meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, he did not expect the General to raise any serious
                        issues. He does not believe that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> wants to sever France's friendship with Germany. He
                        would be guided in the meeting by the following principles, which had been
                        agreed to by the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Party meeting in
                        Berlin. First, the Alliance must never renounce its integrated structure.
                        Second, Germany cannot, will <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>not
                        and must not renounce the nuclear protection of the U.S. Third, no matter
                        who raises the issue, he will never question the need for the continued
                        presence of US forces in Germany.</p>
                    <p>3) NATO </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked what we thought could be proposed regarding the
                        reorganization of NATO which would be acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. I replied that I know of nothing
                        that would satisfy General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                        in his present attitude, that would also be acceptable to us. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has removed most of the French
                        members of the NATO staff, has withdrawn his naval forces, is against an
                        integrated command structure, has opposed strategic planning in the
                        Alliance, opposes incorporating the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the Alliance, and
                        indeed has indicated that he wishes to withdraw from NATO—not the
                        Alliance—in 1969. I was unaware of any proposal of a positive nature that de
                        Gaulle had ever made concerning the reorganization of the NATO. Perhaps the
                        Chancellor could elicit such a proposal during his forthcoming meeting.</p>
                    <p>4) European political unity</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor observed that both Presidents Kennedy and
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> had urged Europe to unite—that a united
                        Europe would be easier for the US to deal with rather than separate
                        countries. He was not sure, but he hoped during his forthcoming meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to move him to
                        encourage increased political ties in Europe. He commented on the reference
                        he had made to this question in his speech in Berlin. “What is important is
                        that we be aware of and unified on the basic principles of how Europe should
                        be brought together: Europe must embody a democratic form and must involve
                        democratic responsibility.” What would be the US position if he and de
                        Gaulle made progress in this regard?</p>
                    <p>I replied that the US had consistently supported European unity efforts which
                        will enable Europe to play its true role in an Atlantic partnership,
                        contribute to an effective NATO, be open to other eligible countries and not
                        diminish the progress made in the Community. We assumed that this meant the
                        ultimate development of supra-national institutions, however, this did not
                        now seem feasible in the light of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s position. We had studied carefully the German
                        political unity proposals and considered that, in the light of the realities
                        of the present situation, they represent as good a proposal as could be
                        made. Although we did not wish to give them the “kiss of death” with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> by approving them
                        publicly, we wished him success in his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on this point.</p>
                    <p>5) Future of the Alliance</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor interjected at this point that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> seemed to draw a distinction between NATO as an
                        organization and the Atlantic Alliance. It had been proposed (I am not quite
                        sure he said actually by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>)
                        that the present form of the Alliance might be succeeded by one <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0207"/>starting with the European countries alone.
                        Another alliance might then be negotiated between this Alliance and the US.
                        I replied that this did not seem feasible and would not, I believed, be
                        acceptable to us. An old-fashioned alliance including a number of European
                        states and depending on unanimity for action would be an unwieldy partner
                        for us to deal with. Until real political unity could be achieved, and
                        Europe could speak with one voice, I was sure that we would not be willing
                        to forego our present direct relationships with the individual European
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>6) Nuclear coordination</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked whether it might not be possible to work out some form
                        of coordination between France's force de frappe and the other Allied
                        nuclear forces, i.e. <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. I
                        replied that although we had every indication that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would never agree to participate
                        in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, French <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> Messmer had indicated to SecDef <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> an ultimate willingness to
                        coordinate in some way the planning and targeting of the force de frappe
                        with our Strategic Air Command. Perhaps some way could be found, either
                        directly or indirectly, of coordinating it also with the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He
                        might wish to sound out <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on
                        this question during his discussions. The Chancellor asked me when the force
                        de frappe would be ready and particularly when the land-based and seaborne
                        missiles which the French indicated they were developing would be ready. I
                        replied that to the best of my knowledge the force de frappe itself,
                        although not yet operational, would be by 1967. However, there would be no
                        missiles ready until after 1970. In response to his question I assured the
                        Chancellor that the Polaris missiles which we had proposed for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had already been developed and could be
                        ready in 1967.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor speculated that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> might, in his eagerness to develop his force de frappe
                        quickly, ask for German assistance, say for the non-nuclear part. Might
                        Germany not say that she would be willing to help if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would integrate his force with
                        the other NATO nuclear forces? Under such circumstances it might still
                        remain French. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had never given any impression that he would be
                        willing to turn over control of his nuclear forces to anyone else—to the
                        extent which would be required to justify outside assistance. If the force
                        de frappe could really be integrated into the NATO as was proposed for the
                        component parts of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, this might be worth
                        considering; however, it did not appear realistic in light of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s attitude in the past.</p>
                    <p>7) President Johnson's visit to Europe</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then turned to the question of President Johnson's proposed
                        visit to Europe. I replied that although I did not know when this would take
                        place and what the itinerary would be, I assumed that Bonn would of course
                        be included. The President had stated in his State <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"/>of the Union message<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">For text of the President's State of the Union Address,
                            January 4, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                            Lyndon B. Johnson, 1965, Book I, pp. 1–9.</note> that he would be
                        returning this year the visits of various European leaders. The Chancellor
                        then referred to rumors he had heard that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> would insist on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> making a separate visit to Paris. This, he thought,
                        would be most unfortunate. It would create for him a very difficult
                        situation. He would have no objection to the President starting a tour of
                        several countries in Paris, out of deference to de Gaulle. When I queried on
                        a purely hypothetical basis, he said that although less desirable he could
                        live with the President making a separate visit to Paris after a prior visit
                        to several other capitals, including Bonn. However, he did not think the
                        President should visit Paris alone first.</p>
                    <p>8) Reunification initiative</p>
                    <p>I referred to the report that the German Cabinet had in Berlin decided on a
                        new reunification initiative. I recalled the background of recent events
                        affecting this issue. Since the real problem for the Germans appeared to lie
                        with the French, i.e., Couve <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">de
                            Murville</persName> had blocked the reunification initiative agreement
                        among the four at the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting in Paris,
                        I suggested that he take this matter up in his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The Chancellor replied that he
                        believes that France will agree to an initiative. He said he “lived on the
                        earth” and has no undue expectations of what can be obtained from an
                        initiative. The Germans must not, however, agree to give up a whole list of
                        things in return for unification and then find that there is no
                        reunification. I commented that although the Secretary of State has made
                        clear that we expected any new initiative to be a serious one, and that the
                        necessary area of agreement must be found between the four before it is put
                        forward, we did not expect a firm position in advance on all of the
                        questions that would ultimately have to be decided. When the Germans had
                        concluded what form of initiative they wished to put forward, we would be
                        glad to join in giving consideration to it on a four power basis.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion:</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he wanted me to assure the President that he would
                        be very careful in his discussion with de Gaulle, not just because of the
                        repercussions it would have in Germany but for the effect it would have on
                        German relations with the US. He would do what he could to preserve
                        French-German friendship, which he considered—and assumed we considered—a
                        valuable asset. Germany could help smooth relations between France and the
                        other Common Market countries.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor referred to the recent meeting between German Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> and President Johnson.
                        He appreciated greatly <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0209"/>the
                        assurances that the President had given. For his part he warmly reciprocated
                        them. “Nothing has changed in the German position.” He values his “personal
                        friendship with the President” and assured us of “Germany's continued
                        commitment to the US.” Indeed, Germany would like to consider itself “our
                        most faithful ally.”</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he was
                        worried about the outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, and he would not be surprised if the result is a
                        further step along the lines of the Fouchet Plan. The Netherlands is not
                        very enthusiastic about the German proposals. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> has made known to the Dutch Parliament that he does not
                        favor the creation of a defense organ among the Six, since this could be a
                        first move in a drift away from NATO. <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> had agreed with this point when they discussed it in
                        Paris. However, if Piccioni becomes Foreign Minister in Italy, <persName corresp="#p_CA9">Cattani</persName>'s views on the subject will prevail,
                        and he is “all for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.” Also,
                        since <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> has changed his position
                        substantially in order to get agreement with France, the Netherlands is now
                        practically isolated.</p>
                    <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0210"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> had
                        any explanation for the drift in NATO toward preoccupation with trivial
                        irritations, such as the contretemps about the Quadripartite communique in
                        December and the difficulties about <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s trip to Paris. This trend gave us much concern.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said this was partly due to
                        frustration but also to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        methods. France had no enthusiasm for <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and was always trying to weaken him. With
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> it is a question of not
                        knowing what he will do next. Recently there was a headline in a major Dutch
                        paper reading: “<persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> rebuffed in Washington.” This
                        story came out of Paris and was printed even though his (<persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>') talk with the Secretary had not even
                        taken place.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, the Secretary said that
                        important elements in the U.S. will want to know that whatever emerges from
                        the present discussions on this subject represents something Europe—with the
                        exception of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>—wants.
                        Otherwise it will not have much chance. Some are worried about the effect of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> on our relations with France, some
                        about its effect on disarmament and East-West relations, and some are
                        concerned about the size of the German role. These difficulties could be
                        handled if the other participants make clear that this is something they
                        want and which meets their problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said there is a malaise in Europe
                        about this question, which had been discussed at a recent Dutch Cabinet
                        meeting where concern was expressed about the impression of US
                        “disinterest.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there had been a period of two or three weeks of extreme
                        uneasiness in Germany, which we now thought was subsiding. We sensed a
                        greater UK interest now in making progress on the nuclear question than had
                        been evident during the NATO meeting. We hope that the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> discussion will move the matter forward. Luns said
                        that there was an impression that the prospects for success had changed. He
                        recounted a talk with the German observer at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who insisted the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was
                        “completely dead.” He had noted the President's statement yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d68fn4">footnote 4,
                            Document 68</ref>.</note> and he now understood that
                        US interest was unabated and continued strong. He personally had veered from
                        his initial position on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to become a
                        supporter, but there were still divisions in the Netherlands. The Minister
                        of Defense was concerned that the financing arrangements not result in a
                        setback for the Dutch naval program.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> asked our views on the time
                        schedule for future discussion. The Secretary said we should look at this
                        after the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> talks. We did not want a big
                        publicized Ministerial Meeting without some prior indication it can succeed.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> seemed to have relaxed
                        somewhat on timing, and it now appears less likely that the Germans will
                        insist on action before the election. However, it is still important that
                        substantial <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0211"/>progress be made before
                        then or possible alternatives to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        will be debated during the campaign. We had become concerned about the new
                        idea in Germany that non-proliferation should be reserved as a card for
                        talks on reunification.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he was confused about
                        the French “game” in this area. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                        had insisted that Germany cannot under any circumstances be allowed a
                        nuclear force, but on the other hand says that nothing can be done about
                        nuclear proliferation, which is inevitable. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> says that the US invented the possibility of German
                        independence in this field by talking about it. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>, however, recalled the between-the-wars history of the
                        question of German rearmament. He had recently pointed out to the Soviet
                        Ambassador that it was a mistake to view the alternatives as the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or the status quo.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> recalled that the Dutch had urged
                        a full <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion of this question. He
                        had given this further thought in the light of the negative US, German and
                        French reaction, and does not intend to press this subject. The Secretary
                        said we thought there should be discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> at some later stage, after the views of potential
                        participants have become more precise as a result of the present stage of
                        bilateral talks.</p>

                        resulted only in temporary informal arrangement for NATO Headquarters on
                        island and reached no conclusion on ultimate form of Maltese political link
                        to NATO, if any.</p>
                    <p>We are not aware that Borg Olivier is seriously embarrassed now by presence
                        of Headquarters and lack of NATO relationship. However, <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0212"/>ambiguous situation can be exploited by
                        Mintoff and very likely become issue this autumn when election campaign
                        expected to get underway.</p>
                    <p>Although there is no immediate emergency, it is only temporary lull of which
                        NATO should take advantage. <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions
                        last autumn showed how confused and futile these can be in face of
                        deadlines. They demonstrated also that there is no unanimity among NATO
                        countries on Malta and considerable inclination to let matter drift.</p>
                    <p>Our view of Western interest in area has not changed since last August (see
                            <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 267).<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">See <ref target="#d31fn2">footnote 2, Document 31</ref>.</note> We hope
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will reach consensus favorable to
                        retention NATO Headquarters through some form of association with Malta. If
                        made within reasonably early time, favorable decision would: (1) enhance
                        Malta's link with West; (2) enable Borg Olivier to counter his critics; (3)
                        forestall insistence on unrealistic demands on <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> or opposition—which could lead to hostile impasse. Although
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion may not initially be
                        productive, we think Malta-NATO relationship should be result of thoughtful
                        and careful decision by Alliance members.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, if you think these comments persuasive, we suggest you encourage

                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed at Rambouillet to resume talks on political
                        union. With the Common Market's grain price issue resolved <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0213"/>and the pace of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> negotiations altered,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> evidently feels
                        emboldened to move now in the political field which, he said in Strasbourg
                        on November 22, “is first of all the field of defense.”</p>
                    <p>Previous Political Union Treaty negotiations—notably the Fouchet-<persName corresp="#p_CA9">Cattani</persName> negotiations of 1961–62—foundered on
                        several key issues: British participation; federal vs. confederal forms and
                        possibilities for evolution; and the competence of a political union in
                        economic and defense matters, in view of the concern constantly expressed by
                        all but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that neither NATO
                        nor the European Communities should be weakened.</p>
                    <p>Proposals advanced late last year by Spaak, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName>
                        manage with uneven success to skirt these and other once-crucial questions.
                        All of the 1964 proposals envisage a pre-treaty consultative stage. Their
                        starting points, except for the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                        notion of an independent “wise men” group, are essentially confederal, and
                        their emphasis is on gradual progress. Of these, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s plan, with its generally inoffensive blueprint for
                        slow movement toward political union (including defense) and strong call for
                        strengthening the existing European Communities, probably offers the least
                        controversial basis for a resumption of discussions. The Italian proposal,
                        while generally less promising than <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s, except as regards an important role for the
                        European Parliament, is also less precise on defense. In both respects it
                        could be helpful to the other Five in standing up to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> apparently envisage a Foreign Ministers meeting of
                        the Six this spring after a round of preparatory work at the senior official
                        level (<persName corresp="#p_CA9">Cattani</persName>). If all goes well,
                        there would be a “European summit” discussion during the summer. This could
                        be explosive, especially if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        sniffs any possibility in the defense field of heading off the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We must now deal with the situation in the light of two relatively new
                        elements. First, there is the French attack on NATO which—if we accept what
                        they say—is to be followed by their withdrawal from the organization in
                        1969. Second, there is the nuclear issue, particularly the October reversal
                        of the French position on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. This suggests
                        that defense policy may be more of a stumbling block to progress on
                        political unity than had been assumed even in 1964. It also suggests that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> can, if he wishes, use
                        the nuclear issue as a bargaining counter to gain acceptance of his views on
                        political unity.</p>
                    <p>European political unity poses an acute dilemma for the “good Europeans.” On
                        the one hand, and for a variety of reasons, some (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CA9">Cattani</persName> and
                        occasionally Spaak) feel that an initiative no matter how insubstantial is
                        necessary to maintain momentum. On the other hand, another group who are in
                        substantial agreement with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CA9">Cattani</persName> on the end objective and
                        in opposition to Gaullist views (for instance, <persName corresp="#p_HW5">

                        practically all Dutchmen and probably <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>), feel an initiative at this juncture would not
                        only be futile but could in fact lead to erosion of the progress toward
                        unity that has been made over the last fifteen years. This latter group
                        would concentrate for the time being on strengthening the economic
                        community.</p>
                    <p>The Five are of course struggling with a basic contradiction, namely, how to
                        reconcile the irreconcilable. They are for a degree of supranationality, the
                        French are flatly against it; they want a federal structure, which the
                        French oppose; they want to build institutions, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wants to weaken the existing bodies and wishes to
                        place the emphasis on policy agreements as a precondition to organizational
                        arrangements; finally, the Five want a community open to the membership of
                        others, which the French oppose.</p>
                    <p>It remains our task to avoid the accusation of involving ourselves as a
                        participant in such sensitive and involved internal European affairs. But at
                        the same time the impact on our own interests of the decisions the Europeans
                        arrive at will be substantial. The Five nations are working for solutions
                        which they see as protecting their own and our interests. It should not be
                        beyond our competence to make our weight felt by appropriate and unobtrusive
                        means on the side of those who are working toward the kind of European unity
                        which is favorable to our national interests and to the kind of Atlantic
                        relationship we want. It would be unfortunate and contrary to our own
                        objectives if in avoidance of direct involvement the “good Europeans” were
                        to construe the U.S. attitude as indifference to their goal of working
                        towards an integrated Europe in close partnership with the United
                        States.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Concerns</p>
                    <p>We have maintained a public posture of sympathetic interest in European
                        political union but have generally withheld approbation or disapproval of
                        specific plans. This has usually taken the form of comments like the
                        Secretary's of September 10, 1964 that “the organization of Europe …is a
                        European problem.” We were mildly taken with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s initiative, essentially because it came from the
                        Germans and contained an imaginative yet pragmatic scheme for Community
                        progress, and said that it was “a constructive contribution to that
                        achievement of European unification within the framework of Atlantic
                        partnership which has long been and remains a central objective of United
                        States foreign policy.” There was no need for an official reaction to
                        Spaak's suggestions, and our reactions to the Italian plan were never
                        solicited.</p>
                    <p>When asked by the Six, the UK and others with some interest in the question,
                        however, we have expressed our preoccupations more frankly. These
                        preoccupations, briefly, are that we would be concerned if any such
                        negotiations weakened rather than strengthened NATO, were to lead to an
                        inward-oriented “small Europe” with the characteristic of excluding the
                        British for all time, did not promote European integration by strengthening
                        the existing European Communities, and if they ignored the crucial
                        collateral policy of Atlantic partnership. On the actual form of political
                        union, we have quietly supported generally “federalist” concepts and the
                        democratization of Europe via increased Parliamentary powers, although we
                        have made it clear that the decisions were for Europeans to take.</p>
                    <p>The forthcoming round may be taken more seriously in Europe than any previous
                        activity in this field. Our reactions will be solicited and our public
                        statements carefully appraised. An especially sharp eye will be fixed on our
                        reaction to the French aim of keeping defense affairs in the foreground,
                        with the clear objective of frustrating the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> idea.</p>
                    <p>On their merits, the several plans aired to date add up to warmed-over
                        Fouchet. There will doubtless be others. We must exercise care in commenting
                        publicly and privately, but the organization of the Atlantic area is too
                        important for us to appear to be indifferent to the outcome.</p>
                    <p>Viewed in retrospect, our general endorsement of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> effort was just about right. It kept
                        us aloof from the actual form and direction of political union while putting
                        us on record as favoring further progress toward European integration. Here
                        we are for the moment on solid ground. If only because of its
                        comprehensiveness, the Erhard Plan will have to be taken most seriously by
                        the Six and would probably be first on the agenda. In the present European
                        atmosphere, it also provides a sensible, <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0216"/>common denominator basis for discussion. The French would
                        have a difficult job trying to subtract very much from it, and the
                        Netherlands and Belgium might be able to give it more substance.</p>
                    <p>Our main concern at the start of the 1965 phase should properly be over the
                        defense factor. Here the Italian formulation suggesting discussion on
                        defense matters when necessary may provide pro-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> elements ammunition for stalling <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. When it becomes feasible to do
                        so, we should not hesitate to express our serious apprehension over any
                        serious trend toward <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        approach.</p>

                    <p>1443. 1. We are concerned over press stories (most recently NY Times
                        international edition January 20) reporting US–<gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> “alliance” and implying changed US policy toward <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Pattern of stories indicates they may have
                        been planted as part coordinated campaign. Although lacking confirmation, we
                        have reason to believe one source may have been <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> Information Office Geneva, whose new chief is imaginative,
                        experienced publicist. We do not believe stories serve either our interests
                        or those of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>2. “Alliance” is reportedly based on mutual desire of US and <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries for successful Kennedy Round.
                        We appreciate that this mutual desire exists and, in fact, it may be
                        necessary as tactical measure for US and <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries to isolate <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        on some issues, like disparities, on which success of Kennedy Round depends.
                        However, any implication this tacit cooperation being formalized into
                        “alliance” can only serve to defeat common objective which we share. It has
                        effect of bolstering strength of minority in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> which sees Kennedy Round as attempt to undermine <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> cohesion by dismantling <gloss target="#t_CXT1">CXT</gloss>. Moreover some Europeans, such as <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> and Monnet, have been most vocal
                        in support of <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0217"/>Kennedy Round
                        precisely because they see problem in political terms of US–<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> relation. Our theme has been and must
                        remain that trade liberalization possible through Kennedy Round will benefit
                        all participants. We must carefully avoid presentation of Kennedy Round as
                        attempt by US and <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries to gang up
                        on <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to these vital economic considerations, there is no political
                        basis for reports. We regard <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> as nucleus
                        united Europe, which we support for sake European stability and Atlantic
                        partnership. “Partnership” implies give-and-take relationship with
                        inevitable disputes and differences of opinion. <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> observers and others should not be led to make mistake of
                        interpreting these differences as evidence of changed US policy toward
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>I have discussed with the President the proposal in your memorandum of

                        the more modest alternative which you and I talked about on the
                        phone—namely, oral messages to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President believes that neither <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is
                        in any doubt as to his own basic position, and he thinks it is also very
                        clear that <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>unless the situation
                        changes sharply as a result of the meeting in Bonn, it is very unlikely that
                        there will be any prospect of agreement before the German elections. In this
                        situation he thinks it is better to wait and hear what happens between
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Let me add, as a personal view, that I wonder whether we should not ask
                        ourselves a few hard questions about the whole <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept before we agree to any serious multilateral
                        discussion this spring and summer. I favor such discussions, but my own
                        growing conviction is that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as such
                        is never going to be the right next step for the necessary number of nations
                        all at the same time—at least not until we have made progress in some other
                        way first. I therefore wonder if we should be giving close thought to other
                        possibilities for nuclear coordination within the Alliance which may be more
                        modest but which are also more likely to happen. I have mentioned this
                        personal view to the President, and he has suggested that I raise it with
                        you and Bob McNamara and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>
                        for discussion.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">On March 4, <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> told British Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Michael Stewart</persName> that the President had

                    <p>Here are some brief impressions of a very frank luncheon discussion with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Patrick Gordon Walker</persName> in a small
                        group at the Council on Foreign Relations today:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">ANF/MLF</hi>. GW dismissed any prospects of reaching
                        agreement. He said that we had killed and buried not only the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> but the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>
                        by <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0219"/>the position we had taken since
                        December. He said the only hope would have been for us to continue to press
                        the Germans, instead of which we had told the Europeans that they should
                        work things out among themselves. This they were incapable of doing, and it
                        was clear that Erhard was not about to do anything which would expose him to
                        pressure from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He said that
                        Germany would finally have to choose between <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and the United States, and that unless we held the
                        German feet to the fire on this issue, we would be conceding the victory to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He said that the
                        current <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> talks in Bonn would lead nowhere.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows numbered paragraph 2, in which <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> recorded <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Gordon
                            Walker</persName>'s comments on U.S. efforts to preserve order in
                        Africa.]</p>

                        </hi>. GW said that there was no doubt that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was going to reduce the UK troops in Germany. He developed
                        a purely military rationale for this in terms of free world security
                        requirements east of Suez. I raised the political factor, which he evidently
                        found inconvenient and brushed aside. In general, his comments about the UK
                        role with regard to Europe were (to me at least) disconcertingly
                        irresponsible: “We are certainly not going to go on keeping huge forces on
                        the continent of Europe,” he said, and added by way of explanation that to
                        do so would be in conflict with British policy over the last four hundred
                        years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I had the impression that the other people
                        present at lunch (including Bob Murphy, Dick Neustadt, Ben Moore, Phil
                        Mosely and Bob Blum) were rather put out by a certain overtone of sarcasm
                        and flipness in GW's approach to these rather weighty matters.</p>
                    <p> GW told me how much he had enjoyed and appreciated his talk with you in
                        Cleveland, and I wonder whether he talked to you at all in the same vein as
                        he did today. I rather fancy that today may have been a case of misjudging
                        his audience, but if he reflected the inwardness of the Labor Government
                        attitude on foreign affairs it is rather depressing.</p>

                    <p>When we last spoke on the telephone, I said that I would let you know how I
                        got on during my visit to Berlin and Bonn which has just taken place.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> visited Germany March
                            6–9.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As it turned out, it was a very good thing that my trip should have started
                        with the visit to Berlin. This enabled me to make an act of presence in the
                        city and to make a speech re-affirming British determination, together with
                        our allies, to safeguard the freedom of the city. The demonstration and the
                        speech acted as a useful curtain raiser and set the tone for my subsequent
                        talks in Bonn with the Federal Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>My talks with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> covered four main
                        points:</p>
                    <p>(1) The nuclear organization of the Alliance</p>
                    <p>(2) Reunification</p>
                    <p>(3) European problems including measures to improve the cohesion of the
                        continent and bring <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> closer together and</p>
                    <p>(4) The offset agreement</p>
                    <p>In addition I had a private session with him, as between two retired or
                        reformed economists, on the British economic situation. This gave a chance
                        for me to say what I thought about Rueff and all his works and for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to say that he totally disagreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> about the gold
                        standard. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> indicated clearly,
                        without actually committing himself, that we could expect German support
                        when we apply for our fund drawing later in the year.</p>
                    <p>As to nuclear matters, it soon became very clear that whatever Shroeder's
                        views might be, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was not going
                        to have anything to do with nuclear matters this side of the German
                        elections. It is clear that the only way that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> can preserve his relationship with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and the unity of his party is by
                        putting nuclear matters on ice for the time being. When I told <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that I assumed he wanted the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> to
                        be a sort of sleeping beauty he did not disagree. The wording in the
                            communique<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> communique, March 9, see <hi rend="italic">Europa

                            D 167–168.</note> represents the compromise between the British desire
                        not to lose momentum and the German wish to forget about it for the time
                        being. I would judge that there is no progress to be made on this until
                        after the German elections.</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0221"/>
                    <p>The one thing that the Germans were really interested in, again for electoral
                        reasons, was some demonstration of public activity to which they could point
                        on the re-unification front. I made it quite clear that, in practical terms,
                        re-unification can only come as a result of a period of detente with the
                        Soviet Union and could not be made a condition for detente: and in agreeing
                        to remit the matter to the Ambassadorial Group, I was careful not to commit
                        myself to any specific project. Although the Germans would like progress in
                        time for the NATO Ministerial Meeting in May, they may be able to live with
                        a minimum of demonstrable activity on the subject with their Western
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>On the economic organization of Europe, I found <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> equally concerned as I was myself to prevent the
                        further division of Europe by allowing the gulf between the Common Market
                        and <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> to widen. He is a strong proponent
                        of liberal outward-looking policies, and, privately, indicated that as an
                        economist, he did not think much of the present agricultural arrangements of
                        the Common Market. It was however a price that had to be paid. I am myself
                        instituting a study here of ways and means of mitigating the effect of
                        present divisions and hope to come up with some useful ideas.</p>
                    <p>We had some very tough sessions on the offset agreement but since you have
                        yourselves virtually equipped the German armed forces, there does not seem
                        to be much for us in that line. However <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> undertook to issue a directive to his people to try
                        harder and the fact of the directive was written into the communique. We
                        shall give them a couple of months and then if necessary send the chief
                        secretary, who is a very tough character, back to Bonn to re-negotiate the
                        whole process. We left the Germans in no doubt that if we did not get
                        satisfaction on this point, we should be forced to agonizing
                        re-appraisals.</p>
                    <p>All in all the talks were tough but constructive. The visit was well
                        worthwhile and has, I hope, generated the right sort of atmosphere for the
                        Queen's state visit in May.</p>

                    <p>The President made the following specific points:</p>
                    <p>—Despite the apparent U.S. preoccupation with currently acute problems, the
                        United States has not lost interest in the Atlantic World and continues to
                        be committed to the goal of European integration. Our policy has not changed
                        since the Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>—The U.S. has a continuing concern that Europe remain open and
                        Atlantic-minded. The President particularly emphasized the importance of a
                        successful Kennedy Round, with liberalization both in industry and
                        agriculture. He hoped that the Commission would give the Six and Europe a
                        strong and constructive lead in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—The President has a strong interest in expanding peaceful trade with Eastern
                        Europe and the Soviets as an important part of his policy of
                        bridge-building.</p>
                    <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0223"/>
                    <p>—We are determined to fix our balance of payments; there should be no doubt
                        of the fundamental strength of the dollar. In the interim, we intend to be
                        fairly tough about overseas capital investment. (The President made special
                        mention of our large trade surplus, indicating that the problem has to do
                        with our worldwide responsibilities and the capital account.)</p>
                    <p>—On Atlantic nuclear matters, we will continue working for constructive
                        arrangements without trying to impose any particular scheme on a reluctant
                        Europe. The President expressed gratitude for Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s wisdom on this matter and also on
                        other matters of joint concern. He indicated that we shall be prepared to
                        move forward in cooperation with our partners as soon as Europe seems ready,
                        perhaps in the period following the German elections, and that he is
                        reasonably optimistic that the British, after they settle down, will help to
                        work out a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> thanked the President for
                        his views, especially on unification and partnership, sketched for the
                        President the recent progress of the Community (merger, agricultural
                        package) and promised that the Commission would do all it could to advance
                        the Kennedy Round.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">On March 29, <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Jean Rey</persName> also visited Washington. Memoranda of his

                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that in
                        view of the current German attitude toward the problem, the UK is prepared
                        to propose in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> that the Working Group
                        resume its work in Paris and that all those interested be invited to
                        participate (having in mind Canadian interest). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that the Working Group should
                        take into account work already done as well as the British <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposals. He also referred to the NATO
                        Secretary General's idea of dealing with the nuclear problem in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. The Secretary expressed doubt that
                        discussion in the full Council would advance the matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said that the Secretary General might
                        make a bland statement simply announcing the meeting of the Working Group
                        but not opening the subject to discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that the Germans are
                        ready for resumed discussions provided that no conclusions are reached
                        before their September election.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold</persName> said that perhaps at the
                        first meeting officials might attend from those capitals wishing to send
                        them. My <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> commented that perhaps
                        the Germans would consider this as giving too much prominence to the
                        exercise. The Foreign Secretary said that there did not appear to be much
                        progress as yet in closing the gap between the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Sir <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold</persName> referred to the obvious differences
                        of opinion within the German Government and the absence of a coordinated
                        German position.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0225"/>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, Mr. Henderson said that there
                        had been some modifications in the British <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposals since Christmas but no radical changes. He said
                        that these proposed modifications had been given to the Germans and Italians
                        as well as to us.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary indicated concern that the Germans would want to have
                        as little discussion of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> as possible in
                        the Working Group and instead would wish to emphasize the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> proposals. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>'s question, he said that in the
                        British view the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> in effect replaces the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we are frankly disappointed in the response to our
                        efforts of the past five years to meet what we understood to be a European
                        need in the nuclear field. We have tried to work something out in the
                        Alliance to satisfy this need but have not had much success in finding a
                        consensus among our allies. There have been complaints about our alleged
                        failure to exercise leadership but the critics generally want us to lead the
                        other fellow. We feel that we were led down the garden path by our friends
                        in Paris. Up to four or five months ago France took the position that while
                        it did not wish to participate it was not opposed to others doing so. Now,
                        however, France has assumed the role of active opposition. We are not
                        disinterested nor resigned but consider that we must know what will meet
                        European requirements. We are prepared to pursue the matter in the Working
                        Group to see if the consensus will emerge. The Foreign Secretary commented
                        that the discussions in the Working Group should be as lively as German
                        reluctance will permit. He reiterated his earlier comment that the Germans
                        should be prevented from pressing the talks back to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I have studied with interest your speech of March 6 before the Council on
                        Foreign Relations in Cleveland.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">For text of
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s address on Atlantic
                            policy, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March
                            22, 1965, pp. 427–431.</note> One passage which particularly struck me
                        was the reference, in the section on NATO defense, to our receptivity “If
                        the European countries wish to play a larger role, possibly <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0226"/>as a collective entity, in sharing the
                        burdens and responsibilities of NATO defense.” Do I interpret this correctly
                        to mean that we will, at some stage prior to the final achievement of unity,
                        be prepared to accept within NATO the collective organization of European
                        defense—non-nuclear as well as nuclear? Your statement would represent a
                        truism in the event of true European political unity, when Europe must act
                        as one.</p>
                    <p>On the nuclear side, a possible consequence of such an interpretation would
                        appear to be that we would also be willing to consider the creation of an
                        independent European nuclear force prior to the achievement of final
                        political unity. This might come about whenever the uniting nations were
                        able to make the necessary arrangements among themselves to manage such a
                        force. The force might embody what Europe itself could contribute—i.e., the
                        force de frappe and, if the UK were to participate, the UK nuclear forces.
                        If an <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had in the meantime been created, it could also include the
                        collective European share.</p>
                    <p>If we permitted these steps to be taken in advance of unity, we would not
                        only place ourselves clearly on the side of unity but might find that the
                        exercise of building a European nuclear force had contributed powerfully,
                        perhaps decisively, toward achieving unity. This is why I have always
                        attached so much importance to our acceptance, in a forthcoming way, of a
                        good “European clause” in the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> negotiations. If we would make clear now
                        that the way is open to the Europeans to create a European force, French
                        arguments that only their force de frappe could act for Europe would no
                        longer find support.</p>
                    <p>On the conventional side, another possible consequence of your Cleveland
                        speech would appear to be that we would be willing to accept not only the
                        development of a common European defense policy, including strategy, but the
                        creation of a European army. Reconciliation between European and American
                        strategic concepts could probably be more easily accomplished under such
                        circumstances than at present—where there exists a complete impasse on
                        strategy within NATO. There should, moreover, be no particular difficulty in
                        integrating U.S. and European Army representatives at the various NATO
                        command levels—i.e., there is at present of course no actual integration of
                        forces as such nor is this envisaged. Provision might be made for the
                        Commander of the American forces and the Commander of the European forces to
                        rotate as <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. I realize, of course,
                        that this is something for the future, since none of it will be possible
                        until after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In my discussion on March 24 with Jean Monnet, reported to you in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3638,<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Not
                            found.</note> he expressed gratification at the cooperation which has
                        been achieved within the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> in Brussels,
                        which he felt has led to the development of cooperation in the economic
                        field which is truly “European<pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0227"/>”—and
                        which already projects into the political field. Although he does not
                        believe it can be accomplished until after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, he sees as necessary additional steps the development
                        of similar bases for cooperation in the foreign policy and defense fields. I
                        assume him to mean that this could be developed progressively, even before
                        the accomplishment of political unity which would be its ultimate
                        consequence.</p>
                    <p>In the political field this could greatly facilitate our dealing with Europe
                        on bilateral matters. It might also provide the only way to obtain any
                        response to our repeated propositions, which you first made at the Oslo
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting in 1961 and made most
                        recently in your Cleveland speech—that Europeans should help us in facing
                        the problems in the peripheral areas. A Europe even beginning to be united
                        in the foreign policy field might be able to develop common policy toward
                        such problems which could lead to common actions. The present proliferation
                        and contradictions of such policies among the various European countries, on
                        the other hand, almost certainly precludes such common action.</p>
                    <p>As I indicated to you in my memorandum of last December 24,<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4">A copy of this memorandum with an attached 5-page draft
                            paper is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SMF1">S/MF</gloss>
                            Files: Lot 66 D 182.</note> I feel that the burden is on us to convince
                        the Europeans that we are really prepared to see a united Europe which is
                        sovereign in the defense field, including the nuclear field, provided this
                        can be done in a way which is not inconsistent with our basic national
                        security interests. Indeed, if we held the contrary view we could be accused
                        of working against European unification. In my judgment unification will not
                        come about, as an abstract proposition, prior to the development of common
                        foreign and defense policies to supplement existing common economic
                        policies. Unification will, in my judgment, come about only as a consequence
                        of the development of such common policies. Even though progress will
                        undoubtedly be delayed until after de Gaulle it is in our interest, I
                        believe, to encourage now those who are willing to “wait him out”, to prove
                        our willingness to work with a unified Europe if and when they succeed in
                        creating it, and to be sure that our policies and actions in the meantime
                        facilitate where they can, but in no case obstruct, the achievement of
                        unity. Otherwise we could end up athwart the whole historic process of
                        European unity.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate very much any comments you might have on the
                            foregoing.<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">In his April 12 reply, Secretary

                            integrated European forces, but the major steps in this direction had to

                    <p>The Secretary referred to the Prime Minister's reaffirmation earlier in the

                        Europe as a source of strength for NATO and the Atlantic Community.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">A memorandum of the conversation at the White

                            his wish to be of assistance in fostering European unity, but also
                            expressed his desire to avoid telling Europeans how to run their lives,
                            is ibid.</note> The Secretary praised Italian steadfastness in this
                        regard, stating it has proved a constructive and stabilizing influence in
                        Europe's search for greater cohesion. Quoting the Prime Minister as having
                        said a restatement of American support for European unification would be a
                        valuable contribution to this movement, the Secretary called upon Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to outline current American
                        thinking on this important subject.</p>
                    <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0229"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reviewed the reasons why we
                        have encouraged the principle of European unity as a means of assuring a
                        strong, stable, peaceful Europe, with the capability, in an age of
                        interdependency and indivisibility of defense, to play an effective role as
                        an equal partner within the Atlantic Community. He commented on the appeal
                        of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for a more national
                        approach to European problems, which the General dramatized in his press
                        conference of January 1963. Since that time, the drive for European
                        political integration has been checked by Gaullist concepts and tactics.
                        Should they prevail, the achievement of a unified Europe and a dynamic
                        Atlantic Community would be indefinitely postponed. On the positive side,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to the steady but
                        less dramatic progress made in the economic field by the European
                        Communities. This progress may lead eventually to the creation of European
                        institutions needed to make the political decisions arising as a consequence
                        of close economic integration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to the existence of
                        serious Atlantic problems, especially the threat of French withdrawal from
                        NATO or proposals that would radically alter the basic NATO structure in
                        favor of looser and less effective arrangements. He stressed the importance
                        of an eventual solution of the problem of nuclear military sharing in the
                        Atlantic Community, stating that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        proposal had been based on the collective approach. We believe such an
                        approach is the safest as well as an equitable means to avoid proliferations
                        of national weapons programs. Conceding that no real progress is possible in
                        this field until after the German elections, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said a “hard look” at the problem would have to be made
                        in the fall. This delay in the time-table, however, should not be regarded
                        as a slackening of American interest in finding a solution to the problem of
                        mutually satisfactory nuclear arrangements with the Atlantic Community.</p>
                    <p>Concluding his remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        stressed the fact that an effective, strong and closely knit Atlantic
                        Community is premised upon European unity.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated he wished to make several observations. In considering
                        any proposals the French may make for the revision of NATO, possibly even
                        before 1969, it should be kept in mind that NATO has enjoyed freedom from
                        attack only because NATO strength has been able to persuade Eastern Europe
                        that an attack would be suicidal. Secondly, in any alternatives to the NATO
                        countries working together in their common defense, which the United States
                        thinks is the best approach, we will never agree to remaining in an alliance
                        where we would continue to commit armed forces to Europe but where Europe
                        would make military decisions involving these troops independently of the
                        United States. The Secretary admitted there are vital, unavoidable problems
                        before the Alliance that must be considered in an appropriate <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"/>forum and before they become unmanageable.
                        We must all be prepared to probe deeply into these problems and consult each
                        other on our future defenses.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the Italian Government agrees completely with
                        our views, including the vital role of NATO and the necessity of close ties
                        with the United States. The French position has created uncertainties and
                        problems for NATO, which should be vigorously tackled. NATO cannot be left
                        to drift in the hope that things will arrange themselves. Italy will
                        continue to search for solutions since the future of Europe and the world is
                        dependent upon NATO unity.</p>
                    <p>The related question of European unity has also been affected by the French
                        attitude. But Europeans should not become discouraged or falter. They must
                        continue to study the problems and hope that growing economic integration
                        will held lead to unity. Italy has felt that informal consultations such as
                        the proposed Venice meeting would be helpful even though the French have
                        rejected the idea.</p>
                    <p>As for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or some form of common nuclear
                        defense arrangements, the Prime Minister agreed that there can be no real
                        progress until after the German elections. He said he would welcome our
                        views as to whether we should push the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        concept even if it meant great disruption and possible French withdrawal
                        from NATO. He said that despite these prospects and domestic complications
                        reflecting British views and fear of German predominance, the Italian
                        Government accepts the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in principle. It,
                        too, wishes to avoid new national nuclear capabilities, which would also
                        help to allay domestic fears. Nevertheless, the French position should be
                        studied and the repercussions considered since they could be fraught with
                        political and psychological dangers. The Prime Minister wondered if these
                        problems might be profitably considered at the May NATO meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that our trouble with France dates back to our
                        rejection of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        directorate proposal in 1958. We had done so because we could not accept the
                        attempted direction of our other European allies without their consent. Now
                        the General claims it is too late for a common policy and seeks a special
                        position in Europe based on the force de frappe. The United States has
                        overwhelmingly greater nuclear power than the French can ever dream of
                        mustering, yet we do not claim a special position but rather hope for
                        agreement on a common strategy. The Secretary doubted that the forthcoming
                        NATO meeting, before the German elections and a clearer indication of French
                        intentions, would provide much of an opportunity for going into these
                        matters in depth. We have tried to sound out the French as to their specific
                        intentions but so far unsuccessfully. He pointed out that we are not against
                        change in NATO, but we do not yet know what the changes <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"/>might be. We should, however, try to fix
                        our ideas before confronted by a major crisis.</p>
                    <p>As for French hostility to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, our
                        attitude does not depend upon French views, but we recognize the need of a
                        broad consensus of support from the other important members if progress is
                        to be made. The Secretary suggested, therefore, that we remain in close
                        touch on this subject.</p>

                    <p>3289. German Concern over US Views on NATO Strategy. Dept fully agrees with
                        central point <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3887<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">Dated April 7. (Ibid.)</note> that main element of
                        German concern on strategy, of which there have been increasing signs
                        lately, is that in event of all-out Communist attack on central front US
                        would not authorize use of nuclear weapons before aggressors have overrun
                        large area of Germany. Agree also that concepts embodied in “flexible
                        response,” etc., are taken as representing US disinclination to allow use of
                        nuclear weapons to prevent <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> suffering
                        severely. In view of some, US strategic thinking results in reduction
                        deterrent effect Western military posture.</p>
                    <p>We believe these difficulties stem in part from <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s extreme dependence upon US nuclear strength for its
                        security combined with its relatively limited influence over US defense
                        planning, in part from feeling that geographic differences in US and German
                        position inevitably lead to differences in judgment on questions such as
                        timing for use nuclear weapons, and in part from insufficient realization
                        that effectiveness of deterrence very much depends upon demonstrable ability
                        to mount a plausible defense if deterrence were to fail.</p>
                    <p>We have grave doubts that this situation can be substantially improved by
                        further hortatory assurances. New statements of US determination <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>or reiteration present commitments unlikely
                        to contribute basically to easing of German anxieties. Present record
                        already includes following:</p>
                    <p>1. US has, in Athens Guidelines and series of US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> strategy talks, made it clear that US intent is to meet
                        Soviet nuclear attack with nuclear response and to meet massive conventional
                        attack with whatever means necessary to repulse it, including nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s defense plans, which German
                        officers participate in drawing up, accord with this basic concept and are
                        not based on postponing use of nuclear weapons to last possible moment (as
                        Krone suggested is US wish).</p>
                    <p>3. We have told Germans in recent talks that their ideas on question of
                        nuclear weapons in limited zone should be studied carefully in connection
                        with defense planning activities, although we have certainly not signed on
                        to them.</p>
                    <p>4. We have always operated on basis that as objective matter US security is
                        inextricably involved with that of Europe, and that loss of significant
                        portion of European territory to Soviets would so tip balance of power that
                        vital US security interests would be automatically involved.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Fact remains, however, that it is
                        impossible and indeed undesirable, in our view, to define with precision
                        point at which nuclear weapons would be used in various contingencies (and
                        even were we to do so, doubts would probably remain). We recognize our
                        present inability to be absolutely precise either as to use of nuclear
                        weapons in less than all-out attack with nuclear weapons or as to size of
                        conventional option we believe appropriate for NATO, or as to precise
                        changes we would like to see accomplished in present NATO force posture,
                        contributes to fundamental difficulty we have with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Although we recognize US bears a primary responsibility for having initiated
                        debate on strategy, we have come to conclusion that less we argue about
                        abstract strategic question, the better. In our view, it is preferable to
                        concentrate on practical aspects of NATO defense and to deal with underlying
                        reasons for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> anxiety as far as possible.
                        Following are examples:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Defense Planning Activities</hi>. By focusing on
                        concrete questions of NATO defense problem, as in present <gloss target="#t_NFPE1">NFPE</gloss>, we can, over time, hopefully secure a
                        force posture that gives NATO wider range of defense options in Europe. This
                        particularly so since we believe this objective need not entail significant
                        increases in European defense expenditures, which we know will not be
                        forthcoming in present political circumstances. Important improvements can
                        be achieved by rationalization of forces even within present budget levels,
                        giving NATO heads of government substantially greater flexibility in crises
                        in choosing type of force to use in range of situations, all of which are
                        not now foreseeable. Accordingly, <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0233"/>US strongly supports <gloss target="#t_NFPE1">NFPE</gloss> activities,
                        will seek its future strengthening and will in meantime continue to avoid
                        “confrontation” or generalized debate on problems of strategy.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Improved Consultation Procedures</hi>. We hope
                        forthcoming Defense Ministers' meeting will be first of series and, when
                        supplemented by <gloss target="#t_NFPE1">NFPE</gloss> effort and by
                        continued bilateral <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meetings, will
                        lay basis for more intimate and wider-ranging exchanges of views on defense
                        issues among principal Alliance members. This will be helpful in giving
                            <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s common background of
                        information as basis for more convergent perspectives on defense matters. We
                        hope it will be possible to follow up in months ahead on US December 8
                        proposal for restricted <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meetings
                        at which highly sensitive subjects could be thoroughly and frankly
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Sharing</hi>. We continue to view as highly
                        important measures for giving Germans and others confidence that NATO
                        nuclear forces of adequate size are organized, used and deployed according
                        to plans which they have large degree of influence in drawing up. These
                        measures can result in wider sharing of nuclear planning and operating
                        responsibilities and we would hope that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] such wider participation in
                        planning and operating would reduce allied apprehensions re alliance nuclear
                        problems. Present hiatus in <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in no way indicates a reduced US interest
                        in bringing allies more fully into nuclear planning and sharing process. We
                        have solicited allied views on how this process might be given effect and we
                        are ourselves constantly studying particular proposals to this end. However,
                        we anticipate Germans and others will not want to pursue intensive
                        discussions in this area until after September.</p>
                    <p>Dept believes it is in material progress in areas such as these rather than
                        in further repetitions of US avowals to defend Europe that will, in due
                        course, serve as best, and indeed only basis for effectively dealing with
                        underlying German concerns.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, in further effort to meet problem, request your views on
                        desirability of arranging for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to talk with highly selected Germans during visit
                        to Bonn. We would suggest you arrange restricted informal meeting of senior
                        German officials (Luebke, if appropriate, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, Krone, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, et
                        al), at which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        could informally discuss problem as he has done with number of German
                        visitors to Washington. Conceivably Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName> could meet with such group in guise of making report
                        on their May talks. It is our feeling that this kind of authoritative and
                        first-hand account could be far more valuable than many pages of written
                        exegesis.</p>
                    <p>We are also considering whether communique which might be issued after
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> talks should include brief
                        reaffirmation <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0234"/>of US intentions to
                        help defend German territory by all necessary means in event of Communist
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>We are also, as you requested, looking at various public and classified
                        statements issued on this subject, although we feel these statements of
                        policy should be reasonably well know to senior German officials.</p>
                    <p>Request your comments on above suggestions, which are tentative and would
                        receive high-level consideration only if you strongly endorse them.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">On May 4, McGhee replied strongly endorsing the

                    <p>A public attack on or specific refutation of April 27 speech might well have
                        the effect of strengthening rather than weakening the theses propounded. We

                        expect to issue a high level statement on May 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">On May 2, the Department of State asked the Missions in Rome, Paris,

                    <p>We have all been sensitive to the difficult situation confronting the German
                        Government and have attempted to meet their desire to minimize direct
                        confrontations with Paris. We intend to do our best to help the Germans on
                        this score. With this in mind I do not expect to initiate at the London
                        meeting a detailed analysis of the State of the Alliance. However, I believe
                        that we cannot put off such an examination beyond the December Ministerial
                        Meeting. At that time we should take specific actions looking toward
                        modernizing and strengthening NATO. As indicated <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> we would take preliminary step in this direction at
                        London; propounding certain questions for consideration in December and

                        had expressed to the Secretary and me last December,<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">See <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.</note>
                        particularly in regard to timing, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> answered that his views had not changed; that he
                        believed it would be necessary in 1969 to reexamine the North Atlantic
                        Treaty. He said that he was in favor of an alliance with the US, with Great
                        Britain and with Germany (he did not mention other NATO members), but
                        whether in the same form as the present treaty he could not be sure at this
                        time. He said for example he would have to “look at” the question of a
                        council as he was not quite sure what a council would do. He then stated
                        very clearly and definitely that any form of integration would have to go
                        when the time came to review the treaty. He said that in France there would
                        be no longer any troops or military installations not under French command,
                        but that of course if Germany wished to have American and British troops
                        this was their right. He mentioned that for other reasons France would
                        probably wish to maintain some forces in Germany. He emphasized however
                        again that all forces and installations on the territory of France would be
                        under French command and French command alone, with the clear implication
                        that there would no longer be any foreign troops on French soil. He said
                        these changes in the NATO structure would not certainly be made this year
                        and in any event, while not committing himself to any specific time except
                        before 1969, that other allies including the US would be given plenty of
                        warning and time to consider the French suggestions.</p>
                    <p>I asked the General, since he had fought in two world wars, if he did not
                        think that the allies, particularly in World War I, had not suffered a great
                        deal from the absence of unity of command. He said possibly, but pointed out
                        that in World War I the British and subsequently American troops had fought
                        in France but, as he put it, had been under French law, i.e., that France
                        had been in control of all actions on her soil. He said there would be no
                        objection to various plans drawn up by headquarters to be put into effect
                        when hostilities start, assigning one sector or another to different
                        commanders, but he said that integration would be finished.</p>

                    <p>I told him my impression of the NATO set up was that most staff planning was
                        for future contingencies, and he waved this aside and said no, and under US
                        control.</p>

                    <p>5415. For Secretary from Popper. Recognize that considerations of highest
                        importance must have led to your decision to postpone your departure for
                        NATO Ministerial.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">Because of the crisis in the

                            he would not be able to attend the session. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> flew to London when the crisis eased, arriving on

                        delegations with disappointment and by some, including Secretary-General,
                        with deep dismay.</p>
                    <p>We know of course that Under Secretary will present US case on matters we
                        wish to handle in NATO with fullest effectiveness. That is not the problem.
                        It is rather that this sharp break from precedent comes at a time when the
                        Alliance is under attack and when therefore Alliance morale is especially

                    <p>Our friends in NATO take comfort and gain conviction from your presence and
                        your presentation. Their private exchanges of views with you have a tonic
                        effect. Conversely, your absence will inevitably be used in some quarters to
                        support view that our interest in Alliance is diminishing. In future other
                        Ministers may be impelled without the same justification to absent
                        themselves from Ministerial meetings. Next year or two may be critical for
                        NATO; it would be most unfortunate time for such a trend to gain ground.</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic"> NATO Nuclear Committee</hi>. Secretary explained that
                        US slowed down activity <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working Group as
                        accommodation to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and not to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or Russians. Germans don't want
                        to push subject before September elections and all interested participants
                        want to keep discussions going in meantime. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he considering parallel activity, discussions of
                        nuclear policy in NATO Nuclear Committee in June. Some NATO countries desire
                        meeting and he thought France willing to participate. It would initially
                        examine information available since discussions of 1962. He hoped US could
                        contribute useful information.</p>
                    <p>Secretary cautioned Nuclear Committee meeting might raise serious problems
                        between Paris and Bonn and suggested most important that <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> be in full agreement before
                        initiation such sensitive meetings, especially in light of possible talks
                        between French and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on nuclear
                        matters about which we and Germans have not been filled in. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> admitted that at moment Germans less
                        keen than others, but had objected only on basis of possible conflict with
                            <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        Working Group. <persName corresp="#p_PDH1">Popper</persName> warned US has
                        no great new array information available for presentation at a June meeting.
                        Secretary referred to analysis of Peking possible second nuclear explosion,
                        which would be reported <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> in any case.
                        Secretary suggested that alleged differences on strategy between major NATO
                        countries is more matter of politics and budgets than true military
                        question. He did not despair that quietly over time <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0240"/>apparent differences might be resolved.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said it was for this reason
                        he would shortly see Messmer about forthcoming Defense Ministers' meeting.
                        He hoped in time common ground would evolve although not optimistic much
                        more would emerge from <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>'s meeting
                        than agreement for studies to continue.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">State of Alliance</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s suggestions for more intensive study of state of
                        Alliance and asked how urgently we viewed problem. Secretary explained that
                        last December <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had said
                        French would make proposals for Alliance reorganization, probably in 1967 in
                        anticipation of 1969 date. He now had impression French might be advancing
                        timetable. Question therefore is do we wait and see what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> suggests or do we try to see what
                        remaining members want. For example, do Europeans want to organize defense
                        together with US or separately. In spite of prosperity, Europeans show no
                        signs of being ready to pay for own separate defense. <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> cautioned that, although we must
                        prepare for serious French surprises, he doubted whether the Permanent
                        Council was at this stage right arena for raising substantive discussion of
                        state of Alliance. Secretary observed that when husband and wife talk of
                        divorce, it is already too late. US does not want to push far-reaching
                        over-hasty fundamental discussions but does wish to begin preparations where
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thought his and Secretary's
                        approach much the same. He agreed it was desirable to prepare the ground;
                        however, it was better not to pin ourselves down too firmly about time and
                        type of activity at this point.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>. Secretary said Greeks and Turks continuing
                        to meet bilaterally and working on location further talks with Greeks
                        preferring New York and Turks Paris. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said Costopoulos <note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Greek
                            Foreign Minister Stavros Costopoulos.</note> claimed Makarios had agreed
                        to accept whatever two sides agreed upon and Secretary cautioned against
                        over-optimism on Makarios.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_Noforn1">Noforn</gloss> and subject to review:</p>
                    <p>Calling at his request May 21, French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> and Secretary had tour d'horizon in which Santo
                        Domingo, Southeast Asia, <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear
                        weapons and NATO were discussed along familiar lines. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>'s remarks about French attitude
                        toward NATO and its European neighbors of particular interest. Replying to
                        Secretary's query re significance of Couve's remarks on NATO to Foreign
                        Affairs Commission of National Assembly May 20, <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had told him that time would be ripe “next year” for
                        discussion of revision of NATO. Secretary remarked that last December
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had mentioned 1967 as
                        time for such discussion, which perhaps indicates French are accelerating
                        time schedule. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> stated he hoped
                        consideration of NATO revision could be handled by “silent diplomacy” and
                        that agreement on changes could eventually be reached quietly and
                        undramatically.</p>
                    <p>Secretary pointed out <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> continues to stress
                        NATO no longer corresponds to existing needs and world situation but does
                        not state specifically how NATO should be revised to make it conform with
                        changed circumstances. Secretary said it would be most helpful if <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> could give us its more detailed thinking on
                        this subject.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> pointed out France in 1958 had
                        put forth proposals for reorganizing the Alliance but had been rebuffed.
                        Secretary smilingly commented that if France were able to obtain acceptance
                        of its neighbors for those proposals, US would have agreed. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> retorted France different from its
                        neighbors in two important respects: namely, it is a world power and has
                        nuclear weapons capability. Secretary said he hoped emphasis France places
                        on nuclear capability as status symbol would not encourage proliferation.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said France hoped its <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0242"/>neighbors would not achieve nuclear
                        weapon programs for long time to come but in long run, proliferation
                        probably inevitable.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">On June 3, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> transmitted a lengthy
                            telegram summarizing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            intentions toward NATO. He suggested that in response to statements
                            about France's unwillingness to propose specific revisions, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would demand early in 1966 a
                            firmer commitment by the United States under Article 5 and revision or
                            deletion of Article 9, which provided for the North Atlantic Council.
                            Since France expected these proposals would be unacceptable to the rest
                            of the Alliance, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would
                            be given an excuse to terminate the treaty. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> added that it was also clear France intended, by
                            1969 at the latest, to have no forces or installations on French soil
                            that were not under French command and subject to French law. (Telegram

                    </p>
                    <p>In concluding talk, Secretary said he wished to stress we are in no way
                        contemplating use of nuclear weapons in SEA; nevertheless we feel we cannot
                        make commitment never to be first country to resort to nuclear warfare. In
                        case US was faced with fighting 800 million people, use of nuclear weapons
                        could be necessary to avoid being bled to death. Secretary emphasized
                        however that we do not wish war with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s nor do we seek excuse destroy Chinese nuclear
                        capability.</p>

                        suggestion has been considered by others and U.S. has had opportunity to
                        study their comments and proposals. Committee would be ad hoc, not a
                        permanent body.</p>
                    <p>2. Group—as suggested by U.S.—would have two principal agenda items:</p>
                    <p>a) Examination of possible means of improving and extending Allied
                        participation in planning for use of nuclear forces, including strategic
                        nuclear forces. In course of its study, Committee would presumably examine
                        present procedures, established after Ottawa meeting in May 1963, whereby
                        non-U.S. officials participate in planning for use of nuclear forces
                        committed to Alliance and make recommendations as to how these procedures
                        could be improved;</p>
                    <p>b) To work out technical means for fast and secure communications among NATO
                        governments so that consultation is practical possibility in event of crisis
                        in which use of nuclear weapons may be contemplated. Agreement that such
                        consultations should take place is already established in Athens Guidelines
                        of 1962.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">For text of the communique issued at the
                            conclusion of the Athens North Atlantic Council session, May 6, 1962,
                            see ibid., 1962, pp. 541–543.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Purpose of new proposal is to study how to provide greater degree of
                        participation in nuclear planning for those desiring to participate, in line
                        with general tendency of Allied thinking since Athens Ministerial Meeting in
                        1962. As <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated, this is
                        additional to whatever action may be taken re <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> proposals, not in
                        substitution. Hence, Select Committee would not impinge on work of Paris
                            <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        Working Group.</p>
                    <p>4. Select Committee will examine problems and make recommendations; it will
                        not make “decisions” in its own right. Recommendations would presumably be
                        considered at government level by all NATO members and might be discussed at
                        future Ministerial Meeting of Alliance. U.S. recognizes that a committee
                        composed of less than total membership of NATO would not take action binding
                        on others not represented in it.</p>

                    <p>The President reaffirmed the determination of the US to keep the Alliance
                        intact. He asked the Chancellor if he was familiar with the statement he
                        made on May 7<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">See <ref target="#d82fn3">footnote
                                3, Document 82</ref>.</note> in which he had made clear the
                        determination of the US to support its Allies in Europe and had assured them
                        that they could depend on the US. The President stressed that the US will
                        stay in Germany and in Europe as long as it is needed.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor thanked the President for his May 5 and May 8 statements.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Neither of these statements has been further
                            identified.</note> He affirmed that he and the German people agreed
                        entirely with these views. The President said more in those two statements
                        than General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has said
                        altogether.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he would have to meet with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> next week. There were serious
                        differences between Germany and France on many issues, and, except for the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, they had virtually no common
                        positions at this time.</p>
                    <p>The President said he understood the problem and assured the Chancellor that
                        he understood his difficulties with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. He said that he thought both the US and Germany
                        should make their positions very clear to the General.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied he did not want a public quarrel or confrontation next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>The President affirmed that the US could rely on Germany more than any other
                        partner of the Alliance. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        must be asked exactly where he stood, but the President agreed that this
                        question might better <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0245"/>be asked
                        after the elections in September. This issue could not be postponed
                        indefinitely, however, and especially not until 1969. The US was determined
                        to preserve the Alliance, and, although it hoped that France would remain in
                        it, at worst the Alliance could continue without France.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was very
                        well aware of the Chancellor's position. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> did not really want a European Europe, but he knew
                        that the Chancellor would not agree to anything that would disrupt NATO.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor repeated his view that a confrontation should wait until after
                        the elections and assured the President that Germany would not be afraid to
                        use hard language with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. One
                        problem was that there were still groups in Germany sympathizing with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> because of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> friendship. In the past <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> could always be certain that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> would follow whatever he
                        suggested. The President could be assured—and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> also knew this very well—that the Chancellor's
                        attitude now was quite different and that this Chancellor would not just do
                        what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> desired. Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> also assured the President
                        that he was not at all worried or impressed by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s bluff of flirting with Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the Chancellor was enduring <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> just as reluctantly as he did,
                        but that it might be wise to be patient until after the elections. After the
                        elections it should be made clear to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> that NATO would continue with or without France.</p>
                    <p>The President told the Chancellor he should bring forward any ideas he might
                        have to further German reunification and any approaches that he might think
                        feasible. He could be assured such suggestions would be listened to
                        sympathetically.</p>

                    <p>2484. There have been repeated rumors that French may shortly ask US in
                        effect to vacate certain military facilities in France. While we now <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0246"/>suspect that such a request will be
                        postponed until after the French elections in December we cannot be sure of
                        this. The following guidance is therefore being sent against the contingency
                        that the request will be made within the next few weeks or months.</p>
                    <p>A French request of the US to vacate certain or all military facilities in
                        France or place them under French command would be consistent with emerging
                        policies of Elysee, and would probably be preliminary step to subsequent
                        French move, which likely take place after French elections, to disengage
                        France from NATO organization and specifically from integrated NATO military
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>Premature reaction (i.e. by pressing for immediate across-board confrontation
                        on French intentions re NATO) to early French request to withdraw from
                        certain military facilities could be harmful to our interests and to NATO.
                        It could permit French to argue it was we and not they who were taking
                        initiative to exclude France from NATO community, and thus to break up the
                        Alliance. A reaction of this kind would also prevent us from engaging in
                        essential systematic and intensive consultation with our allies to ensure
                        that Alliance responds effectively to any French political attack, and
                        emerges without unnecessary loss of strength. Moreover, while internal study
                        already underway, US Government will need some time to study effect and cost
                        of various ways in which we might act. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.
                        At later stage we may well wish use French request for removal facilities as
                        basis for general confrontation, depending on timing, tactics, public
                        presentation, etc. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, our present plan is to respond along following lines to any
                        early official inquiry about US reaction to French demand, if made, for
                        withdrawal of some or all American military presence from France:</p>
                    <p>1. Naturally we shall give careful consideration to any French request, with
                        specific reference to:</p>
                    <p>(a) the effect of withdrawal actions on the defensive capabilities of the
                        Alliance and on NATO itself;</p>
                    <p>(b) the relevant provisions of the legal arrangements under which the
                        facilities in question are established in France;</p>
                    <p>(c) the military effects and the cost of removing facilities from France and
                        making the necessary alternative arrangements;</p>
                    <p>(d) the consequences of any substantial change in the US military
                        establishment in France as regards NATO as a whole.</p>
                    <p>2. The US would respond to a French request only after a careful review of
                        these questions, and after such military and political consultation as might
                        be required particularly with allies dependent upon supplies and services
                        now furnished through France or allies whose territories might be affected
                        by alternative arrangements. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> study on <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> and other US facilities in France and their possible
                        relocation is now underway. Conclusions this study available in several
                        weeks. <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0247"/>Only then could consultation
                        with allies begin as a necessary precondition to relocation. Consequently,
                        immediate or hasty response to any French request for withdrawal infeasible
                        on practical as well as psychological grounds. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. Our allies should be left in no doubt that US commitment to NATO and
                        determination to provide full political and military support remains
                        unimpaired.</p>

                        <item>Lord Hood, Deputy Under Secretary</item>
                        <item>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick Dean</persName>,
                            Ambassador</item>
                    </list>
                    <p> Lord Hood stated that his previous conversations with the Under Secretary
                        and with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> had disclosed
                        broad agreement on our analysis of French intentions.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Memoranda of the conversations with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> on June 15 are ibid., POL US and DEF 4
                            NATO.</note> Both governments felt that we should use the rest of this
                        year to prepare for steps we might have to take if and when the French
                        acted, after the December Presidential election. We both considered that the
                        implications of the French position for NATO were serious but not fatal, and
                        that what the French might do with respect to NATO and U.S. facilities in
                        France was more serious than what they could do through withdrawal of their
                        forces from NATO commitment. We agreed that NATO could make alternative
                        arrangements if it must, but that these would be less satisfactory than
                        those we now had.</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0248"/>
                    <p>Accordingly, we must try to deter <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> from moving, if possible. Bribery and threats would be
                        counter-productive. The right approach was to: (1) continue acting on the
                        assumption that NATO would go on as an institution; (2) synchronize
                        statements by allied leaders supporting NATO principles; (3) let it be known
                        that we were taking the necessary precautions to meet possible French
                        actions; (4) continue the momentum on NATO programs such as stepping up
                        political consultation, the NATO Force Planning Exercise, and so forth,
                        while maintaining an open door for the French; and (5) consider carefully
                        any specific proposals made by the French. Generally, it was in our interest
                        to seek to gain time by this largely declaratory policy, and against our
                        interest to precipitate a crisis.</p>
                    <p> Lord Hood continued that if this approach were correct, the next step would
                        be to put the matter to certain of the allies. This could best be done when
                        the Under Secretary went to Paris early next month for the special <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting. The Germans, Dutch and Italians
                        were most important in this respect; Lord Hood asked whether the US and the
                        UK should not approach them jointly. The Secretary thought this would be
                        bound to lead to leaks and would heighten the impact of the conversations;
                        furthermore, it would provoke a reaction from those allies not jointly
                        approached. He did not think we should engage in joint US–UK talks with
                        others at this time.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the French attitude created insecurity and
                        nervousness, because of doubts regarding the status of the North Atlantic
                        Treaty after 1969. He wondered whether it would not be advantageous for a
                        number of us to state at the December Ministerial Meeting that we did not
                        intend to avail ourselves of the privilege of denouncing the treaty. He
                        asked whether such a step would provoke <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. Lord Hood thought not, depending on how it was done.
                        He recalled the 1954 Nine-Power declaration at London,<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">For text of the Final Act of the London Nine-Power
                            Conference, October 3, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations, 1952–1954, vol. V</hi>
                            </ref>, pp. 1345 ff. </note> in which the French participated, declaring
                        that they regarded the North Atlantic Treaty as being of indefinite
                        duration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked whether there should be any more precise or more
                        formal discussion with the French at this time. Lord Hood was inclined to
                        think not: the French would hear of the exercise on which we were embarking,
                        and we would stand ready to bring them into any discussions on NATO problems
                        if they desired—as was the case in connection with the Select Committee of
                        Defense Ministers. The Secretary agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> explained that we planned to
                        compare US and UK talking papers which could be used for exploratory
                        bilateral discussions <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0249"/>with other
                        allies. He did not expect that there would be any substantial difference
                        between the two papers, though difference of emphasis might later appear as
                        to the time and occasion for a confrontation with the French. This might be
                        particularly true after the German election, when we might desire to move
                        forward on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> negotiations even though that might produce a strong
                        reaction. The matter could be left open for the present, however.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Vice Chancellor Mende had expressed the
                        opinion to him that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might
                        be taking such a hard line on NATO in order to obtain a stronger French
                        position in the organization.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">A memorandum of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>'s conversation with
                            Vice Chancellor Erich Mende at 10:15 a.m. on June 16 is in Department of
                            State, Central Files, DEF 4 NATO.</note> It was agreed that there was no
                        real sign that giving the French more of the important jobs or more
                        authority would have any substantial result.</p>
                    <p> Lord Hood suggested, and it was agreed, that we would exchange lists of
                        actions we thought the French might take vis-a-vis NATO. It was also agreed
                        that when the Defense Department study of the possible relocation of U.S.
                        and NATO facilities in France had been completed, it should be discussed
                        with U.K. experts. A meeting of legal experts in Washington might consider
                        the legal problems which could be created by French action, and a regularly
                        scheduled public affairs experts meeting in London, now scheduled for the
                        second week in July, could look at the problem of public affairs policies on
                        the French and NATO.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what it would be wise to say if the press inquired about
                        rumors that contingency plans were being made for a French withdrawal from
                        NATO. The consensus was that one could take the line that “contingency
                        planning” was too dramatic a term, but that naturally statements made by the
                        French required us to give some thought to the problems which might
                        arise.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Secretary asked when and where the Winter Ministerial Meeting
                        should meet in view of the French election. Lord Hood thought that the
                        locale should remain Paris, but that the date might be changed. He suggested
                        that the Under Secretary might discuss the matter with Secretary General
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> in Paris next month, at the
                        same time explaining the purpose of our bilateral contacts on the French
                        problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> noted that we
                        were seeking advice from Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName>
                        on the subject.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the conversation the Secretary asked how we should handle
                        the problem of the new <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> Headquarters
                        building. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> explained
                        that our failure to send instructions to <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, stating that we were preparing to move ahead with it, was
                        holding up the development of a situation in which the French would be the
                        only opponents of constructing a new building. The Defense Department now
                        seemed to <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0250"/>be ready to agree. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> believed that it would be
                        useful for the situation to unfold in this way, so that we could make it
                        clear that we were continuing a business-as-usual policy in NATO. Lord Hood
                        agreed.</p>

                            The Ambassador also expressed his feeling that the United States might
                            not be far enough along in its own thinking to have profitable
                            discussions. (Ibid.)</note> I do not contemplate imprudence.</p>
                    <p>We had a useful first conversation with Lord Hood with regard to NATO
                        problems and he expressed a willingness to meet me in Paris for further
                        conversation. I hope to have exploratory and totally non-committal
                        conversations with other representatives who may come from other capitals
                        for the meeting of the NATO Council. I shall also tell Couve, if I see him,
                        that we are of course looking forward to any proposals the French Government
                        may put forward regarding the revision of NATO although I understand the
                        government is not expecting to make such moves until next year.</p>
                    <p>The position of the United States Government at the moment is that we do not
                        have definitively formulated views but are simply soliciting the suggestions
                        of other governments in a very preliminary manner.</p>
                    <p>I do not expect this matter to get into the public domain to any great
                        extent. In the NATO session we held last March we were successful in
                        maintaining a high degree of security.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">Documentation on <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s

                        morning of 14th. This might enable participation of Schroeder and Fanfani at
                        NATO discussions, which important in its own right. I have definite
                        impression that both Foreign Ministers wish handle bilaterals

                    <p>Polto 1875. Select Committee (<gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>) proposal.
                        Following highlights informal PermReps plus one meeting <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s office June 29 discuss creation
                            <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>. (<persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> felt it essential have such informal meeting smoke
                        out others, particularly French on <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> and
                        make available more detailed suggestions than made at <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meet.) For this purpose I prepared
                        statement (being forwarded by pouch) based on Dept Topol 1707 and Circs 2443
                        and 2412,<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">Circular telegram 2412 is <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>. Circular telegram 2443, June 7,
                            discussed the size and composition of the committee, France's
                            participation, its relationship to other NATO bodies, a timetable for
                            its organization, and its terms of reference, but added that the
                            Department of State and Defense were just beginning to discuss what
                            substantive questions the committee might want to address. (Department
                            of State, Central Files, DEF 4 NATO) Topol 1707, June 17, elaborated on
                            the problems that the committee might consider, but again stressed that
                            U.S. thinking was “preliminary and certainly not rigid.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        which was passed out at meeting.</p>
                    <p>Before reading paper I mentioned fact that many <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s had approached us to obtain more details <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> proposal and therefore at suggestion <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> I prepared informal statement in effort be
                        helpful, emphasizing meeting and paper both informal, that we did not wish
                        to establish <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> as new NATO institution but
                        was merely a mechanism see how could obtain suggestions for better nuclear
                        consultation. Also emphasized desire to [hear?] suggestions from others and
                        hope that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would continue follow through
                        in order expedite matter.</p>

                    <p>Following are informal comments after paper read:</p>
                    <p>Canada (Ignatieff) welcomed <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> suggestion
                        since Canada desired further discussion nuclear matters for long time and it
                        essential come to grips with implications of Athens and Ottawa decisions.
                        While all hope deterrent will work, must recognize this depends on the will
                        to employ which means must consult in detail ahead of time to avoid
                        misunderstanding and to know how and when weapons should be used if
                        necessary. While suggestion <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> will be
                        helpful, <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should continue nuclear
                        consultations and any suggestions by <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> must
                        be subject to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> approval. Ignatieff raised
                        following points:</p>
                    <p>1. Not sure why it implied <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> should only
                        report to Ministerial meetings rather than regular <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> should probably be composed three
                        nuclear and three non-nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> should not be institutionalized.</p>
                    <p>4. What would be frequency of <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> meetings and
                        locale and the role of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>5. Nuclear consultations should build on Athens and Ottawa agreements.</p>
                    <p>Ignatieff then suggested following topics for <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> discussion:</p>
                    <p>1. Coordination of tactical weapons assigned NATO commanders.</p>
                    <p>2. Coordination use <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> weapons.</p>
                    <p>3. Coordination use future nuclear weapons systems, tactical or external.</p>
                    <p>4. Role of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> in emergency situation in
                        relation to above nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>5. Elaborate on Athens guidelines.</p>
                    <p>6. Improved communications.</p>
                    <p>7. Increase Allied roles in strategic planning (e.g. greater NATO role <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, wider role <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> nuclear deputy, permanent consultative role Nuclear
                        Committee).</p>
                    <p>8. How provide for greater role NATO governments in nuclear matters.</p>
                    <p>(Ignatieff later circulated paper covering points—being pouched.)</p>
                    <p>Belgium (<persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName>) agreed
                        generally with Canadian points and welcomed <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> suggestion. Endorsed idea meetings should be informal since
                        wished make sure not reduce role of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        which must make final decisions. He thought suggestion <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s or regular Ministerial meetings
                        would be only ones to discuss <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>'s
                        suggestions incorrect, since this gave impressions <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> being denigrated—“There are not two councils, only one, and
                        at some of its meetings FonMins present.” He asked for clarification what we
                        had in mind in setting up working group and/or panels since it obvious
                            <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s will not be able to do
                        detailed work. Expressed hope <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would keep
                        countries not on <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> informed of developments
                        and questioned suggestion US paper that <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>
                        have <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> consult regarding purely military
                        matters. <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> felt entire
                        question <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0253"/>although military was
                        definitely more political than military and did not like give impression
                            <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> and military would make suggestions
                        without full consideration by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as
                        political body. He also asked how <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> hoped
                        handle question.</p>
                    <p> UK (<persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>) welcomed <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> and supported US statement which refined and
                        defined <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s suggestion but
                        made it clear that proposals were basically limited. Therefore he not sure
                        whether Canadians' and Belgians' suggestions regarding broad questions to be
                        discussed by <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> were its role. He envisaged
                            <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> making procedural suggestions and not
                        being a permanent body. Adding if <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> only
                        made basic procedural recommendations would not be difficult agree on
                        limited membership, otherwise problem most difficult. <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> would only make recommendations while <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> in permanent or Ministerial session would
                        make decisions.</p>
                    <p>Italy (Alessandrini) agreed with colleagues but felt his government would
                        insist upon <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as ultimate decision body
                        and he wished to know what role <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would be
                        re <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Germany (<persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>) welcomed <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> proposals and remarked pleased hear US paper
                        suggested working group or panels since obviously <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s would not have time work out detailed suggestions.
                        Recalled both Athens and Ottawa meetings were combined FonMin and <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meetings and underlined any
                        consideration <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> suggestions should be by
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> or combined Ministerial meetings. He
                        wondered how limited suggestions of US paper could be reconciled with wider
                        suggestions on <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> made by Canada and Belgium
                        but in any event he certain <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would want
                        to be sure <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> involved in any decisions and
                        thought that before final <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss> suggestions
                        submitted December Ministerial meeting draft they should be considered by
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as political body.</p>
                    <p>Netherlands (Boon) welcomed <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s initiative since discussion nuclear matters can come
                        only if nuclear powers so desire. Thought it important first to draw up
                        mandate <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>. Said it essential make sure
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> has final decision and pointed out
                        Alliance had never before used special category of Ministers other than
                        FonMins to make decisions for it and therefore any final suggestions should
                        be presented to Council meeting rather than <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meeting. He glad committee open-ended and his government
                        will decide whether they would like to be on committee after mandate
                        established since Dutch not convinced such important matter should be
                        studied just by few. He too wished to know position <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and hoped there would be no changes in usual <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> operations in connection with establishing
                            <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>. He closed with statement saying he
                        welcomed these discussions and Dutch would decide later what final position
                        would be.</p>
                    <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>
                    <p>Greece (Palamas) welcomed suggestions, reiterated decisions must be by
                        Council but gave green light to any agreed arrangements to work out
                        procedural suggestions of <gloss target="#t_SC2">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p> US (<persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName>) expressed gratitude
                        for responses and stated he agreed with most suggestions but felt personally
                        that narrow interpretation given by UK was more in keeping with our
                        suggestions than those raised by Canada and Belgium.</p>
                    <p>He too impressed with the apparent unanimity expressed by others that
                        paramount role of Permanent Council should be protected since it was a
                        unique organization and should not be deprived in any way of its
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>France (Schricke) merely thanked us for further details but stated had no
                        instructions. He added odd statement that Athens and Ottawa meetings were
                        meetings of FonMins and not combined FonMin-<gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> meetings. No one commented.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">On June 10, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> reported
                            that the French seemed “generally favorable” toward going ahead with the
                            committee, but subsequent conversations indicated their position would
                            be determined on the specifics of the proposal. (Polto 1790 from Paris;
                            ibid.) On June 30, at a lunch given by <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, the French Permanent Representative attacked the
                            idea of the committee discussing the improvement of communications
                            (beyond the competence of the Defense Ministers) and the use of nuclear
                            weapons (a political question also beyond their competence). While
                                <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> argued that both
                            questions should be studied by the Defense Ministers, he concluded that
                            the final French position was still unclear, but the rest of the
                            Alliance should be prepared to prevent the French from blocking the work
                            of the committee. (Polto 1883 from Paris; ibid.)</note>

                    <p>The Ambassador thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> might
                        be interested in a telegram he had received from Rome giving an “objective
                        evaluation” of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis. According to
                        the message as read by the Ambassador, all institutions of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, and all member governments except the
                        French, had agreed on the package proposal of the Commission re: <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>, financing through a common external tariff
                        and increased powers for the European Parliament. All had held fast to that
                        position except Spaak who said Belgium could not accept new commitments as
                        long as they had a caretaker government. A revised transitional arrangement
                        proposed by Italy was supported by the Germans and Dutch but rejected by the
                        French. It was true that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council had
                        failed to meet the June 30 deadline as the French had wished, but this date
                        had no “final value.”</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, according to the Foreign Office telegram, despite the
                        pessimistic atmosphere created by the French, the Brussels discussions had
                        been useful and had provided a basis for continuing activities in the
                        Commission and the Council. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wishes
                        to continue these activities and all the more so since Italy has succeeded
                        to the chairmanship of the Council. The GOI therefore hopes the other
                        members will act according to a European line of conduct.</p>
                    <p>Commenting that the telegram provided a “less dramatic” interpretation than
                        did the press of events in Brussels, the Ambassador asked what the Under
                        Secretary thought of French intentions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he assumed the French intended to
                        forestall any supra-national elements <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0256"/>from developing in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">In a memorandum for the

                        deadline for a weighted-majority voting system, the French wanted leverage
                        and calculated that this was as good a way as any to get it. In response to
                        the question whether he thought the French were prepared to destroy the
                        Common Market, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the
                        matter had now reached the poker game stage. It would seem that the French
                        are counting on the other five to draw back. The Ambassador said he agreed
                        and, speaking personally, he thought the French had the easier position.
                        They can threaten to destroy the Common Market, which Italy and Germany are
                        not free to do.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">On July 8, French Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> informed Secretary

                            France had made concessions in the agricultural and industrial policy
                            areas, it could not accept new and unanticipated conditions giving
                            control of funds to the commission and supervisory authority to a
                            parliament that represented no government. France would not seek to undo
                            the progress that had been achieved up to June 30, but would freeze
                            everything as it was, and <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                            offered no timetable on how long it might take to resolve the crisis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> did not comment on the
                            crisis except to say that press reports that it had been manufactured by
                            the United States and the United Kingdom were “absolute nonsense.”

                    <p>“The current crisis in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> relations came to
                        a head over a technical agriculture question but the real issue is
                        supranationalism. When the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission
                        interjected the latter issue into the forum, the French seized it for their
                        own purposes.</p>
                    <p>“The current internal <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> struggle is likely

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> said that he had
                        a series of questions to ask about the Select Committee proposal which
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had put to NATO
                        May 31. First, what exactly did he see as the task of this committee?
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> recalled that
                        initially the U.S. had emphasized the technical aspects of communications,
                        but this emphasis may now have changed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the objective was to
                        determine how the desire for greater participation in nuclear affairs by
                        other members of the Alliance might be met. In spite of all the discussion
                        of this problem, none of the other members of NATO have come up with
                        specific proposals, and all initiatives—he cited the Omaha liaison
                        arrangements, the Athens Guidelines, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        and various papers analyzing strategic and military problems—have come from
                        the United States. Apart from the French, who desire to see no changes made,
                        no concrete suggestions have come forth. He accepted the desire for a
                        greater degree of participation as bona fide. Unfortunately, however, there
                        had been no effective forum for discussion of these problems. Every time
                        these issues came up, there were fifty or sixty people around. Out of a
                        discussion among a limited number in the Select Committee, plans for
                        achieving a greater degree of participation may evolve. This was the primary
                        objective of the Select Committee suggestion. The Committee would make
                        recommendations to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and would not take
                        decisions on its own. He did not want the discussion limited to technical
                        aspects, but these aspects were important to begin with: unless the
                        technical problems could be resolved, there was little point in further
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if the
                        Select Committee would not infringe on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working Group. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied in the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"/>negative. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working
                        Group was only concerned with this one narrow subject. There is no
                        discussion in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Working Group of the
                        basic issue of how greater Alliance participation in nuclear affairs is to
                        be achieved. This group is simply concerned with one facet of the approach
                        to the problem. Even if the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> comes into existence, it will not fulfill
                        all of the needs in this area. The Select Committee and the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were
                        complementary, not conflicting or mutually exclusive.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked about the
                        French attitude on the Select Committee. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was “positive, so far.”
                        He had been pleased and surprised at the French reaction. Some people
                        welcomed it whenever the French took a negative position, but he was not
                        among these. We gain by unity, not division, in the Alliance, and he very
                        much hoped the French would accept the proposal, which does not run counter
                        to any of France's objectives.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s hopes were not
                            realized. At a North Atlantic Council meeting on July 7, the French
                            Permanent Representative stated that France saw no useful purpose in the
                            Select Committee. However, at that time France did not indicate whether
                            that meant it would not participate in the committee or would attempt to
                            block its establishment. (Polto 29 from Paris, July 7; ibid.) On July
                            12, <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> reported that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> had
                            elaborated on this position, saying France would not object to the
                            committee proceeding, but would object to Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> having any part in it. (Polto 47

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked what we
                        would do if the French refused to participate. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said in this event he would wish
                        to go ahead with the Committee anyway. We should not dissolve the Alliance
                        because France refuses to cooperate, nor deny ourselves the gains which can
                        accrue to the rest of us from cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if we had
                        heard that the French will approve the Select Committee if the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> is abandoned. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we would not accept such an
                        exchange. These are unrelated questions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if the
                        Committee would be ad hoc or permanent. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it would be purely ad
                        hoc.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked whether it
                        would meet in July. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that there had been some talk of a meeting
                        July 27–28, but it was premature to make final decisions, since preliminary
                        questions had not been settled.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked about US
                        views on composition. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said membership was a matter for <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to decide. We assume that the US and the UK
                        will have to be members, since we are the ones that have the basic nuclear
                        information. We hope France will join. There is a case to be made for German
                        membership because of their majority military role in the Alliance. Our main
                        hope was that the Committee will be kept small. So far we have been trying
                        to work in far too large a group. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> noted that Italy and Canada had <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>been mentioned as possible members.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that no
                        Canadian authority had said anything to him about such an interest. He noted
                        we were not in favor of an “open-ended” Committee.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he thought
                        the Select Committee was the best way to determine just what the interests
                        of the other countries were as regards participation in nuclear affairs and
                        how to go about meeting these interests. He alluded to the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> problem and the problem of nuclear
                        decision-making as representative questions. The <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> problem has remained unsettled for three years, and he
                        thought this was “disgraceful.” We have got to find a forum and a method to
                        deal with problems such as these. We must get down to informed discussion.
                        He emphasized again that it would not be the Select Committee's business to
                        settle these questions but only to make recommendations to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if we
                        would be willing to discuss nuclear assistance to such countries as France.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he would be
                        happy to see this placed on the agenda of the Select Committee. This was a
                        perfectly legitimate subject to discuss. The basic point was that the US
                        should not have to assume responsibility for all tough decisions, such as
                        whether there should be <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s in Europe.
                        “It's not my soil and not my money.” He felt the Europeans had a perfect
                        right to ask the US for more information as a basis for more intelligent
                        discussion. The Select Committee could serve this purpose. After that, the
                        next step would be discussions and decisions at a higher level, perhaps in
                        the Nuclear Committee. NATO, he felt, had so far been too heavy on
                        procedure, and too light on substance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there is a host of important
                        questions that NATO is not acting on, partly because it is not organized to
                        do so. The Select Committee can help.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked whether we
                        would object to having a rotating member. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said this could be useful if the
                        Committee's life were extended. Some countries—the Scandinavians and
                        Portugal—do not appear to want to be on the Committee; others may wish to
                        participate, and rotation may be a way of meeting this desire without too
                        much enlargement of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked how we
                        felt about <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s chairing the
                        Select Committee. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        said he would be delighted and saw considerable merit in this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> raised the
                        question of the Defense Common Market. He asked whether we had “practical
                        means” in mind to give effect to this idea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we did not, that initially
                        it would have to be worked out on a bilateral basis. He felt that if each
                        NATO member could accept the principle of buying arms from the source of
                        highest quality and lowest cost, “we would shortly develop” a common market.
                        Another aspect would be to work out joint financing of major development
                        programs, such as the US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> main battle
                        tank program, <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0260"/>which is a step
                        forward and in which others may ultimately wish to join in. These programs
                        can lead to standardization of major weapons systems within the Alliance. A
                        common market would also involve freedom from duties and avoidance of
                        artificial restrictions on development and production. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if this concept would
                        imply a larger share of the market for Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that Europe is not now
                        competitive, and it will have to reorganize itself. There is no inherent
                        reason why European countries cannot meet the “highest quality, lowest
                        price” principle with proper organization and salesmanship. The problem now
                        is that individual countries are attempting too broad a spectrum of
                        production. This increases costs beyond competitive levels. European
                        countries will have to specialize. We do not intend either to exert pressure
                        or to subsidize on our own behalf, but we will compete. He felt European
                        countries can become more competitive if they act correctly and that they
                        will then naturally get a larger share of the market. We offer the
                        advantages of the US mass market. However, painful economic and politically
                        costly adjustments will be required, as was the case in the UK in canceling
                        the TSR–2.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> asked if this
                        will be worked out multilaterally. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he had given up on effectively approaching
                        these problems through multilateral action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> noted that after these questions had been worked out
                        bilaterally, they can be taken to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and
                        formalized. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        agreed.</p>

                    <head>95. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On March 25, 1965, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> sent a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stating that he had for some time
                        felt the need for a fresh look at U.S. policy toward Western Europe. To this
                        end he asked Ambassador John H. Ferguson to organize a study of the problem.
                        On July 9, Ferguson, who had been assisted by officials from the Departments
                        of State and Defense and the White House, transmitted his 87-page report,
                        “Europe and United States Policy,” to Bundy, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.
                        (Department of State, Central Files, POL <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                        W–US)</p>
                    <p>The report recommended the following courses of action with respect to
                        collective defense:</p>
                    <p>“A. Since France was likely to require that all integrated commands and
                        combat forces not under French command be removed from France, <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0261"/>the United States should consult at once
                        with its other allies to make the necessary transfers in an orderly
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>“B. The United States should proceed without delay in changes in NATO's
                        structure beginning with military planning beginning with steps that were
                        not subject to French veto.</p>
                    <p>“C. Discussions of NATO strategy had taken up an inordinate amount of time at
                        all levels of the alliance without narrowing the difference between Europe
                        and the United States. Because of this the United States should inform the
                        rest of the alliance that it would be prepared to use tactical nuclear
                        weapons to prevent the loss of NATO territory beyond a limited area along
                        its borders.</p>
                    <p>“D. The problem of an alliance nuclear force was up in the air until the
                        German elections had been held, but even following the elections neither the
                        Federal Republic nor the United Kingdom was likely to take the initiative on
                        this question. Therefore, in the fall the United States should hold private
                        conversations with London and Bonn to reach agreement on the terms of some
                        arrangement based on the principle of giving Germany an equal place to that
                        of other European nations in whatever arrangement was decided.”</p>
                    <p>On the matter of an integrated Europe, the United States should support steps
                        that led to further coordination in political and defense fields, as well as
                        those in monetary and production fields that would further integration.
                        Finally Ferguson addressed the problem of Germany. In this part of the
                        report the Ambassador stressed that finding an equal and adequate place for
                        Germany in the Western structure was crucial. This included support for West
                        German proposals for reunification.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I paid a farewell call on Couve this morning and it lasted much longer than I
                        had anticipated. I have already reported by telegram on Couve's views about
                        the Select Committee.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">See <ref target="#d94fn2">footnote 2, Document 94</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Couve roamed over a great many subjects.</p>
                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"/>
                    <p>He asked what I thought was the basic difficulty between France and the
                        United States. I said it was lack of communication. I said that the reserved
                        and austere attitude of the General made it extremely difficult if not
                        impossible to have full and frank interchanges of views. We then agreed that
                        there were certain basic differences between France and the United States
                        despite the overall, and we both hoped overriding, considerations of respect
                        of the two countries for each other and the real liking between them. Couve
                        acknowledged that it was extremely difficult to have the kind of full and
                        free interchange with the General which was necessary. In this connection,
                        however, Couve was distinctly negative on the idea of a meeting between the
                        President and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, implying his
                        doubt that there could be any useful communication between the two men.</p>
                    <p>Then coming down to the immediate issues, he said that the basic one was the
                        nuclear issue. He said that the General had chosen the nuclear issue as the
                        point on which to differ basically with NATO and that there was no
                        possibility of a solution to this difference in points of view.</p>
                    <p>He said that the problem centered on Germany. He said the United States
                        believed that by the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> device or something
                        like it Germany's ambitions for nuclear arms would be controlled. He said
                        France did not agree with that. France was more on the side of the Russians
                        in that argument. France believed that once the Germans got an undivided
                        joint interest in nuclear weapons, that would be only the first step toward
                        the building of a German force de frappe. I replied that the most likely way
                        of getting a German force de frappe was to deny her any joint and
                        indivisible interest in nuclear arms, in which event as a matter of national
                        pride she would be compelled to go out and get them on her own somehow.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on this question, Couve volunteered that France did not intend to
                        agree to any European nuclear force, jointly and severally owned, with
                        Germany in it. France was logical, and if she did not think it would work in
                        the Atlantic she did not think it would work in Europe.</p>
                    <p>I then said what are you going to do about the German ambitions for nuclear
                        weapons? Do you really think that Germany will continue to be the only
                        country in the world which has relinquished its right to have such weapons?
                        He said he thought that they would have to be obliged to accept this.</p>
                    <p>He then continued that he felt the future lay in an arrangement between
                        France and the UK which would set up a joint nuclear force. I asked him what
                        he meant by that and he said he meant joint arrangements to consider
                        strategy and possibly some joint institutions of two national forces de
                        frappe: one British and one French.</p>
                    <p>He said that he did recognize that there was the danger of a Rapallo deal by
                        the Germans with the Russians. On the other hand, he was not <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0263"/>badly worried about it because he felt that
                        the Russians were never going to let any Germany, unified or not, have
                        atomic weapons and that therefore we need not worry at all about a true
                        Rapallo which would put an atomic Germany on the side of the Russians.</p>
                    <p>I said wouldn't this leave things in a rather unsolved state? And wasn't it
                        possible that a Germany denied by its Atlantic Allies and denied by its
                        European Allies the right to have atomic weapons might become a very
                        difficult customer to deal with? He said that he recognized this but there
                        were certain questions which were insoluble.</p>
                    <p>With best regards.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        in view inability <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Martin to come
                        to Paris. Questions raised during bilaterals on subjects other than
                        NATO-French issue are being reported by separate telegrams. Participants
                        listed at end of cable.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary outlined preliminary US thinking, emphasizing that USG has
                        not arrived at definite conclusions and before doing so wishes have views of
                        other allies. Accumulating evidence available to us through various sources,
                        including direct statement to us by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and Couve de Murville, indicate that it virtually
                        certain France will at some stage make proposals or take further specific
                        steps designed to weaken or destroy NATO, especially its integrated military
                        arrangements and political machinery. This French attitude toward NATO must
                        be taken seriously, even though it is difficult to understand. Two world <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0264"/>wars have demonstrated conclusively
                        importance of creating an integrated military structure and forces in being
                        in time of peace as means of preventing war. France of all countries should
                        understand this. Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> seems to want to replace NATO with series of
                        old-fashioned bilateral military alliances. US of course has no interest in
                        purely bilateral military commitments with France. An integrated NATO is
                        important to the security of the US, but a bilateral commitment from the
                        French outside of such an integrated Atlantic military structure would be of
                        no value to us.</p>
                    <p>In our judgment it is probable that the French will not make any serious move
                        before the end of the year. It is uncertain when or how they will move, but
                        given <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s broad objectives it
                        is most important that the other allies engage in timely preparations for
                        whatever may come. It is probable that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s timetable for moving against NATO has been stepped
                        up and that he may begin to take specific actions in 1966 rather than
                        waiting until 1968 or 1969. He may put forward formal proposals for a
                        drastic revision of NATO or he may take a series of steps designed to
                        accomplish the same result piecemeal. The French have already blocked a NATO
                        decision for a new <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> building in
                        France. Other steps might be a request of the US and NATO to move NATO and
                        US facilities out of France, including some or all of the US air base
                        complex and some of communications. These actions could be taken
                        simultaneously with other piecemeal policies such as using the French veto
                        to prevent constructive developments in NATO, or increasing pursuit of the
                        empty-chair policy.</p>
                    <p>The French have tried to make it appear that 1969 calls for a basic review
                        and reform of NATO. However, this is not the case. NATO continues
                        indefinitely. The only significance of 1969 is that it is a date after which
                        a member may withdraw. In short, it is not a NATO problem, but a problem of
                        French policy toward NATO.</p>
                    <p>The US is now engaged in thorough technical studies of what would have to be
                        done if US and NATO facilities were to be removed from France. It is our
                        best military judgment that NATO could continue as an effective and credible
                        military deterrent even if the French should withdraw. Existing facilities
                        in France would in this event, of course, have to be moved elsewhere, which
                        would require specific agreements on physical arrangements with other NATO
                        countries, including probably at least the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
                        Belgium and Germany.</p>
                    <p>The US has no wish to provoke a confrontation with France on NATO. The best
                        possible solution would be for France to decide to continue in NATO and to
                        participate fully once more in carrying forward NATO objectives. If France
                        weakens its ties with NATO, or withdraws from it, that will be the result of
                        a unilateral French policy to isolate itself.</p>
                    <p>Question of timing and tactics to be followed by the other allies in response
                        to possible French moves is of great importance. If the French <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0265"/>present to NATO specific and definite
                        proposals for changing the structure, they should be considered carefully
                        and on their merits. If, on the other hand, the French should make certain
                        limited proposals, such as the removal of specific facilities from France, a
                        decision would have to be made on whether this should be an occasion for
                        requesting the French to explain their over-all objectives.</p>
                    <p>The US is carrying forward the present bilateral discussions on an entirely
                        private and informal basis. No doubt the French would learn of these talks.
                        If they inquire, they should be candidly informed that the other allies are
                        necessarily studying what they should do against the day when France might
                        act to carry out objectives which it has made known publicly and privately
                        in many ways.</p>
                    <p>The US hopes that the other allies would study these questions and that in
                        the fall, after the German elections, it would be possible to resume
                        bilateral discussions. By that time the US would have completed its own
                        studies on the military aspects.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing presentation was used in each of our bilateral talks. Following
                        are the observations on major points of the other countries concerned:</p>
                    <p>[Here follow a summary of the British view, described as in substantial
                        agreement with the U.S. assessment, the German position, described as in
                        complete agreement with the U.S. presentation, and the Dutch ideas about
                        four possibilities that France might choose; a report that the Italians and
                        Secretary General were extremely concerned not to provoke the French, while
                        the Belgians were generally in accord with the U.S. position; and a list of
                        the foreign participants in the bilateral conversations.]</p>

                    <p>The U.S. position is that NATO membership for Malta is not practicable
                        because of the deep-seated objection of several of the Allies<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> wrote in the margin at this
                            point: “Why do they object?”</note> and associated membership is
                        undesirable because it would introduce a <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0267"/>second-class status for which there is no provision in the
                        treaty. Therefore our objective has been to persuade NATO to work out
                        arrangements which would involve Malta in continuing close relationships
                        with NATO and NATO countries. This is desirable because of the existence of
                        the NATO base there and also, from a long-range point of view, to inhibit
                        the development of an irresponsible non-aligned posture in Malta which could
                        facilitate Communist designs.</p>
                    <p>From August 1964 until this spring we pushed our NATO Allies towards this end
                        without success, primarily because of the objections of France and the
                        Scandinavians. After Prime Minister Borg-Olivier intimated to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that he might be content with
                        something along the following line, we took the lead, acting through
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, to persuade <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to agree to a draft resolution which: (a)
                        affirms the deep interest of the members of NATO in the security of Malta,
                        (b) expresses the willingness of its members to consult with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> whenever the territorial integrity,
                        political independence, or security of Malta is threatened, and (c) confirms
                        the readiness of NATO members to examine at the request of <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> the possibility of establishing future
                        arrangements with Malta. The Maltese now seem to want to haggle. Regardless
                        of their attitude, it is most unlikely that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will agree to anything much more substantial than this
                        particular resolution for the indefinite future.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Following is a summary of the discussion at the luncheon of particular
                        relevance to <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's inquiry, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said that a major problem facing us in our European
                        relations was how to deal with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0268"/>attacks on
                        NATO. It was almost certain that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> would move on this reasonably soon. The Department is
                        preparing a position on how to deal with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, which we would be presenting to the President very
                        shortly. Once a position was established we would need to talk it over with
                        our major European allies, other than France, after the German elections
                        September 19. Our other allies will stand with us on NATO but it is
                        important to have full consultations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> also suggested that it might be useful to convey a
                        kind of warning message to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        fairly soon. He noted that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> planned to accompany Secretary Fowler on a trip to
                        Europe early in September and suggested that perhaps the Under Secretary
                        could call on the General and deliver a message from the President which
                        would be “a shot across the bow.” This would come just prior to the
                        General's press conference. The President said he would look at these
                        matters when they came to his attention.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said that our
                        position with respect to collective nuclear arrangements in Europe is
                        unsatisfactory. US policy has gone up and down on this, and it was essential
                        that a solid position be established in order to move it forward, which
                        would take somewhat more time.</p>
                    <p>The President made a general observation applicable to the nuclear as well as
                        to other problems discussed at the luncheon dealing with the fact it was
                        very important to assure Congressional support for important US policies
                        before they were crystallized and carried forward. He felt that much more
                        work needed to be done on this by the Department on the Hill and that
                        otherwise we would find that we do not get our policies through.</p>
                    <p>The President underlined the importance of effective public presentation of
                        US policies and US successes. He felt the State Department was not doing a
                        good enough job in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed diversity of opinion and viewpoint both within the
                        Department and among the Agencies in arriving at a policy. Once the policy
                        had been established, however, everyone should carry it out loyally and not
                        seek to undermine it.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> I told General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that I would like to review
                        certain problems that we foresaw in connection with the Western
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>The American people had made a very serious commitment with regard to NATO.
                        This was a commitment both to the treaty and the organization. The United
                        States had become an active participant in NATO because of our reading of
                        the lessons of two world wars.</p>
                    <p>The first lesson related to the Alliance. Many Europeans—including members of
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s government—had
                        remarked that the United States had come too late into both world wars. We
                        agreed with this statement. Had the United States been clearly committed to
                        the defense of Europe in advance both of the First and Second World Wars,
                        neither conflict might have occurred, and the world would have been saved
                        two major catastrophes. But our commitment had not been clearly defined and
                        the aggressor had, therefore, not been forced to take United States power
                        into account.</p>
                    <p>As a result of this experience the American people had made a great national
                        decision. They had thrown aside the isolation that had marked a hundred
                        years of our national history. They had made a commitment in peacetime to
                        defend Europe from aggression.</p>
                    <p>The second lesson from the two world wars was, in our view, that an alliance
                        could not be effective unless it was reenforced by a combined or integrated
                        command, by common planning, and by forces in being. After all, in the First
                        World War it had taken four years to achieve the appointment of Marshal Foch
                        as combined commander. In the Second World War the allies had suffered
                        greatly from the lack of effective collective preparation.</p>
                    <p>The American people would not, therefore, be able to understand a solemn
                        commitment such as their commitment to NATO if that commitment <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>were not reenforced by arrangements that
                        gave reality to common defense. For that reason the NATO Treaty and the NATO
                        organization were, in our view, inextricably linked, and it was very
                        important that this point be clearly understood.</p>
                    <p>This did not mean, of course, that all the arrangements were perfect or
                        immutable. We were prepared at any time to consider any changes that might
                        be proposed by any member of the Alliance. We recognized that conditions
                        changed, and that it might be necessary from time to time to revise
                        arrangements in order to accommodate to evolving conditions.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> replied that we did
                        not have time today to go into all the details of NATO. Anyway, the matter
                        was not urgent. The treaty ran until 1969 and there was no reason to move
                        quickly to change the organization. France and the United States were allied
                        and it was natural that they should remain allied so long as the Soviet
                        menace persisted. In his view, this menace would last for a considerable
                        time to come.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union attacked France—or conceivably attacked even the United
                        States—France and America would be in the war together. The French
                        Government certainly did not intend to break up the Alliance. There would be
                        a de facto understanding for common defense between the United States and
                        France even if no signed treaty existed.</p>
                    <p>The organization—as distinguished from the Alliance—was a different question.
                        The organization had not existed at the time the treaty was signed. And
                        since it was established, two major changes had taken place.</p>
                    <p>The first change was the advent of atomic weapons. In 1949 there were no
                        Soviet atomic weapons. But with the development of such weapons the United
                        States could not be sure—nor could its allies—as to what the United States
                        would do in the atomic field in the event of attack.</p>
                    <p>The second change had been the vast transformation of the nations of Western
                        Europe. They had moved from positions of weakness and dependency and were
                        now reasserting their national personalities.</p>
                    <p>France, for example, was no longer prepared to accept the principle of
                        subordination—which was what was meant by integration—or the control of
                        “foreign authority”, however amicable or friendly.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that, so far as
                        he was concerned, the Alliance would remain, but the organization was no
                        longer suitable. It must be reexamined. He hoped this could be done in
                        concert, but the United States should understand that France was not alone
                        in this field. Other countries were beginning to feel the same way. The
                        Germans, for example, were beginning to see, in the future, the need for an
                        alliance without subordination.</p>
                    <p>So far as France was concerned, he wanted to make it clear that there could
                        be no foreign forces on her soil except those under French command. The
                        French Government was making no proposals now. Later on <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>it would not make proposals but it would
                        lay down conditions. Those conditions would be made by discussions between
                        the two governments—the United States and France. Such discussions would not
                        involve Germany or the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The conversation had been running for a long time and I did not wish to
                        protract it unduly. I stated, however, that I must make clear the position
                        of the United States. We were not interested in domination. We were
                        interested in efficiency. We wanted to make certain that the West would be
                        defended effectively. The problem that preoccupied us was how we and our
                        allies could organize our common defense in the most efficient manner.</p>
                    <p>We felt that history had made it crystal clear that, to have an effective
                        common defense, a consolidated or integrated command was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the atom had brought about significant changes and we were deeply
                        concerned about the unfinished business of how to prevent the proliferation
                        of atomic power. We would be as disturbed as France by the development of a
                        German national nuclear capability. But this did not mean that the problem
                        of atomic management could be disregarded. In our view, nations that had
                        historically played a great role in world affairs could not be expected to
                        accept forever a situation in which they had no part in their own atomic
                        defense. Yet the option was clear enough—either we permitted such nations to
                        develop national nuclear systems of their own or we provided some kind of
                        collective approach which would permit them nuclear participation without
                        the need to develop their own national systems.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, we had proposed a collective arrangement in which the
                        non-nuclear powers of Europe could participate, in the form of a
                        multilateral force. Within the next few months it was going to be necessary
                        for us to resume consideration of this matter. We were not wedded to any
                        particular collective formula, but it seemed to us that some collective
                        solution was necessary. </p>
                    <p>All of this, I felt, had an obvious relevance to the NATO organization. I
                        made it clear that we were prepared to discuss with France and our other
                        allies any proposed changes that might make that organization more
                        effective. If there were to be such a discussion we saw efficacy in not
                        postponing it too long, since the operation of the present organization
                        could be seriously impaired if too many unresolved questions were left
                        pending.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> replied that he felt
                        the efficiency of an alliance would be seriously impaired if some members
                        felt subordinated to others, which was the present situation of the NATO
                        Alliance. So far as Germany was concerned, he must express a note of
                        caution. We all knew that the Germans were a great people. Because they were
                        a great people it was not possible to tell exactly what they would do.
                        France had been prepared <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0272"/>to sign a
                        treaty of friendship with the Germans and to join with the Germans in the
                        organization of Europe. But this did not mean that Germany could be accepted
                        on the same basis as other nations with reference to nuclear matters.</p>
                    <p>France had suffered from German invasions. Germany had been vanquished in the
                        last war. German participation—whether partial or indirect—in the control of
                        atomic weapons would certainly ruin any possible contacts with Soviet Russia
                        or Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>Germany, he insisted, was not in a “normal situation”. Therefore, it should
                        not be involved in atomic matters. Such involvement would affect not only
                        the Russians but also the French. France could not forget the past.</p>
                    <p>I replied that we clearly had a difference of view as to the safest method of
                        dealing with Germany in relation to the destructive power of the atom. I
                        must point out that, in our view, the history of the last fifty years had
                        demonstrated that German aggressiveness was stimulated by German
                        isolation—by the feeling that Germany was not an equal member of the Western
                        community—and that any discrimination or sense of grievance or inequality
                        would play into the hands of demagogues.</p>
                    <p>In our view we should try, in dealing with Germany, to eliminate any sense of
                        discrimination and to provide the Germans with the feeling that they were
                        equal members of the Western community. We should try to forestall the
                        emergence of a drive for a German national nuclear system by giving the
                        Germans effective participation in some kind of collective nuclear
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>I said further that while it was too late to discuss the question today, I
                        must make it clear that the problem of atomic management remained
                        unresolved.</p>
                    <p>It was a problem of great concern to the United States and we would certainly
                        feel it necessary to have further discussions with the French Government in
                        regard to it at some future date.</p>
                    <p>I thanked General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for the
                        courtesy he had shown and for the observation he had made. He concluded the
                        interview by remarking that great powers have to choose between great
                        difficulties. The United States was a very great power, and our choices,
                        therefore, were exceptionally <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0273"/>difficult. He wished President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to know that France had sympathy for the United
                        States and for him in the problems which they faced.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">Following his visit to Rome, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> returned to Paris, and on August 6
                            he paid a courtesy call on <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                                Murville</persName>. After discussing the situation in Pakistan,

                            talked about NATO along lines similar to the conversation reported here.

                    <p>In a September 1 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                        for the President's evening reading, Executive Secretary Read characterized
                        the conversation as follows:</p>
                    <p>“On the Atlantic Alliance we see no daylight. The Under Secretary made an
                        effective and full presentation of our views regarding the need for
                        continuing effective NATO machinery, including an integrated command system.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s responses indicate no
                        hope that he is likely to change his basic views. He merely offered the
                        possibility that there would be no hurry in bringing about the changes that
                        he wants. He was perhaps clearer and more emphatic than ever before in
                        saying that there could be no foreign forces on French soil except those
                        under French command, and that Germany should not be involved in atomic
                        matters.” (Ibid., S/S–NSC Files: Lot 74 D 164)</p>

                    <p>1. In his farewell conversation with Harlan Cleveland yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">No other record of this conversation has been
                            found.</note> the President made a few comments on nuclear arrangements
                        in Europe which remind me that we have unfinished staff work in this
                        field.</p>
                    <p>2. Harlan opened the conversation by saying that he thought the most
                        important element of his new job was to work on problems on nuclear sharing.
                        The President cut in and said he had two particular concerns here—(1) that
                        he did not wish to pick a quarrel unnecessarily with the Russians, and (2)
                        that he did not wish to get pinned into any position which would not have
                        Congressional support. He made it clear that <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0274"/>before we adopted any new proposal or returned to any old
                        one, we should be sure that we have a position which is understood and
                        supported on the Hill.</p>
                    <p>3. We are evidently a long way from having any such position today. The
                        general language which we have used since last December will not be
                        sufficient in October. In the light of the President's opinions, I doubt if
                        we can return—at least without very careful preparation—to anything like our
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> position of 1964.</p>
                    <p>4. For these reasons, it seems to me essential that we have an early and
                        thorough discussion of this matter, and I will give you a ring to see how
                        you think we should go about it.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I have the following general comment on the Hillenbrand study:</p>
                    <p>The implications of a number of statements, in their collective weight, give
                        the paper a tone and cast that I consider to be misleading with regard to
                        the possibilities of some combination of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a major component in a solution
                        of the Alliance nuclear problem. Specifically:</p>
                    <p>1. The statement that the President has doubts about the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        arrangement should be considered against the different tone of all <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0275"/>official statements of policy
                        approved by him—the December 8 Comments paper, NSAM 322, and the press
                        conference of January 16.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">The December 8 paper
                            is the Attachment to <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>. NSAM No. 322

                            Johnson's press conference on January 16, see <hi rend="italic">Public
                                Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book
                            I, pp. 54–60.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The statement that Congress has voiced serious objections should be
                        considered against the background of virtually no Congressional briefings on
                        the NATO nuclear problem as it stands today.</p>
                    <p>3. The weight of references to opposition by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and the Soviets should be qualified by a realization
                        that these objections go to the root and principle of the idea of a stronger
                        NATO rather than to any specific plan.</p>
                    <p>4. The statement of U.S. policy as one of firm opposition to mixed-manning of
                        submarines is at variance with the NSAM 322 policy statement that it is not
                        precluded.</p>
                    <p>5. The statement that the “<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> approach is incompatible with certain of
                        our major objectives stated in Section II” is not documented and in my view
                        not necessarily true in the case of any one of these objectives.</p>
                    <p>In tone and emphasis there are other features of the study that tend in the
                        same direction—specifically:</p>
                    <p>1. “Consultative” solutions are treated on the same plane as participation in
                        weapons systems. This seems to me to overlook the fundamental distinction
                        that consultation cannot be equated in its political efficacy with
                        meaningful responsibility and that meaningful responsibility involves, as a
                        minimum, a right by Europe to veto the use of a significant part of the
                        Western deterrent if its proposed use is too much at variance with European
                        concepts of timing, strategy or targeting. This inevitably means hardware.
                        And, equally inevitably, it means a segment of hardware less than the whole
                        U.S. deterrent, which we could not responsibly subject to such a veto. A
                        consultative solution relating to the entire deterrent, however ingenious,
                        is incapable of meeting these criteria.</p>
                    <p>2. Some of the specifics of tactics and timing, insofar as they follow from
                        the premises I have criticized, seem likewise to downgrade the most
                        promising approach to that of least promising. There is mention of a
                        possible decision to “let the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept die on the vine or keep it in
                        reserve while moving ahead on some other arrangement”. There is mention of
                        giving priority to overall aspects as compared to nuclear sharing. In my
                        view both the Select Committee and the Paris Working Group should proceed in
                        parallel with equal emphasis and with a business-like pace and purpose.
                        Adjustments to overall tactics should be in <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0276"/>timing of their reports, not the pace of their work. There
                        is no danger that either group will run out of problems to consider.</p>
                    <p>These relatively specific objections should not, however, obscure the fact
                        that this study gives support to many of the major themes and ideas which
                        have needed to be said by an interdepartmental panel. With only minor points
                        of wording or clarification we could, for example, accept all of the summary
                        conclusions as stated at the beginning of the paper. Its emphasis on German
                        expectations regarding <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will make good reading in other agencies,
                        its stress on the need for U.S. leadership at the proper time is salutary;
                        its stress on inter-relationships to the Common Market crisis, the UK
                        financial crisis, and strategy on France and NATO is useful; its emphasis on
                        a variety of parallel approaches as opposed to a single solution is
                        realistic, as is its conclusion that no single preferred course need be
                        decided now. Even in most specifics the judgments expressed are those this
                        Bureau agrees with (utility of sharing R&amp;D, need to deepen
                        consultation on specific nuclear problems, doubtful value of European
                        land-based <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>'s or US-based systems for
                        political purposes, undesirability of new NATO strategic command,
                        desirability of a NATO Defense Minister, desirability of a “political
                        umbrella”).</p>
                    <p>Most cogent of all, perhaps, is the support the study gives to US–UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> talks to develop an overall approach as
                        regards both substance and tactics on the inter-related economic, political,
                        and military aspects of the Alliance problem at this juncture. In short, the
                        report represents a useful contribution to thinking on the problem.</p>
                    <p>My own tentative and general conclusions as to a course of action on the
                        basis of a first reading of the Hillenbrand paper and the staff study
                        prepared in the Department which you sent to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on September 22,<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">Not found.</note> are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. First priority should go to scheduling and preparing for a series of
                            US–UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> bilateral and trilateral
                        meetings on overall strategy and the inter-relationships of Alliance
                        problems along lines set forth in my memorandum to you dated August 19, 1965
                        (copy attached).<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Not attached, but a copy is in
                            Department of State, Central Files, DEF(<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>).</note> We should seek approval of a scenario and
                        schedule before the end of the month.</p>
                    <p>2. Suitable machinery (not too cumbersome) for preparation of positions
                        should be worked out at an early stage. <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                        might assume responsibility for development of positions within the
                        Department and for coordination as appropriate with other departments.</p>
                    <p>3. The examination of positions and alternatives should include a hard look
                        at mixed-manning of UK submarines as the key element in <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0277"/>breaking the log jam on sharing and a
                        German financial contribution to UK submarines. A breakthrough on this point
                        could enable us to see our way through to practical prospects for a solution
                        of at least the “hardware” component of the complex, and that is the central
                        one.</p>

                        recalled that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was an attempt to respond
                        to an initiative taken in Europe in 1960. Our temperature with regard to
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> largely depends on the current
                        attitude in Europe. While there are those who say that we should take the
                        lead, we can't lead if others are not willing to follow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he still felt that if
                        Germany were given possession of a nuclear deterrent we would be on the
                        brink of war with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that giving Germany a nuclear deterrent would also serve
                        to break up NATO. He mentioned in this connection the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is seeking to keep Germany in a
                        secondary position in Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0278"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said he believed that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should not be abandoned. He looks upon
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a means of holding NATO
                        together.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or something
                        close to it is certainly necessary. He pointed to the long-range trend in
                        German attitudes. Even Brandt had recently talked about not having a
                        second-class industry. Given the attitude of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> on Germany, we would invite another Hitler in another
                        ten years.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned also that the leaders in certain European countries
                        must consider nuclear weapons from an operational point of view or they will
                        lose touch with reality. He mentioned the fact that some of these leaders
                        tend to think of nuclear deterrent without giving any thought to what would
                        happen to the areas which they are trying to defend in the process of
                        nuclear exchange.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that under no circumstances
                        can we give the Soviets the impression that we will not use nuclear weapons
                        but that there we must draw the line.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it must also be remembered that the nuclear decision is
                        probably the last decision which leaders in North America would ever make.
                        The assurance lies in the megatonnage which exists in Germany. In this
                        respect the Athens guidelines seem very realistic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> concluded that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is a political instrument which will both
                        aid us in preventing proliferation and serve to strengthen NATO.</p>

                            found.</note> The basic issues for discussion included: (1) France and
                        NATO, (2) Nuclear Sharing, (3) Select Committee, (4) Infrastructure, (5)
                        NATO Force Planning, (6) NATO Personnel, (7) Vietnam, and (8) the December
                        Ministerial Meeting. The recurrent themes of the visit were France-NATO and
                        the nuclear problems.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to last year's visit which was his first to the United States as
                        NATO Secretary General, this was a “working” visit with few formalities.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. France and NATO </p>
                    <p>Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he felt
                        the French attitude had changed recently. It has been generally known before
                        that the French were ready to stay in the Alliance, although they were
                        dissatisfied with the organization. His impression was that France was now
                        disturbed by the German position. The French had offered the Germans
                        reconciliation and had felt they, in return, deserved German support,
                        particularly for the force de frappe. When it became clear such support was
                        not forthcoming, the French turned to the Soviets. The Secretary General was
                        uncertain whether the approach to the Soviets was meant to put pressure on
                        the Germans or was actually the first step for uniting Europe from the
                        Atlantic to the Urals. He said the Alliance could not wait for France but
                        must move forward where possible.</p>
                    <p>In conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, the Secretary General was
                        worried that the French would try to keep US-French differences over NATO in
                        the bilateral channel. It was made clear to him that the U.S. considered
                        this to be a France-NATO problem and not solely a bilateral one. When the
                        French make their proposals we would want to consult other NATO members at
                        an early stage and work out with them how to handle the problem. He was told
                        in general terms of the U.S. tentative studies and of our preliminary
                        conclusion that it would be feasible to relocate facilities in the low
                        countries, backstopped by bases in the UK, if this should become necessary.
                        It would, of course, be expensive and take about three years to accomplish.
                        There would have to be intensive consultation with our Allies before any
                        moves could be undertaken. He was urged to look into contingency steps for
                        facilities and activities under his own responsibility. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> asked to be kept informed of the
                        progress of U.S. contingency plans and was assured he would be kept
                        up-to-date.</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0280"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was glad to note the U.S.
                        position remained that we would try not to provoke a confrontation with the
                        French but were planning in order to be prepared for all contingencies. He
                        was told we are ready to wait until the French wish to make suggestions. He
                        replied that we would continue to press the French to come forward with
                        their ideas.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Nuclear Sharing</p>
                    <p>Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> sought
                        reassurance that the U.S. had not abandoned the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept and asked our
                        views on its relationship to the Select Committee. He emphasized nuclear
                        sharing was a central problem for the Alliance. He was concerned about the
                        “German problem,” making clear he was convinced that Germany must share
                        nuclear responsibility within a NATO framework, otherwise she would in time
                        wish to develop her own capability.</p>
                    <p>He was assured that we recognized that the NATO nuclear problem would not go
                        away. We see <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and the Select Committee as two activities, independently
                        valid and parallel. We are still interested in the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or whatever variation
                        will satisfy our Allies, particularly the Germans. We expect to know more
                        about the situation after Erhard's visit to the United States. We agreed
                        with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not have more of a voice in nuclear
                        affairs, it would in time be driven toward a national nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> brought up
                        the question of non-proliferation, saying there was no danger that either
                        the U.S., Russia, or France would disseminate nuclear weapons information,
                        that it would be easy for Russia to sign a non-dissemination pact as she had
                        no intention of disseminating anyway. The problem thus was not one of
                        dissemination but rather of inducing the Third World of non-nuclear states
                        not to acquire a nuclear capability. Meanwhile all that non-proliferation
                        could do would be to give the Soviets a chance to press to weaken the
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Select Committee</p>
                    <p>This was discussed primarily with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        stated his belief that the Select Committee would have to be constituted on
                        a larger base than originally anticipated. He wondered if he should not
                        chair such an “open-ended” group, although this might cause trouble with the
                        French. In any event he believed the French would not participate. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that, in
                        order to avoid a problem with the French, it might be better for the
                        Secretary General not to chair the meetings. He suggested as an alternative
                        a rotating chairmanship from among the Ministers of Defense. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thought he would probably not attend
                        but would rather send a member of the Secretariat to observe. He thought the
                        French might just possibly attend Select Committee meetings if the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> were
                        not discussed. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        replied that, although we have no objection to the French being there, the
                            <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0281"/>agenda should be for the other
                        members to decide and he could not agree to restrict discussion in order to
                        bring the French in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed
                        with this position. He urged that the U.S. come up with specific proposals
                        to ensure that the first meeting would be a success. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the U.S. would work on an
                        agenda and be ready for a meeting in the second half of November.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">On October 4, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> discussed the Select Committee with Canadian
                            Foreign Minister Martin, who wanted to know how it might work. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that while the
                            committee was not the ideal instrument for solving all nuclear problems,
                            it would be useful in exploring some elements. Speaking frankly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then went on to address
                            the state of the Alliance. NATO was, he said, “made up of minority
                            governments, fragile coalitions, and brittle configurations. The
                            governments of NATO are too weak to lead and too weak to follow. The
                            United States has welcomed the election results in Germany not out of
                            any favoritism for the political parties involved but because the German
                            Government has been strengthened.” (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.,

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he was having great
                        difficulty in getting Europe to accept a larger share. He stated he did not
                        think the U.S. should go below 25% in its support of NATO. He believed it
                        would be impossible to persuade the Allies to agree to a formula which would
                        give us less. He said if he could be assured we would not seek to go below a
                        flat 25%, he would undertake to squeeze the British and the Germans and try
                        to get acceptance of such a solution. This question was left to be worked
                        out further in Paris between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. NATO Force Planning</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> noted that there are two
                        questions—what the Ministers should decide in December and what the Allies
                        are heading toward in the future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that force goals for years had been
                        fictitious, particularly with reference to the logistical support aspect. He
                        did not plan to raise the point at the December Ministerial Meeting that the
                        BRAVO goals cost too much. His preference would be to change the goals to
                        make them more realistic; an alternative would be to label them “Tentative
                        Objectives” and to complement the statement of tentative objectives with the
                        recommendation that the nations should report their plans to meet the goals
                        in the qualitative as well as quantitative sense. Then Ministers could act
                        on the data in May.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> defended the responsibility of
                        the NATO military authorities to make honest recommendations which would
                        naturally be more than what countries would spend. Furthermore, he pointed
                        out that NATO does not have the political power to decide on goals other
                        than those recommended by the military authorities. He asked about the
                        relationship between the contingency studies and forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the studies may show
                        that the goals are not right or that the configuration of <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0282"/>forces is not right. In his view, NATO
                        plans were not adequate and he did not want studies limited to the flanks.
                        The DPWG was doing important work and it should continue its contingency
                        studies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. NATO Personnel</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> asked that the U.S. and U.K.
                        resolve between themselves which should provide the next Assistant Secretary
                        General for Production, Logistics and Infrastructure. He pointed out that
                        this was a key senior staff position which he needed to settle so he could
                        fill a number of important secondary posts as well. He hoped the U.S. would
                        consider filling the secondary post of Deputy to the <gloss target="#t_ASYG1">ASYG</gloss> for Political Affairs which he thought
                        was one of the most influential on the International Staff. He was told that
                        we thought ours the better candidate and that we would discuss the problem
                        with the British.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Vietnam</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was worried by the attitude of
                        Europeans toward the American effort. He said his position was clear, that
                        Alliance members should support the U.S. and that he intended to go on
                        stating this position. He expressed concern at rumors that the U.S. might
                        escalate the situation in Vietnam before long. He suggested it could be
                        helpful to have further <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussions on
                        this subject. This suggestion was welcomed, but with the proviso that there
                        be no question of submitting American decisions in this area for <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> approval or veto. He was assured of U.S.
                        willingness to discuss Vietnam at any time—on brief notice.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. December Ministerial Meeting</p>
                    <p>It was suggested that traditional arrangements for Ministerial Meetings
                        wasted some of the Ministers' time and that it might be worthwhile for
                        Defense Ministers to have private sessions while the Foreign Ministers
                        review the international situation. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he would consider this suggestion. As for the
                        general approach to France in the course of the meeting, he thought he and
                        the Americans were in agreement. No one wanted to act in such a way as to
                        invite a confrontation with the French and everyone, including the Canadians
                        themselves, thought it would be undesirable to continue with the Canadian
                        State of the Alliance initiative.</p>

                    <p>A draft NSAM is attached which incorporates suggested changes as explained
                            below.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">On October 4, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> the texts of a draft NSAM on
                            France and NATO, dated September 25, and a 22-page paper entitled
                            “France and NATO,” also dated September 25. Except for the changes noted
                            in this memorandum, the September 25 draft NSAM is the same as the
                            approved text attached here. (Ibid., POL 1 <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> W–FR) The draft was scheduled for discussion with the
                            President on November 11, but he did not approve nor circulate it as
                            U.S. Government policy. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that the NSAM
                        should begin with a basic statement of objectives which would make it clear
                        that any French actions taken against US installations in France or against
                        NATO are in fact an issue between France and the rest of NATO and not
                        between France and the US. It was particularly important that guidelines for
                        the press should reflect this basic premise. Paragraph one of the attached
                        NSAM embodies this idea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> objected to the statement
                        that we would consider Article V of the Treaty no longer applicable if the
                        French ceased to participate constructively in the Alliance. He thought this
                        was an empty threat and that we might as well face the fact that the French
                        will assume that they have our protection regardless of what we say. If the
                        situation deteriorates sufficiently, an Article V decision would be taken
                        later at the top in the light of the circumstances; it should not be stated
                        now, and perhaps appear in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought it would be most useful to
                        question <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0284"/>the applicability of
                        Article V since this was one of the few areas which might have some effect
                        on the French people. He knew the Secretary felt strongly about this point.
                        It was only reasonable that the French should not profit from Article V if
                        they failed to live up to their NATO commitments under the other articles.
                        The others mostly agreed with him, especially Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who said that if France no longer
                        contributed troops, support facilities, etc., we should not be required to
                        be on record as prepared to defend her. He would have considerable problems
                        with Congress under such circumstances. Ambassador Bruce suggested
                        alternative language which was acceptable to all and is paragraph four of
                        the attached NSAM.</p>
                    <p>General Wheeler was worried about the possibility that nominal foreign
                        command might be accepted as a principle. This works very well in areas
                        where the local people wish to make it work, for instance in Portugal, but
                        the situation in France would be different and difficult. He accepted Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s suggestion that the phrase
                        “multilateral or formally bilateral” be added to paragraph 5c to cover the
                        point. </p>
                    <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>'s suggestion the
                        phraseology in paragraph 6 was changed slightly for the sake of clarity to
                        read “the United States should not make the first move in anticipation of
                        possible French actions against NATO . …”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that although language
                        should not be added to paragraph 8 at this stage, he assumed that the
                        President would want to add something concerning his own responsibility for
                        timing and tactics. The President is determined that France should not be
                        allowed to push the US around, but he will want to play the large cards with
                        France himself; particularly he will want to control what is said to the
                        French and when. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said he
                        assumed that the language to be proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> would relate to discussions with France and would not
                        prevent discussion of contingency planning with others. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> confirmed this. With these comments
                        the group approved the NSAM and the France and NATO paper.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Force Effectiveness </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was worried that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might force us to
                        adjust to a peacetime arrangement which would endanger our wartime
                        capability. He thought there needed to be more studies to check the degree
                        of impairment which might result. There was still time to work on this. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the most recent
                        estimate is February for the French to lay down “conditions” and then offer
                        to discuss them with us. General Wheeler mentioned that General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName> had told General de Cumont that
                        the French want to retain <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> and an integrated command in Germany but
                        abolish <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and veto its establishment
                        elsewhere, with the timing early next year.</p>
                    <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0285"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that unquestionably
                        the French attitude and actions would end up in a weakened NATO ability to
                        exercise a conventional option. This is not logically required because even
                        today, if Germany were attacked we would not fall back into France but would
                        have to use nuclear weapons fairly soon. It would be useful to study and see
                        if there are tactical situations in which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is not an automatic shield between France and the Soviets.
                        We can fight a war without France, but the prospect will lead people more
                        and more to accept the likelihood of a “trip-wire” situation. General
                        Wheeler agreed that, although it is militarily acceptable to think of NATO
                        without France, this would have its effect on military concepts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Germany</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would increasingly make the point
                        that NATO does not apply to Berlin and would exclude the 1958 Ministerial
                        Council decision.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">For text of the North Atlantic

                        NATO-Berlin relationship needed to be looked at more carefully. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> asked whether French
                        troops in Germany are there as a result of World War II or of NATO
                        arrangements. He felt that the legal factors here needed to be pinned down
                        too. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that obviously
                        the French would play their cards on the theory that the troops are in
                        Germany as a result of the war since this is compatible with their ideas of
                        independence, national sovereignty, less integrated NATO activity, etc. They
                        seemed not to care about the effect their position would have on the
                        Germans.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bargaining Assets</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that we seem to
                        have a very skimpy bag of assets with which to threaten or bargain with the
                        French. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed and recalled
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s viewpoints: We are
                        natural allies; France does not need nuclear allies because he does not
                        believe that today there is a threat of nuclear war; also he does not need
                        allies with conventional forces because he considers France automatically
                        protected by German geography. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought, since there was so little bargaining power
                        in the military side of the Alliance, we should look at the European
                        economic relationships for levers. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> and Bator
                        saw little chance. There might be disadvantageous counter-effects if the US
                        tried to push into the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> situation. The
                        best hope was to attempt to stiffen Erhard's spine. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> expected that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might try to blackmail the
                        Germans by offering them a moderately acceptable <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> settlement if they would agree to diminish NATO
                        relationship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> saw no sign of
                        it yet. Ambassador Thompson said that although nobody could be sure how our
                        allies would react as the pressures increased, one <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0286"/>thing is certain—their disposition will be
                        to try to keep France in the Alliance at a considerable cost, probably under
                        terms which would be very difficult for us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that, in dealing with
                        our allies, we were going to have to probe delicately to find out what our
                        real choices are, to discover whether the Belgians, divided as they are, are
                        really going to be ready to accept new NATO responsibility in the face of
                        French pressure. The Netherlands would be stronger as a government, but
                        poorer geographically. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        reminded that one way to get Belgian support was money; i.e. to pay the
                        Belgians for support services, to buy Belgian meat, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> questioned whether the FRG is truly
                        ready to look at the issues and make cold, hard decisions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought it would be important to
                        make it clear to the Germans that the result of French actions might be to
                        weaken the NATO military setup so that the US would find it increasingly
                        difficult to maintain the present level of US forces in Europe. In other
                        words, the problem is not merely that the US may be pushed out of France and
                        into Germany but rather that the conventional NATO strength would be so
                        substantially weakened in the next two years that it would no longer be
                        reasonable for the US divisions to stay in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> commented that, in spite of the
                        military weakness which might emerge two years hence, he thought all the
                        factors, political and otherwise, would lead the US to continue its present
                        policy toward Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tripartite Talks</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> asked how in the
                        period ahead the US should try to exercise its power and with whom. He
                        thought we would make no headway in the European context until we had worked
                        out clear understandings with the UK and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to which the other NATO members could subscribe. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> agreed and thought there
                        should be another meeting of the group in the following week to go over the
                        proper subjects for such tripartite discussions.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">No record of another meeting of the group has been found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> suggested that the subjects
                        should be: (1) the long-term financial problem (pound support and troop
                        maintenance); (2) the collective nuclear problem; (3) non-proliferation; (4)
                        NATO and France; (5) East-West relations; and (6) German reunification. We
                        would first sound out Stewart and Erhard. Then he envisioned high-level
                        talks backed up by technical teams for each of the major subjects. He
                        recognized there would be a problem of publicity. Timing should be sometime
                        late in the winter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> suggested two other items
                        for the list: (1) an Atlantic Arms Market and (2) the Liquidity Problem.</p>
                    <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0287"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said we should work out
                        clear-cut US policies toward each of these areas in advance, something we do
                        not yet have. We also have to keep in mind the cosmetic effect of this
                        activity, which means there should be solid, hard talks separately with both
                        the UK and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> before we go into
                        triangular talks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> approved trilateralism
                        as a substitute for NATO as a means of concerting power. He thought we
                        should try to use this technique wherever possible. He had already revised
                        his ideas about the Select Committee in this regard, and was prepared to
                        have any number join but use a tripartite group to coordinate and run it
                        behind the scenes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> warned
                        that we should be prepared for problems with Italy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said he assumed we would be trying to
                        carry through tripartite efforts in real terms while appearances would be
                        played down as far as possible to take account of the pride of the other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the UK Foreign
                        Minister would be here for talks the following week. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> would see our Ambassadors from the
                        NATO countries on October 25–26. Thereafter we would have papers prepared to
                        get ready for tripartite conversations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said that it would be useful
                        to have clear in our own minds in what order we wanted to talk about the
                        various subjects. Then we could inform the Germans quietly before they came
                        here. He particularly was interested in going further into the nuclear
                        problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that
                        Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> and himself should meet sometime in
                        the following week on the nuclear problem.</p>
                    <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> explained a proposal which he thought
                        might prevent a German national nuclear force and might also be acceptable
                        to Congress. This would include a tripartite statement of principles
                        presenting a collective nuclear force as part of an overall approach to
                        non-proliferation, etc. The nuclear force would be commonly controlled,
                        financed and operated, that is, mixed-manned. The weapons group would
                        include the V-Bombers (mixed-manned), some US and the UK submarines
                        (mixed-manned when no security risk would be involved) and a provision for
                        mixed-manned surface ships in principle but with implementation to take
                        place only when it is agreed surface ships are effective and relatively
                        invulnerable. The force would be commonly financed, but if the necessary
                        mixed-manning were not achieved in a given time, there would be a sliding
                        scale for a reversion of costs. He agreed to send a brief paper explaining
                        this idea to both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>.</p>

                    <list type="subject">
                        <head>SUBJECT</head>
                        <item>France and NATO </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>This NSAM provides the framework and guidance for further discussions with
                        our Allies in dealing with prospective French actions against NATO.</p>
                    <p>1. The basic premise in the US consideration of this problem is that any
                        French action taken against US installations in France or against NATO is in
                        fact an issue between France and the rest of NATO and not between France and
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States remains committed both to the NATO Alliance, as embodied
                        in the 1949 Treaty, and specifically to NATO as an organization.</p>
                    <p>3. The US will not be willing to substitute for an integrated NATO a system
                        of bilateral security commitments incorporating the substance of Article V
                        of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. If France should cease to participate constructively in the organization
                        and activities of the Alliance, the US security commitment given in Article
                        V will obviously have to be re-examined by the President, so far as it
                        relates to France.</p>
                    <p>5. The United States, while remaining prepared to examine French proposals
                        for reform of NATO, will develop its contingency planning with the other
                        thirteen NATO Allies. In this regard, the objectives of US policy are:</p>
                    <p>a. To carry on the common effort with the remaining Allies in NATO regardless
                        of French willingness to participate fully in Alliance activities or French
                        actions which would substantially impair NATO effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>b. To maintain the defensive capability of NATO forces, including the
                        viability of the “Forward Strategy”, and to achieve the optimum military
                        posture attainable in light of French actions.</p>
                    <p>c. To preserve the concept of integration, particularly integrated command
                        and combined planning, in NATO. Modifications in existing relationships,
                        multilateral or formally bilateral, which may be proposed by the French
                        should be considered on their merits; however, the US will resist proposals
                        which significantly impair the peace-time or war-time military capability of
                        the Alliance.</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>d. If forced by France to abandon facilities on French soil, to relocate
                        those forces and facilities essential to the defense of NATO territory.</p>
                    <p>e. To facilitate the ultimate return of France to status of full
                        participating member of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>f. To achieve a common position through consultation with our Allies before
                        any steps are taken in response to French action against NATO or US forces
                        and facilities in support of NATO.</p>
                    <p>g. To make clear to the other Allies that in addition to the defensive
                        measures set forth in this NSAM the US is prepared to explore and cooperate
                        in affirmative actions which strengthen the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>6. The United States should not make the first move in anticipation of
                        possible French actions against NATO or US facilities in France, but should
                        seek through continuing consultation with our Allies a common appreciation
                        of French moves looking toward collective action when and if a confrontation
                        with France becomes unavoidable. In these consultations we should be careful
                        to make it clear that we are not endeavoring to organize the other NATO
                        countries in a campaign to isolate France or to initiate action against
                        France.</p>
                    <p>7. Priority should be given to examining contingency alternatives with our
                        other Allies to determine how and when we should jointly respond to French
                        moves. The primary purpose of Allied consultation should be to establish a
                        consensus among the 14 that the French threat is real and that an
                        understanding must be reached in principle now on the necessity for meeting
                        this threat, if it develops, on a collective basis. Further specific
                        discussions should be held on relocation problems with our Allies, with
                        special attention to those countries most directly affected, e.g., Belgium,
                        the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, the UK and Italy.</p>

                        efforts on this problem.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>—<persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said principal objective now is to get French back to
                        table. Oct 25–26 Brussels meeting of Five and Commission is first step.
                        Purpose of meeting, in Spaak's view, is to make sufficient technical
                        progress on agriculture to persuade French to reopen discussions. Not
                        possible at this meeting to develop positions on questions of majority rule
                        and Commission's powers as French have not made specific proposals on these
                        political questions. Principal dilemma, Spaak said, is that Five do not know
                        what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has in mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> believes French will agree to
                        meet, but not before 1966. In meeting with French, Five must present them
                        with “reasonable proposals”—i.e., modified proposals on agriculture and
                        willingness to explore in depth any French proposals on majority voting and
                        role of Commission. If French decline to cooperate on this basis, Five
                        should react and, difficult as it might be, proceed with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> of Five. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> did not think, however, this eventuality would
                        arise.</p>
                    <p> NATO—Spaak said that again no one knew what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had in mind, and that it important for Fourteen not to
                        leave initiative in his hands, but rather ask French in responsible but firm
                        manner what changes they envisage for NATO. Spaak questioned policy of
                        waiting for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to present
                        proposals as one might conceivably have to wait for 3 to 4 years and Europe
                        cannot hold together that long. (Davignon mentioned on another occasion that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was thinking of asking
                        about French intentions in terms of forthcoming December Ministerial
                        Meeting.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that NATO must continue with or without France, that US
                        has been working on detailed studies on feasibility of proceeding without
                        France if this is found necessary, that he hoped consultations on this
                        subject with our allies could begin in November. The Secretary also pointed
                        out the US has no interest in a series of bilateral <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0291"/>defense arrangements as substitute for NATO
                        and that we have so informed French.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">On October
                            19, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> that the United States had no
                            interest in a bilateral treaty with France and that while the United
                            States opposed West German acquisition of a national nuclear deterrent,
                            the Federal Republic of Germany must be accorded equality within the
                            Alliance. (Telegram 1711 to Paris; ibid., POL 15–1 FR) <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> made these points in a
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de

                            Rambouillet on October 28 (telegram 2337 from Paris, October 28;
                            ibid.).</note> In this connection he said that Congress and American
                        people would not approve of any such arrangement as in US view European
                        nations together are of interest from a defense standpoint, but France
                        alone, for example, is not.</p>

                    <p>They want Germany to participate, multilaterally with the US, the UK and as
                        many other Europeans as they can get, in the common ownership, <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0292"/>management and operation of a substantial
                        strategic nuclear weapons system targeted on the Soviet strategic weapons
                        aimed at Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>They do not in fact believe, whatever we say, that “consultative”
                        arrangements, whether through the Special Committee of Defense Ministers or
                        otherwise, are enough.</p>
                    <p>Their primary argument is that common ownership and management of a weapon
                        will give them more real influence on United States nuclear decisions in
                        Europe—even though they fully agree we should retain our veto—than any
                        possible consultative arrangement which can be devised. I think they are
                        absolutely right on this.</p>
                    <p>I also think that giving the Germans, along with the Dutch, Italians and such
                        others as will join, this enhanced participation in nuclear decisions
                        regarding Europe, is the most prudent, safest course we can pursue in an
                        uncertain future.</p>
                    <p>Mac Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> seems to be dead set
                        against this course of action, notwithstanding the many earlier statements
                        to the Germans by Presidents Kennedy and <persName>Johnson</persName> and
                        yourself that we are ready if they are.</p>
                    <p>I suspect that Mac is mainly concerned about irritating the French. This is
                        reflected in his memos on the subject. But the emerging French policy toward
                        Germany (and toward NATO) is disastrous. If successful, it would destroy the
                        concept of collective effort and restore nationalism as the norm. The worst
                        thing we could do would be to let the French threaten us into following
                        their own policies of division instead of cohesion. The French may flirt
                        with the Russians in order to try to bluff the Germans out of a nuclear
                        arrangement; but that is all. And the Russians will pull out the propaganda
                        stops but in the end will be guided by a cold view of their national
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Your position on this issue will be crucial. I know that you stand firmly on
                        avoiding any commitment in a non-proliferation treaty which would preclude a
                        collective nuclear force with German participation. But more than this is
                        now required. In my judgment the understanding resulting from the Erhard
                        visit will either make or break the collective nuclear project; and the
                        decisions on the United States position may well be taken this week in
                        Texas.</p>
                    <p>I strongly hope you agree that the creation of a collective nuclear weapons
                        system within NATO is in the long-term national interest and that you will
                        take this position in discussions with the President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger said that he wanted a clarification of U.S. policy in
                        the light of the proposals made by Congressman Reuss and by senator Javits
                        to re-examine U.S. policy toward the European Communities and the European
                        Free Trade Area.</p>
                    <p>He recalled that during his tenure in Brussels, he had found U.S. Ambassador
                        Butterworth a warm supporter of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> but
                        somewhat reserved about EFTA.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2"> W. Walton
                            Butterworth was U.S. Representative to the European Communities August

                        Kingdom accession to the European Communities, Ambassador Lemberger thought
                        the United States had become a little less ardent supporter of the European
                        Communities. While the European Communities were still the United States's
                        preferred vehicle for the attainment for European unity, he thought
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJW2">Tuthill</persName> was more
                        open-minded about the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> than his
                        predecessor. Therefore, he wanted to know: 1) whether there had been any
                        change in United States policy with respect to European integration, and 2)
                        whether the United States felt that the Kennedy Round might have to be put
                        off for a year or so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> replied that there was no
                        change in fundamental United States policy with respect to the European
                        Communities, the European <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0294"/>Free
                        Trade Area or the Kennedy Round negotiations. On the other hand, our views
                        did evolve realistically as the objective situation changed.</p>
                    <p>It was clear that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        did not share United States views on the type of Europe that we wished to
                        see created. It was General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s rejection of this type of Europe that had led to the
                        present Common Market crisis. For tactical reasons, the United States had
                        remained publicly silent and had taken relatively little private diplomatic
                        action. This by no means meant a change in U.S. policy toward the European
                        Communities. It was a matter of what tactic was best to avoid giving General

                        exploit our support for the Communities.</p>
                    <p>Statements by members of Congress do not necessarily express the views of the
                        Administration. In the case of Congressman Reuss, the State Department had
                        already replied to him saying that we did not share his appreciation of the
                        situation and had very serious questions about the advisability of his
                        proposed changes in policy.</p>
                    <p>As for Senator Javits' speech in London, it seemed to mark somewhat of an
                        evolution from Senator Javits' position three or four months ago. The most
                        important aspect of Senator Javits' speech seemed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> to have been that he now felt that
                        the first priority for the United Kingdom was to seek membership in the
                        Common Market at an appropriate moment. It was only if this renewed effort
                        should fail that Senator Javits favored a return to his original proposal
                        for a broad free trade area embracing the United States, United Kingdom and
                        others.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Kennedy Round </p>
                    <p>The Kennedy Round negotiations could by no means be written off. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> said that he had been
                        optimistic about concluding them successfully when Austrian Foreign Minister
                        Kreisky had been here.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">Foreign Minister Bruno
                            Kreisky visited Washington October 21–22.</note> His views had not
                        changed. There were a number of signs from the French Government that it was
                        interested in a successful Kennedy Round. One could never be sure, of
                        course, that these signs were conclusive. But there were sound economic
                        reasons that might well lead France to conclude at least a modest Kennedy
                        Round. The great unknown was the attitude of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. There was evidence to support
                        the view both that he would or that he would not favor a successful
                        negotiation. This uncertainty remained even after our recent discussions
                        with Sir Richard Powell. The UK view, otherwise, was also optimistic.</p>
                    <p>The United States very much wanted successful conclusion to the Kennedy Round
                        and we believed that there was some chance of achieving this goal whether or
                        not the French return soon to the Common Market. If the French did return,
                        it seemed quite certain that Germany and <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0295"/>the Netherlands would insist upon a commitment for a
                        satisfactory Kennedy Round conclusion. If France did not return soon, there
                        was increasing readiness on the part of the Five to proceed to conduct
                        Common Market business on an empty chair basis awaiting the French return.
                        Since one of the first major issues that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would have to face would be the Kennedy negotiations, there
                        was some chance that the Five might proceed were they obliged to do so. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, while the French boycott of Community institutions had made
                        the negotiations infinitely more difficult, they had not become impossible
                        and the game would have to be played to the end.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador Butterworth certainly, accurately reflected the attitude of the
                        U.S. Government toward <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. The U.S. was
                        never enthusiastic about it, while it saw a great potential in the Common
                        Market. The U.S. realized that the United Kingdom and Sweden conceived of
                            <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> primarily as a response to the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. It looked to the U.S. like a
                        discriminatory trading block offering no compensatory political advantages.
                        We thought then, and still think, that United Kingdom membership in the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> was highly desirable and it was
                        evident today that various members of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> who were once lukewarm to UK accession, now realized that
                        it would have been highly desirable. France would never have been able to
                        put the whole existence of European integration into doubt had the United
                        Kingdom been a member of the European Communities accompanied, as was
                        likely, by Norway, Denmark, Ireland and possibly Portugal as well.</p>
                    <p>The United States never thought that states unwilling to move toward
                        political unity should be members of the Common Market. It seemed,
                        therefore, inappropriate for either Switzerland or Sweden to join. But the
                        United States always recognized that Austria occupied a special position,
                        had special problems, and deserved some special form of association.</p>
                    <p>The passage of time had caused an inevitable evaluation in our thoughts about
                            <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>First, the Seven had made such important progress toward reducing their
                        duties that one could not easily contemplate a re-imposition of duties among
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Second, thus far the United States had enjoyed greater commercial benefits
                        from <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> than it had suffered commercial
                        disadvantages. We still feared, however, that these disadvantages would
                        become fully apparent only when <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> had
                        eliminated its final internal barriers. The United States and Austria have
                        had similar economic problems vis-a-vis the Common Market. That was one
                        reason that the United States was so interested in an early and successful
                        Kennedy Round.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0296"/>
                    <p>Third, the United States was also fully aware and deeply appreciative of the
                        excellent support which the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> member
                        states have given the Kennedy negotiations. Their success would be best not
                        only for the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and United States, but
                        for Japan and the developing economics as well. A purely European trade
                        solution would be contrary to our interests and would not have our
                        support.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger asked whether the United States still expected any of
                        the political benefits from the Common Market which it had originally
                        foreseen. </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> replied that the United
                        States Government's view, if there were one, would be that it was too soon
                        to know. The play of forces in Western Europe was far from over. We should
                        have to wait and see the eventual result.</p>
                    <p>Speaking personally, however, he recalled that the principal reason for U.S.
                        support of European political unity was in order to find a lasting solution
                        to the problem of Franco-German relations and to the problem of German
                        relations to the West as a whole. We felt that it was essential to give a
                        democratic Germany a viable alternative to a return to nationalism. We felt
                        that tying Germany to Western Europe could help to foster loyalty to a
                        European ideal in place of a national one. The European Communities provided
                        just such an opportunity. They continued to symbolize and to work in this
                        direction. The obstacle to the successful pursuit of these policies was
                        France. This was first evident in its veto of UK accession.</p>
                    <p>The United States always felt that the Community structure tended to moderate
                        nationalistic excesses. Until today, it had no proof of its hypothesis. But
                        now that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wanted to
                        free France of its Community obligations, to get rid of the pro-European
                        leaders of the Community institutions and to change the system of majority
                        voting, we had all too convincing proof that our contention was well
                        founded.</p>
                    <p>European political unity was not close. But we were not prepared to conclude
                        that simply because of the French attack upon it, the objective had become
                        unattainable. We had seen that the Five remained loyal to the Treaties and
                        that they wished to keep the Community institutions alive. Of course, there
                        were differing views on how this should be done. Whether the Five would
                        attempt to do so by making concessions to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> now in the hope that France will mend its ways after
                        his departure, or whether the Five would proceed without France would be
                        seen in the next 6 to 9 months.</p>
                    <p>The Kennedy negotiations and other commercial issues had given the impression
                        of U.S. differences with the Common Market. But this was inevitable and in
                        no sense suggested that our confidence in or support for these European
                        institutions had at all diminished. The fact that the Kennedy Round had been
                        delayed by the inability of the Common <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0297"/>Market to negotiate did not reflect upon the Community
                        institutions but rather upon the Government of France. We saw the Kennedy
                        Round as a test of the liberal nature of Community trade policies. We were
                        being patient and were waiting for the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        to resume meaningful negotiations. We knew that the Government of France was
                        in default of its obligations to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        partners and to its partners in the Geneva negotiations. But we were not
                        walking out of the negotiations. We were waiting and hoped to be able to
                        resume the negotiations in adequate time for their successful
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger agreed that one of the principal justifications for the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had been the achievement of
                        Franco-German rapprochement. But he felt that the European Communities had
                        shown, during the last 2 or 3 years, that they had exactly the contrary
                        effect. The more closely the French and Germans were obliged to work on
                        questions within the European Communities the more friction seemed to
                        develop as the Germans felt compelled to make concessions, especially on
                        agriculture, as the price of increased integration. It appeared to him that
                        these frictions arose because of the Community.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> could not entirely agree.
                        The friction within the Community seemed to him to stem from the decision
                        made by the French to pursue a policy of strident nationalism. The cause for
                        the friction was not the institutions but rather the unwillingness of one of
                        the members to work easily with the others for the common good of the
                        Communities. There has been an unfortunate breakdown in “Community
                        spirit”.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and Economic
                        Union</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger said that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                        fulfilled one of the major conditions that the United States sought in a
                        European grouping that it was outward looking in its commercial policy. He
                        felt that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> would not lead to political
                        unity as this was not one of its objectives. But he did believe that it was
                        moving toward economic union. The members had discovered that the removal of
                        tariffs alone would not suffice. They were being obliged to follow the
                        example of the Common Market in working for the harmonization of other
                        factors, e.g. drawbacks, agriculture and standardization. At the same time,
                        the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> was moving away from its political
                        goals. As a result, he thought that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> were moving closer together and
                        perhaps toward a common structure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName> agreed that the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> was evolving in this sense. He thought
                        that greater <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> policy coordination on
                        technical questions was necessary. The case of the United Kingdom surcharge
                        was a good example. But when experience had shown that the Six had great
                        trouble in attaining this harmonization even when they were committed to it,
                        motivated by a shared political vision, and had institutions to accomplish
                        it, he doubted that the Seven could hope to do better. He doubted that the
                        Seven had enough in common to achieve economic union. He <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>thought the experience with United
                        Kingdom's surcharge was fairly convincing evidence that the Seven were still
                        very far from being ready to coordinate their policies.</p>
                    <p>The case of Yugoslavia seemed to confirm this assessment. The U.S. welcomed
                        the development of closer Yugoslav ties with the West and with <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, but if <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> brought in Yugoslavia, would it not be more than ever
                        difficult to go beyond more than loose policy coordination?</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> would achieve economic union, the
                        U.S. would be delighted. But, it seemed to him that the limited type of
                        economic policy coordination that was likely to be feasible for the Seven
                        was far better suited to achievement within the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. The matters on which coordination might be attained—such
                        as border taxation, standardization of nomenclature, patents, etc., were
                        broader than <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. They were a matter of
                        concern not only for all of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                        countries but some of the Eastern European states as well. The U.S. had a
                        very direct interest in these questions. Therefore, he felt that they could
                        be more successfully dealt with in a larger forum.</p>
                    <p>In resume, the U.S. was prepared to give its full support to genuine
                        political or genuine economic union in Europe but if the relationship among
                        the member states were to be a loose one, then he would hope that it would
                        be at the Atlantic or free world level.</p>

                        Yugoslavia</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger said that he expected the United Kingdom and Switzerland
                        to push for favorable action on the Yugoslav approach. While Yugoslav
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> were stalled because
                        of Yugoslavia's quarrel with West Germany, there was no such obstacle in
                            <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. Although the official response
                        from the Copenhagen Ministerial Meeting was not very forthcoming, this was
                        primarily because the session was principally concerned with <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        bridge-building. Ambassador Lemberger suggested that Sir John Coulson might

                    <p>As for Austria, it had excellent relations with Yugoslavia and important
                        commercial relations. There were neither political nor frontier issues
                        between Austria and Yugoslavia. Austria was, therefore, very receptive to
                        the Yugoslavia approach.</p>

                        should be interpreted to mean that Austria had lost interest in association
                        with the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger said that Austria was still interested but that its
                        negotiating partner was in limbo. In the absence of the French no meaningful
                        negotiations were possible although Austria would continue to go through the
                        motions.</p>

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>. My consultations Nov
                        11 and 12 in Brussels tended to concentrate on link between <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis and “NATO and France” problem. In
                        company with Amb Tuthill, I had opportunity to learn the somewhat varying
                        reactions of four <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commissioners
                            (<persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName>, and Colonna), Dutch <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Spierenburg, UK Amb Majoribanks and, in absence German
                            <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>, his Deputy, Boemcke. Amb
                        Knight and I discussed same problem at length with Spaak, <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> and Davignon at lunch next
                        day. On Nov 15 visit to Bonn subject also arose in meeting with Carstens.
                        Foll observations are composite reaction to these conversations:</p>
                    <p>1. The two “crises” are inherently linked, in that French challenges to
                        European Communities and to NATO stem from the same objection to operational
                        international agencies, and must be faced during same time period. French
                        have not linked the two explicitly, and were even at some pains to deny
                        having linked them when <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> version of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>-Bentinck interview erroneously
                        reported <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> as having made the
                        connection. But in interest politics of each of the Five, and in UK and US
                            <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0300"/>diplomacy, timing of French
                        moves and reactions thereto deserves more explicit consideration than most
                        of us have been giving it.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis is more dangerous for Common
                        Market than “NATO and France” issue is for NATO. Fourteen NATO partners can
                        serve essential purpose of treaty (to defend Western Europe) if necessary
                        without France. France has capacity to defect but not capacity to destroy
                        main elements of present and prospective NATO, including integration of
                        peacetime military planning.</p>
                    <p>In <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Five can, with sufficient will and
                        persistence, stick together and present France with united front. But
                        purposes of Rome Treaty cannot be served by Five acting for themselves, and
                        none of Germany's partners will want to make permanent an arrangement in
                        which Germany is by far dominant partner. For Five to stick together,
                        therefore, is only an interim step which must lead either to (a) forcing
                        France to cooperate after all, for reasons of its own economic interest; (b)
                        luring UK (and presumably Scandinavians) to join Five in setting up a
                        somewhat different kind of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, or (c)
                        both.</p>
                    <p>3. None of the Common Market people with whom I talked seemed to have thought
                        deeply about interaction of two crises. When asked about it, most of them
                        (Mansholt was emphatic exception) expressed hope that we would not rock
                        Common Market boat by pushing <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>-type
                        proposals during next two or three months. If nuclear sharing project is
                        pushed, they thought, it would give <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> additional instrument for blackmailing Five—that is,
                        he could somehow indicate he was tearing down European institutions because
                        we were insisting on giving Germany control of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Arguments for delaying nuclear sharing rest on assumption, which seems
                        dubious, that <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis will come to
                        definitive break or definitive back-down by France within two or three
                        months; but it seems unlikely that things will be that clear-cut that soon
                        or, indeed, ever.</p>
                    <p>In short, instinctive reaction of Common Marketers is predominantly opposed
                        to raising new nuclear issues in NATO, but this reaction seems to me to be
                        based more on instinct than on well thought-out reasoning. Yet one point
                        Colonna made has merit: if you assume (as he does) that <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis will come to a head very soon, it
                        would be better for definitive break with France to come first in a fight
                        between France and “Europe,” and only later in a fight with us about NATO
                        nuclear issues.</p>
                    <p>4. As Amb Knight has reported, Spaak now feels very strongly against our
                        going ahead with nuclear sharing proposal, on ground that this would play
                        into <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s hands. He cheerfully
                        conceded that his present view was not only judgment about what was good for
                        Atlantic and European institution, but also, and especially a judgment as to
                        the difficulty of keeping Belgium firm in an <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> fight with France, given tendency of French-speaking
                        Belgians to accord France benefit of doubt.</p>
                    <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0301"/>
                    <p>5. German reaction from Carstens was to be unimpressed with link between
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and NATO problems. Carstens argued
                        we cannot fail to do what is necessary on NATO side while we await
                        definitive break in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> problem. Such a
                        break, he thought, would require either French change of heart or British
                        decision to join Five, and either development will take a good long time.
                        Carstens thinks that British action may prove useful threat, but that in the
                        end French economic necessities will tend to force a more reasonable
                        attitude in Paris toward <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Recommend that Dept provide all US Ambassadors concerned with its best
                        analysis of this issue. None of us has whole picture, but we all need common
                        basis for judgment about extent to which <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        consideration should be taken into account during very active NATO season
                        which is now upon us. Such analysis also seems necessary as input into
                        recommendations on NATO issues which will be considered by President during
                        next few weeks.</p>
                    <p>7. My own preliminary reaction is that link between two issues is not
                        particularly significant at level of general strategy—in other words, that
                        we should go ahead and do what we think we need to do in Alliance without
                        worrying too much about French objections. But at level of week-to-week
                        tactics and timing, link may prove to be very important—that is, timing of
                        each step we take in NATO should be considered in relation to timing of
                        developments in European Communities, in order not to make things more
                        difficult for Five than they are bound to be anyway.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador Dobrynin and I had the most candid and cordial conversation of our
                        three-year acquaintance today. In approximate order of importance, the
                        topics we discussed are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. European nuclear arrangements. The Ambassador raised this subject toward
                        the end of the lunch—which is where he has usually raised the thing most on
                        his mind in our past talks.</p>
                    <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0302"/>
                    <p>The moment he raised the question, I told him that I was troubled by the lack
                        of clarity in the Soviet position on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and other arrangements. Sometimes
                        the Soviet Union seemed to be saying to us that it was only the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> that was objectionable. At other times
                        Soviet representatives seemed to be hostile to all possible arrangements,
                        even those for simple consultation.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador parried by saying that the Soviet Union had a hard time
                        telling just what we had in mind. He said that he had been unable to satisfy
                        repeated requests from his government for an accurate account of purposes
                        and meaning of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> special
                        committee (even his NATO colleagues in Washington had told him that they
                        honestly did not know what it was all about). The Ambassador said that it
                        would be easier for the Soviet Union to comment on our policy if it knew
                        exactly what that policy was. He said that he knew there was a difference of
                        opinion within the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as between believers
                        in collective weapons systems and believers in consultation. He said that he
                        had the impression that there was not a firm decision in the USG and he
                        implied that the Soviet Union could not express a fully defined position
                        until it knew what it had to deal with on our side.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to the Ambassador that this position in turn created
                        difficulties in Washington. We were determined to move ahead with necessary
                        defensive arrangements, while at the same time we worked for the cause of
                        non-proliferation. The Ambassador was certainly correct in believing that
                        different kinds of arrangements were preferred by different groups here, but
                        I pointed out that as long as it appeared that the Soviet Union was equally
                        opposed to all arrangements, it would be hard for anyone in this government
                        to believe the choice we made would have any effect on relations with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said very earnestly that he understood this point and that for
                        this reason it would be of the greatest value to the Soviet Government if he
                        could have a wholly private and informal indication of the real plans and
                        preferences of the USG as soon as they might be decided. He was sure that
                        such a private indication of our position would be helpful, almost no matter
                        what it was. The Ambassador cited as an example the announcement today of a
                        700-man reduction in our forces in Berlin. He thought that 24-hours private
                        notice of this decision would have been most helpful in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that I understood the value of private communication.
                        The Ambassador, on his part, assured me that the Soviet Union would have no
                        interest whatever in using any such private communication to undermine our
                        relations with the Germans—he said that he thought we worry too much about
                        that, and that this simply was not the framework within which these matters
                        were reviewed within the Soviet Government. The Soviet Government's concern
                        about the Germans <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0303"/>was real and
                        deep, as he had told me often before. The Ambassador remarked that he had
                        often been told by his friends in the State Department that Soviet protests
                        in the nuclear field were merely another example of Soviet hostility toward
                        NATO, and that he wanted me to understand that this was not the case. Of
                        course, NATO was not a Soviet favorite, but the problem of nuclear
                        proliferation and Germany was far different and much more serious. On
                        non-proliferation, he added, the Soviet Government had exposed itself to
                        severe criticism from quarters he need not name (I inferred China); that
                        should prove its sincerity.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that we understood the Soviet concern with Germany and
                        that indeed we shared it. I told him that I could give him categorical
                        assurance that there was no one in the USG who had the smallest intention of
                        allowing the Germans to have national control of nuclear weapons, and no one
                        who would support the Germans in any effort to use any German nuclear role
                        as an instrument of pressure against the Soviet Union. The Ambassador
                        indicated that he believed me, but he made it equally plain that his
                        confidence was not shared in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>My own private and personal conclusion from this extended exchange, the
                        flavor of which I have not fully recaptured, is that we may well be able to
                        win Soviet acceptance of any nuclear arrangement in the West which does not
                        involve an immediate decision to build a new weapons system like the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and which clearly avoids any increase in
                        direct German access to the nuclear trigger. I believe that both the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee and the
                        revised <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> now under discussion could meet
                        this condition. I believe that Dobrynin is right and serious in his emphasis
                        upon the value of early private communication with the Soviet Government
                        when we know our mind on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Since in fact no one now wants the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, I
                        think we may well be able to make some money with Moscow if we tell them
                        privately before we sink it publicly.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I believe that what Dobrynin said on this subject may open the way
                        for us to meet our NATO responsibilities and move at the same time toward an
                        agreement on non-proliferation. At the very least, the Ambassador's position
                        seems to me to reinforce the importance of the President's stated view that
                        we should approach the problem of Atlantic nuclear defense with a full
                        awareness of the concerns of the Soviet Government. (I should add that I
                        told Ambassador Dobrynin that this was the President's position.)</p>

                            November 20, Tuthill said that he had little to add to the analysis
                            transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> Circular 13 on
                            the relationship between the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis
                            and that in NATO. He speculated that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis would probably come to a head first and that the
                            Five could not be counted on to confront <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> unless there was a clear assurance that the United
                            States could be counted on in NATO. The Ambassador concluded that the
                            United States should continue to avoid any public involvement in the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis, but quietly let the Five
                            know that it approved of the firmness and unity they were displaying.
                            (Department of State, Central Files, ECIN 3 <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>)</note> Reftels have provided useful insights into
                        questions of relationship between Common Market and NATO crises and of how
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may combine them to
                        advance his overall objectives. We would welcome further thoughts by you and
                        other addressees, especially since question of how <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may as practical matter be able
                        to put two issues together to his own advantage is at moment wide-open
                        speculation. For time being we have thought it best to avoid attempting
                        guidance from Washington to field proposed in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_circ1">Circ</gloss> 13, which would presume more wisdom
                        that we in fact have. My own present thoughts on these questions follow, and
                        I offer them tentatively:</p>
                    <p>1. Assuming, as I do, that (a) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> is serious in trying enhance French world prestige and
                        power by disentangling France from both NATO and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> limitations on his freedom of action in European, Atlantic
                        and general international fields, and that (b) his genius for tactics
                        remains unimpaired, I expect that he would try to mix NATO and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crises to extent he is capable of levering
                        one against the other in order to give greatest net impulse to his total
                        objective. Question is, what are practical possibilities open to him?</p>
                    <p>2. In <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> faces opposition of other
                        Five which are united against his intent to destroy the integrity and powers
                        of Commission and to alter drastically the present authority of Council of
                        Ministers under the Rome Treaty, both of which institutional arrangements
                        the Five consider essential to progress toward the political unity in Europe
                        that they continue to cherish as ultimate objective. In NATO he faces
                        opposition of all other European countries plus United States, none of which
                        is prepared to disintegrate NATO and thus open the Pandora's box of American
                            <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0305"/>withdrawal, reversion to
                        nationalism and total insecurity that could result.</p>
                    <p>3. What could <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> concede to
                        Five on <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> questions in return for
                        concessions on NATO issues or vice versa without giving up his essential
                        desiderata with respect to one or the other? He is the “demandeur” with
                        respect to both. It is he who wants to alter radically both institutions.
                        But in neither has he anything to offer in exchange except a mitigation of
                        his demands. Conceivably he would be willing to compromise for time being
                        his ultimate requirements regarding the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        in return for support for a specific French program toward NATO. But the
                        French have no specific program for NATO other than the overall objective of
                        disintegration, and this is clearly non-negotiable with the Five.
                        Conceivably also he could offer to relax his generalized attack against NATO
                        if the Five would give him what he wants in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. But the Five know that NATO can survive in integrated form
                        without France. They are most unlikely to make concessions on matters vital
                        to them in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> when they know they are
                        really safe on matters vital to them in NATO regardless of what the French
                        do about NATO.</p>
                    <p>4. There remain four further thoughts which occur to me:</p>
                    <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may attempt to do a deal
                        with the Germans based on a French offer to “live with” the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> (“minor” changes of course in the
                        composition, power and “behavior” of the Commission and a “gentlemen's
                        agreement” on majority voting after January 1, 1966), if Germany would agree
                        to back off from any participation in a common NATO nuclear force. (This
                        would in fact be merely a prelude to a later drive for French hegemony, with
                        further attacks on the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> being withheld
                        only for the time being.) The Germans might be prepared to resist this deal,
                        but I am not sure of their capability to do so without US and UK support. In
                        any case the nuclear issue seems to me the main point at which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may be likely to apply pressure
                        in connection with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may wish to make his
                        foreign policy irreversible within a short time, say the next year or two.
                        If so, he may make an all-out drive to change both NATO and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> drastically and, failing this, may withdraw
                        from the NAT and blow up the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He might
                        move rapidly and “brutally” on both fronts. If this were to happen we would
                        all quickly face a wholly new situation requiring the reassessment of US and
                        UK policy toward the continent in order to preserve essential security,
                        political and economic objectives in European and Atlantic relations.</p>
                    <p>(c) The nuclear problem may have become so important and symbolic to the
                        Germans that they might prefer to reach an early decision to go forward with
                        a common nuclear force and thus present the French with a fait accompli. The
                        German purpose would be to avoid French blackmail, which could be applied
                        more easily during a period of uncertainty regarding any decision to form a
                        common nuclear force.</p>
                    <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0306"/>
                    <p>(d) Europeans could become so frightened of the prospect of being alone with
                        Germany, so awed by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, so
                        doubtful of American constancy, so divided among each other, and so
                        persuaded that a safe deal with the Soviets is possible that they would
                        follow <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s vision of a Europe
                        from the Atlantic to the Urals. I often get frustrated in this job but I
                        don't yet think that Europeans are that dumb.</p>

                        followup work. Immediate effect is public and private demonstration that
                        Alliance is engaged in lively and serious endeavor, that this work has to do
                        with enormous power already made available to Alliance by its members
                        especially U.S., and that work is proceeding in spite of regrettable French
                        abstention.</p>
                    <p>2. Advance arrangements for meeting worked well. All Ministers attending
                        seemed reasonably clear what the meeting was and what it <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0307"/>was not. Nobody tried seriously to convert
                        meeting into a debate on collective nuclear force or on non-proliferation
                        treaty. All procedural arrangements, including terms of reference of three
                        working groups, were cooked ahead of time. With single Dutch exception,
                        composition of working groups, with four nations on each, was also agreed by
                        informal negotiation before meeting started.</p>
                    <p>Moral: When we are reasonably clear what we want to accomplish, we can
                        accomplish much of it by informal negotiation among <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s. Dutch <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Boon strongly recommended his govt be flexible, but
                        unfortunately was overruled.</p>
                    <p>3. Insistence of Netherlands <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> De
                        Jong, backed by Hague Cabinet decision, broke the consensus otherwise
                        established on composition working groups. Result was working groups with
                        five members rather than four. (Dutch position was thus characterized by UK
                            <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> Healey: “If working group had
                        only four members it would lack its fifth wheel”.) Canadians, Turks, and
                        Belgians, all objected to implicit Netherlands assumption that it could
                        represent smaller nations as fifth member working group on nuclear planning.
                        Resulting deadlock was not resolved in spite of much luncheon discussion and
                        some telephoning to The Hague. Ministers finally withdrew into a private
                        room and applied to otherwise insoluble problem the oldest form of
                        collective decision making: selection by lot. That was how Turkey became
                        fifth member of working group on nuclear planning.</p>
                    <p>4. Status of Special Committee is now clear: It is a committee of the North
                        Atlantic Council, chaired by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, with three
                        working groups responsible to it. Special Committee will report to
                        Ministerial Council, but (contrary to hints in French press backgrounding)
                        Council can no longer be considered as being seized with question whether
                        there should be a Special Committee. It simply exists as ad hoc committee
                        whose duration, while not permanent, is indefinite. Further arrangements on
                        procedure, including such issues as chairmanship of and staff work for
                        working groups, will be in hands of steering committee of <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>5. Procedural bridges already crossed include:</p>
                    <p>(a) Agreement that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s report to
                        Council in December will be agreed with steering committee of <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s;</p>
                    <p>(b) Date for next meeting already set for week of March 28, 1966;</p>
                    <p>(c) Members of working groups are <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s
                        or Deputies designated by them.</p>
                    <p>6. Briefings by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> Nuclear Deputy van
                        Rolleghem and International Staff ExSec Coleridge were not a notable
                        addition to meeting, though Coleridge at least was brief. Written briefings
                        and military replies to handful of questions were descriptive rather than
                        analytical. They implied that existing arrangements for planning,
                        communications, command and control, were well in hand and did not analyze
                        gaps or <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0308"/>failings requiring Special
                        Committee's attention. This contributed to feeling by several <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s (notably U.S., U.K., and Germany)
                        that leadership and staff work for working groups will have to come
                        essentially from governments.</p>
                    <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s presentation
                        on nuclear stockpiles, including numbers of warheads in Europe by type,
                        country of location, and nationality of delivery forces (but no information
                        on yields of weapons in Europe), and his revelation of total numbers and
                        yields of U.S. strategic forces, laid down a serious and impressive factual
                        basis for Special Committee's work. Fact this information was made
                        available, under security rules that enabled <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s to use it in their own governments (on a “need-to-know”
                        basis) added greatly to the sense that formation this Special Committee was
                        an important moment in life of Alliance. It also indicated that U.S. really
                        intends to consult more seriously with allies on nuclear questions that
                        affect them. Neither during the meeting nor in informal conversations around
                        its edges did we hear any skepticism of U.S. intentions in this regard.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s backgrounder,
                        using summary numbers for both NATO and U.S. stockpiles, should help carry
                        same impression to press and public at large.</p>
                    <p>8. Apart from U.S. statement, most impressive contribution of substance was
                        made by Denis Healey (UK). He forcefully described need for better political
                        decision-making machinery by drawing from <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> statement the conclusion that NATO arrangements
                        contain “all the hardware we need for any conceivable purpose” and plenty of
                        machinery at military level for release of weapons. But without better
                        political arrangements, he said, both the power and the military release
                        procedures are “irrelevant.” The enemy must know we are able to decide to
                        respond, and allies must have the same confidence. He graphically described
                        the kinds of questions that political Ministers would be bound to ask when
                        death of millions their own constituents was at stake. Task of Special
                        Committee, as Healey described it, was “to build the community of
                        understanding among governments to the level of the community of
                        understanding among their military advisers.” But he also implied that the
                        military advisers were not asking the political authorities the right
                        questions about nuclear warfare.</p>
                    <p>9. Healey came the closest to relating Special Committee to collective
                        nuclear sharing projects. Describing the nuclear planning working group as a
                        device “to consult on strategy involving nuclear weapons,” he said first
                        task was work up realistic alternative plans for deployment and use existing
                        nuclear weapons system, and face difficult issues about development future
                        weapons systems. Only then, he said, can we consider “how to group existing
                        or future weapons systems” in ways that involved collective ownership or
                        control. It would, he said, be “futile” to do this before we know how
                        nuclear weapons would be used.</p>
                    <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0309"/>
                    <p>10. Other statements by Ministers were both mercifully brief and of generally
                        high quality. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> (<gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss>) said no country could depend entirely on
                        decisions by others to ensure its own security, and made clear <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not consider steering committee as
                        substitute for collective nuclear force. “Cannot do the job entirely by
                        technical improvements,” he said. Costopoulos (Greece) put main emphasis on
                        careful study of use of tactical weapons, emphasizing that veto by nuclear
                        powers on nuclear use should be matched by responsibility of those in whose
                        “sector” nuclear weapons were deployed and used. Turk <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> Topaloglu, for whom <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Birgi was mouthpiece, presented a
                        curious proposal to give advance authority to NATO commanders to use
                        tactical weapons bypassing political consultation in an emergency—a proposal
                        unlikely to be heard of again. Andreotti (Italy) made interesting proposal
                        for a “political state of vigilance” as a form of alert to be decided and
                        declared by NATO Council, a low-key alert designed to precede more
                        far-reaching and alarming military alerts now contemplated by NATO
                        procedures. Danish Minister Gram was silent except for brief justification
                        Denmark's presence on committee. Belgian Minister Moyersoen was helpful
                        during argument about composition of working groups, when he emphasized
                        these groups would not have a life of their own but would be under parent
                        Special Committee.</p>
                    <p>11. Hellyer (Canada) asked some perceptive and difficult questions about NATO
                        procedures in event of an emergency. <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> had said he would look to North Atlantic Council for
                        guidance on use of nuclear weapons. But Hellyer wanted to know whether a
                        unanimity rule would apply in the Council on this subject. Could one country
                        veto employment of weapons by a NATO commander? What if one or two countries
                        failed to decide or unduly delayed their decision? What are the military
                        implications of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> having permission
                        from some but not all of the NATO countries? Nobody answered these questions
                        directly. In later discussion of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> role in
                        nuclear decision-making, it seemed to be the prevailing assumption that
                        governments would make their own decisions in their own capitals, but <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> represented useful facility to pool
                        information on nature of crises and to consult rapidly with other allies on
                        their own reactions to and intentions in a crisis.</p>
                    <p>12. Next steps:</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s will have to meet soon to clear
                        up some of the issues of procedure that were left to them by the Ministers.
                        In discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> after meeting, we agreed that U.S. line on
                        procedure for working groups should be to have one member of club assume the
                        chairmanship (U.S. opting to chair working group on nuclear planning), and
                        organize staff work to be done by governments. Thus in case of planning
                        group, U.S. would draft papers, consult quite closely with U.K. and Germany
                        in process, and call the full group in the latter part of January. <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0310"/>Schedule for working groups can be
                        readily arranged while Ministers are together here in mid-December.</p>
                    <p>13. All-in-all, this enterprise is well launched now. Our object will be to
                        maintain sufficient momentum to keep it aloft.</p>

                    <p>1. Tripartite dinner of <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s preceding
                        Special Committee (the three <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s plus
                        three <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s) was significant mostly
                        for being the first of its kind. It produced no notable political backlash;
                        Germans apparently let it be known that von Hassel was dining with US and UK
                        colleagues, but fact was not generally noticed by French press or foreign
                        correspondents here.</p>
                    <p>2. A good part of evening's discussion was devoted to tactics for Special
                        Committee meeting next day, and has been overtaken by reports (<gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> Circulars 18 and 19)<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">
                            <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref> and <ref target="#d114fn2">footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> on that meeting. Three Ministers
                        were in full agreement on such issues as composition of working groups,
                        their terms of reference, nature of report to Ministerial Council and other
                        procedural matters. They also agreed that staff work for working groups
                        would have to be provided essentially by governments.</p>
                    <p>3. Main substantive discussion was touched off by <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>'s reference to existing plans
                        for use of nuclear weapons. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, strongly supported by <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>, told <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName> that in his judgment there exists no rational plan for
                        the use of nuclear weapons now located in Europe. Only real plan is for
                        their use in conjunction with, and if effect as supplement to, strategic
                        weapons in <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and Polaris. But their use in
                        this mode assumed general nuclear war. Far more likely contingency was some
                        form of limited war which raised question of selective <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0311"/>use of nuclear weapons. But there is no
                        realistic plan for selective use, and contingencies short of general war
                        have not been thought through. Nor are there effective procedures for
                        consultation at political level. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized kinds of questions President and his
                        advisers would be bound to ask (and Prime Ministers and Chancellors would
                        ask too) before permitting military authorities use nuclear weapons.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that allies
                        had not even decided how and where arms should be used in Germany.</p>
                    <p>4. Healey chimed in by saying he had initially been somewhat skeptical
                        contribution Special Committee could make. But the more he studied problems
                        nuclear strategy the more convinced he had become that absence of rational
                        plan for use nuclear weapons in situation short of general war was major
                        problem facing Alliance. Special Committee was designed precisely to solve
                        this problem.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> seemed rather taken
                        aback by all this, and kept protesting that he had thought that <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> had a plan for use of nuclear weapons
                        in Germany's defense. The revelation that his colleagues representing
                        nuclear powers were very dissatisfied with the present status of nuclear
                        planning seemed to be a new and sobering thought to <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>.</p>
                    <p>6. In general, neither <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> nor
                        Grewe contributed their share to tripartite discussion. My impression was
                        that <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> felt somewhat out of
                        his league, because he lacked some of the fundamental knowledge and he had
                        not thought as deeply about nuclear defense as US and UK Ministers have
                        done. There may also have been a feeling of constraint and even
                        embarrassment at the company he was keeping—that is, a consciousness that
                        other allies would raise their eyebrows if they knew he was there at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>7. In discussion with <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> today
                        I found he also had been struck by von Hassel's reticence even at an
                        intimate and informal dinner.</p>
                    <p>8. Ministers tentatively agreed that same six (<gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s)

                            commitment to the continent. That way, when such force changes took
                            place in the future because of the situation in Southeast Asia, the

                        Reference is made to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>'s comment in reftel on the need for candor in
                        explaining adjustments in US force strength in Europe to our NATO Allies. We
                        appreciate the difficulties occasioned in reconciling our present policy of
                        unequivocal commitment to hold the line on our NATO committed forces with
                        recent minor adjustments in those forces we have had to make and agree that
                        we should avoid to extent possible further categoric statements on the
                        maintenance of present composition and number of our forces.</p>
                    <p>The adjustments we have made in our NATO forces are thus far minor and
                        demonstrably in line with NATO-wide practices as developed over the years.
                        If we raise the issue at the Erhard level we will be calling special
                        attention to nothing more than minor changes in our NATO forces; a
                        circumstance which would almost certainly be taken as a warning of drastic
                        cuts yet to come. We have no evidence that the NATO governments are troubled
                        by our recent record of force adjustments because of the Vietnam demands;
                        but we know no better way to stimulate European nervousness than to try to
                        anticipate the unpredictable in the interest of candor. To attempt to
                        “explain” our NATO force adjustments to Erhard or any other NATO leader
                        would, we believe, be taken as such a hint of impending substantial force
                        changes, thereby prejudicing the chances of successful negotiations on the
                        military future of the Alliance. Against this background what is required is
                        to draw no special attention to our force adjustments in Europe—even at the
                        cost of leaving a few things unsaid. Meanwhile, it may be possible to move
                        on with the important questions of nuclear sharing and its relationship to
                        conventional force levels in Europe. We therefore subscribe to Bonn's
                        recommendations that we should make no effort to explain our minor force
                        changes to Erhard.</p>

                        were:</p>
                    <p>(1) His strong desire convey to Secretary European concern possibility
                        further escalation Vietnam situation and diminution US commitment Europe. In
                        this connection <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> expressed view
                        Europeans ought increase defense efforts to allow US and Western world in
                        general greater flexibility.</p>
                    <p>(2) France-NATO. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> expects no
                        clear French proposals re NATO, looks instead for bilateral pressures on us
                        which he thinks should be regarded as problem of whole Alliance. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> stressed need for close study
                        procedural aspects France-NATO problem in search of approach avoiding overt
                        14–1 split with isolation French. He particularly critical <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s flirtation Moscow to weaken
                        FedRep. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> expects no softening
                        French position result elections.</p>
                    <p>Secretary emphasized Vietnam, which he told <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> would dominate his speech at Ministerial
                            Meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s speech on the international

                            2574.</note> In speech he would emphasize relevance Vietnam to NATO
                        concerns and call on member nations examine problem from standpoint national
                        interests, considering effect on them if US failed honor Vietnam
                        commitments. Secretary emphasized that Europeans should not see present
                        situation in terms of US choice between Atlantic and Pacific. He pointed out
                        US could not meet commitments in Atlantic without also meeting them in
                        Pacific.</p>
                    <p>Other matters:</p>
                    <p>(1) Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> Tad Szulc
                        story New York Times Dec 13 re Spain-NATO was devoid of substance.</p>
                    <p>(2) In exchange views on recent Soviet developments, including increase
                        military budget, Reston interview with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, resignation <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0314"/>Mikoyan,<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">On December 9, the Soviet Union
                            announced that Anastas I. Mikoyan had resigned as President of the

                        down-played significance, pointed out US had already increased military
                        budget for Vietnam by as great percentage as Sovs now intended do, and that
                        this would look small by comparison with what US would do in January.
                        Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed Kosygin
                        and present collective leadership fundamentally not greatly different from
                        predecessor and, if anything, more orthodox than Khrushchev.</p>
                    <p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he would defer raising
                        agenda item on Cyprus pending arrival of Greek and Turkish <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s from New York. Thought matter would

                    <p>British Prime Minister Wilson visited Washington December 16–18, 1965,
                        primarily to discuss British defense commitments and Rhodesia. In a private
                        conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        at 5:15 p.m. on December 16, the following exchange took place on nuclear
                        sharing:</p>
                    <p>“The Prime Minister expressed warm appreciation for the attitude of the
                        President a year ago on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. When he
                        came here for those discussions he had not known what to expect. He had
                        understood that he would be faced with a ultimatum. Instead, we had acted
                        with reason and with judgment and he thought that events had confirmed the
                        wisdom of that position at that time. He thought all would now agree that it
                        might not have been wise to move ahead rapidly with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> a year ago.</p>
                    <p>“The President reminded <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> of the
                        differences of judgment of the year before with respect to the attitude of
                        the Germans on nuclear matters. He reminded the Prime Minister that the
                        British had then said that the German desire was unreal and had been
                        stimulated by the American proposals. The President had suggested that the
                        British go and test German sentiment. Now a year had passed; what did the
                        Prime Minister think now? The Prime Minister replied, as he had to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in London, the British were still willing to
                        support their own <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposal. They would
                        put their submarines in if the Americans would <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0315"/>put submarines in, and then the Germans could pay for a
                        part in the undertaking. He thought it was all a bit unreal and he did not
                        think we needed as many missiles as we already have in the Atlantic area. He
                        himself thought we ought to consider using the British Polaris as part of
                        some international security arrangement east of Suez. But he was ready for
                        more discussion on the subject.” (Record of meeting by <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Mr. Bundy</persName>; Department of State,

                            November 10, in a telegram to the posts in the NATO capitals, the
                            Department of State transmitted its views on the Ministerial Meeting.
                            Stressing that the United States did not want a confrontation with
                            France on fundamental issues, the telegram emphasized that because of
                            the atmosphere of uncertainty about the future of the Alliance it was
                            necessary to give the meeting a positive air to bolster confidence in
                            NATO. (Telegram 886 to Paris; ibid., Central Files, NATO 3 FR(PA)) In an
                            appraisal of the meeting on December 22, the Department of State noted
                            that this aim had been met and two additional purposes fulfilled: 1)
                            progress was made on several important pieces of Alliance business, and
                            2) <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had clearly conveyed the
                            seriousness of the U.S. commitment to Vietnam as well as the view that
                            Vietnam was important to the Alliance. The Department concluded that the
                            meeting could be described as a successful holding operation for all
                            parties, but with significant procedural movement on some of the
                            Alliance questions. (Circular telegram 1202; ibid.)</note>

                    <p>1. The Alliance</p>
                    <p>This Ministerial session both summarized and confirmed the process of
                        “getting the Alliance moving again” which has been going on throughout the
                        autumn.</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0316"/>
                    <p>A. The new five-year force planning system is a major “reform of NATO.” </p>
                    <p>B. The prospect of nuclear consultations in the Special Committee of Defense
                        Ministers and its three working groups obviously is developing a good deal
                        of interest, and is regarded as forward movement by both friends and foes of
                        farther-reaching nuclear sharing projects.</p>
                    <p>C. We have escalated the Allied mobile force from haggling over finances to
                        fundamental reappraisal by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, with the
                        presumption of proceeding to do what needs to be done on a “less than 15”
                        basis if necessary.</p>
                    <p>D. We have begun to relate the NATO thinking about arms control to the
                        thinking about NATO force planning.</p>
                    <p>E. In short, we have begun a vigorous effort to make more rational use of
                        something like the level of defense expenditures now available to the
                        Alliance. Whether that level rises or falls will depend more on what happens
                        in the outside world than on what NATO Ministers and officials say to each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>2. There were of course two ghosts at the feast: France and Vietnam. The
                        spectre of French obstruction was exorcised with comparative ease. Your
                        presentation on Vietnam was part of a fundamental shift in the terms of the
                        transatlantic dialogue on the non-NATO responsibilities of NATO members.</p>
                    <p>3. France.</p>
                    <p>(A) The frustration of Couve's effort to end the Special Committee next
                        spring can be traced only in part to the reluctance of the French Government
                        to have a major public row with its traditional allies a few days before the
                        run-off election.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">The Embassy in France sent a
                            more detailed report on the French efforts to limit the Special
                            Committee in telegram 3444 from Paris, December 16. (Ibid.)</note> It
                        can also be attributed to the fact that nearly all the Allies, and most
                        French Ministers and officials too, have concluded this fall that a NATO
                        without France is a practical (if inconvenient) proposition.</p>
                    <p>(B) French bargaining power is not very strong with Allies who are
                        increasingly willing to leave the French chair vacant and go ahead on moves
                        to strengthen NATO. The British understand this clearly. The continental
                        Allies sense it too; hence their stiffened posture both in Brussels and in
                        Paris. And the French are increasingly aware of it. The results of the first
                        round in the French elections can be read as providing some mild evidence of
                        this—though Atlantic issues never loomed large in the campaign. More
                        explicit evidence is to be found in Couve's willingness during the Special
                        Committee argument this week to settle for a one-day victory claim followed
                        by a quiet capitulation which did not wholly cancel <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0317"/>the impression of French leadership created
                        in French media the first day.</p>
                    <p>(C) The Ministerial Meeting provided several useful tests of the French
                        bargaining position. Couve's fancy footwork tended to obscure the fact that
                        his attack on the Special Committee was half-hearted and his original
                        statement full of prepared positions to which he could retreat. On two other
                        issues the French did not even bother to challenge positions with which they
                        are known to disagree. They agreed to tentative force goals which carry NATO
                        into its twenty-first year, beyond the magic date of 1969 which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has mentioned so often. They did
                        not speak up on the mobile force, although they had put into a recent
                        military committee report an explicit objection to a statement that the
                        mobile force was important for the defense of NATO's flanks. And when the
                        French tried to rally the other NATO countries against a German request for
                        NATO backing against Soviet attacks, they gave up when they found even the
                        Norwegians would not join them.</p>
                    <p>(D) We have of course not heard the last from the French Government on the
                        duration and functions of the Special Committee, and we are not even at the
                        beginning of the story of French attempts to “reform” NATO and reduce the
                        American military presence in France—assuming <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> is re-elected Sunday.</p>
                    <p>4. Vietnam and China.</p>
                    <p>Your stated concern about Vietnam, which was extended far into the future by
                        Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s remarks on China,
                        formalized and dramatized for our allies and the world the attitude at which
                        we have been hinting for the past three months.</p>
                    <p>(A) On Vietnam in the short run, there is grudging acquiescence that the
                        United States has no honorable alternative to its present course, and we get
                        an increasing playback of the notion that U.S. fidelity to its Far Eastern
                        commitments is important to Europeans protected by the U.S. commitment
                        here.</p>
                    <p>(B) But apart from a verbal dividend here and there, such as <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s impressive statement on Belgian TV
                        December 14, the sources of physical aid to South Vietnam do not leap to the
                        eye. But continuing emphasis may produce a somewhat large non-military
                        presence from Europe, which is something.</p>
                    <p>(C) Ministers can hardly have failed to get the point that increasing
                        requirements for U.S. effort in Vietnam are bound to have some impact on
                        U.S. deployment of NATO support forces. As practical political leaders they
                        can see that with growing U.S. casualties in Vietnam, American opinion will
                        be increasingly impatient with a detached European attitude toward our
                        commitment in Vietnam while they press us to honor every scruple of our
                        pledge to them.</p>
                    <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0318"/>
                    <p>(D) When and if we have to move sizable units out of Europe, it will be
                        important to have made, vigorously and continuously, the point that the only
                        way Europeans can prevent our increasing Far Eastern efforts from degrading
                        NATO is to join that effort themselves. This meeting was an excellent start
                        in that direction.</p>
                    <p>(E) The expressed interest of European Ministers in the conditions for peace
                        has one meaning we should think about. Real military participation by
                        Europeans in the Far East would I believe require a major change in the
                        international framework of the defense of South Vietnam—at a minimum, a
                        system of mutual international commitments that enable other substantial
                        participants in the war to participate in decisions about bombing and peace
                        negotiations as well.</p>
                    <p>(F) When it comes to the longer-run threat of a more powerful Communist
                        China, the assembled Ministers were certainly not stirred into eager
                        acceptance of responsibilities beyond the NATO defense area. But the
                        eloquent and serious expression of U.S. concern has been planted deep in
                        some European political psyches.</p>
                    <p>(G) From conversation around the edges of the meeting this week, I would
                        judge that the most important thing that happened here was to bring home to
                        governments a central fact about the next few years of international
                        relations: that the United States would increasingly judge its bilateral
                        relations with other nations by reference to the degree to which those
                        nations feel responsible for joining us in building a dependable system of
                        peaceful change in the more turbulent parts of the world. Most Europeans
                        have in the first half of this decade started economic aid programs as
                        partial recognition of this responsibility. I suppose it will take the
                        second half of the 1960s to bring them fully into the peacekeeping business,
                        and perhaps longer than that to find the formula for associating them with
                        our determination to teach the Chinese Communists that military militancy
                        doesn't pay.</p>
                    <p>(H) To convert our continental allies from affluent protectorates to active
                        participants in policing world order beyond Europe will be uphill missionary
                        work for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>But I suspect that more than one Foreign Minister will be ruminating on your
                        throw-away comment Thursday morning, that in a world where Chinese
                        Communists have long-range missiles, NATO has to begin worrying about a
                        “Western flank” in the Bering Sea.</p>

                    <p>The President assured the Chancellor that as long as he was in his job and
                        the Chancellor in his, the Chancellor could be assured that there would be a
                        frank and full exchange of views, hopes and expectations. In 1966 Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would be in on the
                        take-off, the flight and the landing.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that was
                        wonderful and very clear. The President could rely on him equally and could
                        have fullest confidence in Germany and the German Government. The Chancellor
                        did not think that the outcome of the French elections had injected a new
                        element into the NATO crisis. The friendship between the US and the Federal
                        Republic was the real foundation of NATO.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor reminded the President that Germany was the first nation to
                        renounce the use of <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons. Germany was
                        looking for a peaceful solution. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did
                        not want national control or national possession of nuclear arms but wanted
                        some multilateral, integrated system. The Chancellor said he understood that
                        whenever there was a development which would bring Germany closer to
                        reunification—which could only be achieved with the aid of Germany's friends
                        and in a peaceful way—at that point Germany would have to make certain
                        concessions regarding borders and other matters. The Chancellor would also
                        be willing to discuss at length any nuclear sharing plan for a reunited
                        Germany. He was looking at the problem without any illusions. The Potsdam
                        Agreement could not stand forever but as long as it was unchanged the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wanted to examine closely any steps and
                        talk about anything that would move the country towards reunification. The
                        Chancellor <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0320"/>assured the President
                        that neither the German people nor he himself were rigid in their
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that when looking at a situation, he was always trying
                        to put himself into the other fellow's shoes. He believed he knew how the
                        Chancellor felt; he knew of the pride of the German people in their
                        accomplishments, of their hope for peace, and their desire to be good
                        neighbors. He personally was not obsessed by any fears about the German
                        people or their attitudes. But he could also understand how the English, for
                        instance, might feel differently. He had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> that he was neither a broker nor a
                        dominator but that he believed he could understand how the citizens of Great
                        Britain and Germany feel. He begged the Chancellor to tell him what he
                        needed to take home to his people. He could not understand, however, why
                        with all the power of NATO and the United States defenses, Germany would
                        want to have nuclear submarines of its own. He could not understand why the
                        Germans would want to buy something that the United States had already paid
                        for, when <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> all trusted each other. He was
                        committed to the defense of Western Europe for otherwise he would call US
                        troops home tomorrow. If the Germans wanted to spend a lot of money and the
                        United Kingdom wanted to make contributions, however, he would certainly be
                        willing to listen to their suggestions. How final action would be taken was
                        not really important, but it was acting that counted. He had told Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> that he would listen to
                        his suggestions regarding submarines or other campaign promises but had
                        added that he would listen to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> first before agreeing to anything. He asked the
                        Chancellor to comment, since the Chancellor knew the German people better.
                        The President could not judge from what he reads in the newspapers, but he
                        wanted to assure the Chancellor that his problems were also the problems of
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied he thought the present position of NATO was somewhat
                        unstable and that there might be a closer integration of NATO allies in the
                        nuclear field. This had nothing to do with distrust, however, and he did not
                        think anybody was worried. The President holds the last word in nuclear
                        decisions. The Chancellor thought there were too many differences among the
                        fifteen partners at the NATO talks in Paris. Each one wanted to state his
                        own case. If a multilateral solution could be found, with limited
                        participation at the onset, the other partners could then gradually join
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he believed such a closely-knit multilateral system would
                        provide more of a deterrent vis-a-vis the Soviets. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not of course want to shoot. Nuclear
                        sharing was, moreover, not only a military question but also had political
                        implications. De Gaulle had once said that a nation protected by others with
                        no say of its own could not regard itself as truly sovereign. The Chancellor
                        was the last one to believe <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0321"/>that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s pronouncements
                        were the ultimate wisdom, but he saw some truth in this particular
                        statement. The United States, Great Britain and Germany should get together
                        and find a basis for multilateral arrangements. At a later date the Italians
                        and the Dutch might join. Some form of nuclear cooperation might be found
                        which gives more emphasis on defense matters to the European Community
                        without disrupting the US defense structure.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor emphasized that Germans realized they were affected by US
                        efforts elsewhere in the world, for instance in Viet-Nam. The FRG realized
                        the heavy burdens the United States is bearing. What happened outside of the
                        NATO territory was also of concern to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was considering
                        how it might contribute more in the future. With the rapid rise of
                        technological development in China, the Russians might one day start looking
                        East and there might be an opening or a possibility for peacefully settling
                        the question of German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that many find non-proliferation attractive, but
                        agreement on non-proliferation presupposes agreement on nuclear sharing. It
                        was impossible to assume that Germany will go forever without a nuclear
                        deterrent—this was the position of the German political parties. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was not so much afraid of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s but was concerned about the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s. There were supposedly about a thousand
                        of them targeted on West Germany and Europe. The question was how Europe
                        could protect itself against them. The Soviets also had mobile rocket units
                        with a range of about 1,200 miles.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said a fully integrated system would be the best solution. It
                        would prevent Germany from taking the lead, even in the hypothetical event
                        that some criminal—as had happened once before—would come to rule the
                        Federal Republic. Such an integrated system, especially if it were coupled
                        with a unified Germany, would also be in the Soviet interest.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said some nuclear scientists had told him that in the not too
                        distant future nuclear weapons could be produced much more cheaply and
                        technological aspects mastered more easily, so that many smaller countries
                        would be able to afford nuclear weapons and might actually find them cheaper
                        to maintain than conventional forces. With this in mind, a system could be
                        worked out in the future which would allow as many countries to get inside
                        an integrated NATO system as would want to take part. Non-nuclear powers
                        could elect to participate or not. In this way there would be no
                        discrimination. Each country would make its own decision. In summary, such
                        an integrated force was the best guarantee of peace.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that with regard to non-proliferation he did not see
                        how much could be accomplished as long as the Viet-Nam problem was in the
                        way. He would discuss this thoroughly with the <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0322"/>Chancellor's government, however, in conjunction with the
                        Chancellor's nuclear sharing ideas.</p>
                    <p>The President said he sometimes thought the best solution would be for the
                        British to get rid of their submarines, give up their own nuclear deterrent
                        and let the United States, which is committed to the defense of Europe,
                        assume all its defense alone.</p>
                    <p>[At this point, the Chancellor gave the President a draft plan on nuclear
                            sharing.]<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Brackets in the source text. A
                            copy of the draft plan was attached to <ref target="#d121">Document

                        nature of the paper and asked the President to read it and give him his
                        comments during their next meeting.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting the Chancellor said that he would like to
                        pursue further the subjects of nuclear sharing and non-proliferation and
                        that he and the President would stay in touch with each other on these
                        matters.</p>

                    <p>It was agreed that they should discuss first the question of nuclear sharing,
                        which had been raised in the discussion earlier in the day between the
                        President and the Chancellor;<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d119">Document 119</ref>.</note> the Secretary emphasized
                        that we should not make another false start in nuclear matters. The proposal
                        put forward by the Chancellor should be discussed thoroughly <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0323"/>between the US, UK and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> governments before a new step was taken.
                        The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> whether
                        or not the German paper which the Chancellor presented to the President
                        constituted an adequate basis for such a discussion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> did not seem to think that
                        the actual paper itself could constitute such a basis. He urged that careful
                        thought be given to the presentation to be made to the UK, Italians and
                        Dutch on this subject. Two lines of argument must be developed, one for
                        internal use between ourselves, and another for anti-propaganda use against
                        the Soviets. It was first necessary for the US and German governments to
                        reach agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that this raised a problem. When UK Prime Minister
                        Wilson was here last week he had wished to reach some agreement in principle
                        on this question. However, we had advised him that we thought it best to
                        wait until we could talk to the Germans. It is now also hard for us to agree
                        bilaterally with the Germans. Somehow tripartite US, UK and German talks
                        must be precipitated. He thought it possible that such discussions could
                        result in agreement. There would be a distinct advantage in the UK putting
                        its nuclear forces into NATO. The US Government might also be willing to
                        follow with some type of contribution to a collective system. He suggested
                        that the present anti-nuclear sharing propaganda campaign could be blunted
                        if only existing weapons were to be used in the system.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> responded that, since his
                        visit to London, he believed that a cornerstone to any possible multilateral
                        force should be the British <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. The UK
                        nuclear force, however, should not be put into NATO before a combined force
                        was created, after which the combined force itself could be put into NATO.
                        From the German point of view the US <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        proposal was the best system which had been presented to date, i.e. it was
                        mixed-manned, subject to joint use, etc. Perhaps it is these very qualities
                        which have rendered it unacceptable to others. The Germans understand this.
                        They are thinking now only in terms of the UK Polaris submarines, which will
                        be coming out between now and 1969, the US Polaris, perhaps the V-bombers,
                        perhaps the next generation of Pershings, and even the F–111s. He indicated
                        that he would be willing to show the paper the Chancellor had submitted to
                        the UK.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary raised the question as to whether it would be possible to
                        assign such a force to NATO without the approval of the French. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> replied that the German Foreign
                        Office experts had concluded that this was possible. The Secretary agreed
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> that the UK
                        contribution should be made after, not before, the combination of the force.
                        The UK could give consideration to its own contribution. The Americans and
                        the Germans must not, however, in the meantime, pre-sent any final decision
                        to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0324"/>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out in this connection the present de facto situation
                        affecting German participation in nuclear matters. Germany has, in fact, an
                        equal voice in nuclear decisions within the Alliance just as it does in
                        decisions affecting conventional forces. Although Germany is without a
                        formal veto over US nuclear weapons in Germany, the de facto situation is
                        that we cannot operate in the Federal Republic without their approval. Due
                        to the presence of one quarter million American troops in Germany, it would,
                        moreover, be difficult or impossible for us not to become involved in the
                        event of hostilities on German soil.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that in his
                        view the Germans should communicate in some way directly with British Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>. Unfortunately it
                        would not be possible to arrange tripartite talks. The Italians, Dutch and
                        others would be quite concerned. Perhaps an exchange of letters between the
                        Heads of Governments, i.e. between the President and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, and between Erhard and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, would be the best way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said then that he had at
                        noon today agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that no new additional nuclear forces are required.
                        Germany relied on the US entirely, under the terms of the Athens guidelines,
                        in the case of both nuclear weapons in Germany and the US nuclear deterrent.
                        Germany wished, however, to share in the “handling” of nuclear weapons. It
                        was not any question of lack of confidence in the US. Bilateral relations
                        between Germany and the US are extremely close. Communications can easily be
                        made back and forth through visits of Ambassadors, without arousing any
                        notice. It is, however, harder to bring a third country into such a
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that the Defense Ministers meeting planned for
                        Washington in January might be a good place to advise the Italians and Dutch
                        about plans for a multilateral nuclear system. In the meantime, letters can
                        be written by the President to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        and by Erhard to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> raised the question of
                        contacts with the Italians. Carstens mentioned that they would be in his
                        office day after tomorrow and that he must know what to say. Knappstein
                        referred to the fact that the Italian Ambassador to the United States was
                        breakfasting with him the same day. What would he tell him? <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> would be in Washington Wednesday.
                        What should he be told? <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                        commented that <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> was not the
                        best contact possible within the Italian Government. Others would have a
                        more sympathetic view toward a multilateral nuclear system.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> suggested that three of four
                        points might be isolated from the German proposal for disclosure to
                        interested governments: (1) The fact of the force. (2) That it would be
                        subject to common decisions. (3) That no emphasis is being placed on any
                        particular type of weapons for inclusion.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, the Secretary said that in his talks with the Chancellor at

                            1965</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I have just completed a day and a half of meetings with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in which we have had a good
                        opportunity to talk not merely about the problems presently occupying the
                        German leaders, but also the need for the Federal Republic to play a role in
                        world affairs more nearly commensurate with its resources.</p>
                    <p>In the course of our discussion the Chancellor presented the case for
                        Germany's participation in some form of collective nuclear defense—a
                        question on which his Government is placing considerable emphasis. In order
                        to make clear the nature of the German interest he gave me a memorandum, a
                        copy of which, with his permission, I am enclosing.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As you will note, the Chancellor has come down squarely on the side of a
                        “hardware solution.” I know of your own reservation about this matter and I
                        have taken them into account in my discussions with the Chancellor. I have
                        explained to him that the point of greatest importance was for the three of
                        us to reach an agreement that could form the basis for the possible
                        participation of other powers.</p>
                    <p>The proposals presented by the Chancellor will give me some problems with
                        Congress, and I am sure they will not be easy for you. But what <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>is essential is a stable and healthy
                        Germany that can play a constructive role on the side of the West. On
                        balance it seems to me that you and I should make a serious effort to
                        respond to the German proposals as the Chancellor has broadly outlined them
                        in his memorandum.</p>
                    <p>The nuclear force he describes would appear to fall within the broad
                        framework of your <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> proposal. Unlike the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, it would not contemplate the
                        creation of a new weapons system. From our discussion, it would appear that
                        the Chancellor and his Ministers have been generally thinking in terms of an
                        assignment by the United Kingdom of its Polaris submarines and a matching
                        contribution of Polaris submarines by the United States. These submarines
                        would form the basic elements of the force, which might be added to later.
                        It is our impression that the questions of mixed-manning, veto rights, and a
                        “European clause” can be worked out in a manner consistent both with your
                        requirements and ours.</p>
                    <p>I think it important that we move ahead on this expeditiously since the
                        matter has been so long in limbo. I would hope, therefore, that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> might have a talk with you
                        when he returns to London about the middle of January. He will bring with
                        him suggestions as to the best way to carry on the necessary discussions
                        among our three Governments in as quiet a manner as possible. Meanwhile, I
                        should greatly appreciate your comments on this development.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">On January 5, 1966, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> replied thanking the President for this letter
                            and saying that he had also received a message from <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> who was pleased with his talks in
                            Washington. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> agreed that
                            some of the German proposals would raise difficulties for both the
                            United States and the United Kingdom, and that they should receive
                            expeditious treatment. The Prime Minister went on to express his
                            pleasure at the establishment of the Nuclear Planning Group of the NATO
                            Special Committee, which would help Erhard pre-sent the German position
                            on nuclear problems. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                            concluded by telling the President how glad he was to hear that the
                            creation of a new weapons system was no longer contemplated. (Department

                    <p>Four general lines were stressed:</p>

                        take further initiatives to revitalize Atlantic partnership idea;</p>
                    <p>B) War in Viet-Nam occupies America's full time and attention and U.S.
                        therefore interested only in peace and quiet in Europe;</p>
                    <p>C) Washington, intent on detente with Soviet Union, prepared to make great
                        concessions at Europe's expense, to come to terms with other superpower; and </p>
                    <p>D) U.S. unwilling to confront French on important issues of NATO or nuclear
                        problems and Europe would do better to accept maximum of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s theses on organization of

                        before it was too late.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> called on the
                        Under Secretary on December 30 to protest vehemently that according to a <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi> article of December 15, the Defense
                        Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany had had a
                        second tripartite dinner meeting hosted by the British NATO Permanent
                        Representative, Evelyn <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>,
                        December 14 during the NATO ministerial meeting. Referring to the first such
                        dinner hosted by Ambassador Cleveland on November 27 during the Select
                        Committee meeting, Fenoaltea said he had accepted the explanation that the
                        first occasion was “more of a dinner than a meeting” and did not constitute
                        any institutionalized procedure. The fact, however, that the second dinner
                        held with the British rotating as hosts seemed to indicate clearly that the
                        United States, the United Kingdom and Germany are establishing a clandestine
                        tripartite steering committee in addition to the three Working Groups of the
                        Select Committee.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">Regarding the first and second
                            tripartite Defense Ministers meetings, see <ref target="#d114">Document

                            thereto.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> then gave a
                        charged review of the reasons why any such U.S.-U.K.-German maneuver
                        represented a tragic mistake not only insulting to Italy but capable of
                        producing most serious repercussions there. These included weakening the
                        pro-NATO, stabilizing Italian Center elements, strengthening extreme
                        rightist and leftist groups, creating anti-U.S. feeling while enhancing
                        Gaullist appeal to the Italians, and destroying sense of Italian community
                        of interest with the West Germans.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> added that the
                        United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy form natural pillars upon which
                        integrated Europe would eventually rest and to exclude Italy, was like
                        cutting off a leg from a four-legged table.</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>Emphasizing that tripartite trysts also violate the spirit of a commitment
                        made to Italy in connection with its membership on the Select Committee,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> declared: “These
                        tripartite dinners must stop!”</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that
                        frankly he was unaware of the second dinner but agreed with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> that any policy of
                        building on a tripartite base would be a great mistake and contrary to U.S.
                        policy. Replying to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName>'s assertion that this problem involved a most
                        important foreign policy issue, the Under Secretary said that he would take
                        the matter up with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and reassured the Ambassador that it is not our
                        intention to proceed on a tripartite basis.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> thanked the Under
                        Secretary for his assurances, adding that he, too, might wish to talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about the matter on
                        some appropriate occasion.</p>

                    <p>1. I should report a conversation between the President and <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName> last week,<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Bruce talked with the President at 11:15 a.m. on
                            January 14. His summary of the meeting accords with the one presented
                            here although he adds that <persName>Johnson</persName> instructed him
                            “to hold the 'PM's feet to the fire' on previous statements of his
                            willingness to negotiate on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>.”
                            (Ibid., Bruce Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> because of the light it
                        throws on the President's current thinking about Atlantic nuclear
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> asked the President for
                        guidance in the light of the exchange with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName> in which the President said that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> would be prepared to pursue the
                        subject on his return to London.</p>
                    <p>3. The President expressed his own support for a solution in which the
                        British would put in some submarines, and we would put in some <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0331"/>submarines, and the Germans would put in
                        some money. He forcefully stated his belief that it is necessary to keep the
                        Germans with us so that they will not get cut loose and become dangerous
                        again.</p>
                    <p>4. At the same time the President explicitly rejected <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName>'s suggestion that he make a firm
                        decision now to do all that might be necessary to bring about British
                        agreement to this course of action. The President is not ready at this time
                        to make a hard issue of this question with the British. He believes that
                        discussion should continue in an effort to see whether agreement can be
                        reached between the British and the Germans without strong U.S. pressure on
                        either one.</p>
                    <p>5. My own impression is that the President is sympathetic to the German
                        desire for a “share,” but strongly aware of the opposition which such an
                        arrangement might produce among important groups here and abroad. He wants
                        to go ahead with it if agreement can be reached by the normal process of
                        negotiation and discussion, but he is not willing to apply pressure at this
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>6. The President and David agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> should report orally to the Prime Minister that these
                        matters are still under discussion here and would be discussed further after
                        your return from Asia. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> will
                        also indicate that he should have more to say after his next visit to
                        Washington, which comes at the end of this month, in connection with the
                        Cabinet-level discussions on the British Defense review.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">On January 20, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> why no message had come from the President on
                            nuclear sharing. As instructed he reminded the Prime Minister of his
                            offer to negotiate on <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> replied that he was ready to do
                            so if the United States wanted to. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. I report this to you because there continue to be members of this
                        Government on both sides of this question who instinctively and insistently
                        press their own preferred tactics without making sure they are in line with
                        the President's thinking. We have paid a price for this kind of pulling and
                        hauling before, and we ought to try to avoid it this time.</p>

                    <p>Agree that Germans should have immediate and authoritative response to their
                        query as to what US position would be on Five negotiating for Community. You
                        are therefore authorized to inform Germans at appropriate high level as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p> US is negotiating in Kennedy Round with Commission acting on behalf of
                        Community. Whether Commission's instructions come from Six member States or
                        from Five acting for Community is internal matter for determination by
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> members involved. If Five decide to
                        give Commission instructions enabling it to resume effective participation
                        in KR, US would be prepared to proceed with negotiations on that basis.</p>
                    <p>It is important that it not become known that that we have responded to
                        Germans just prior to Luxembourg meeting. You should therefore ask Germans
                        to keep fact of our response in strictest confidence.</p>
                    <p>Other addressees may in their discretion state this position if asked.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he had to leave for a
                        brief engagement but suggested that the meeting proceed to a discussion of
                        NATO, and commented that he believed our positions were quite close together
                        in this area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> considered that the problem
                        of forces in NATO was in many ways more political than military in nature.
                        He believed we all feel that some reductions in Europe would be possible
                        militarily, but that the beginning of reductions might unravel commitment by
                        others. This was our principal concern here. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that we face a combined
                        military and political problem. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        military force structure was unsatisfactory and their defense budget was
                        inadequate. He did not believe the US and the UK were justified in going on
                        with their contributions to the defense of Europe unless the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> changed the direction of its decisions of
                        the last 9 months. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had a paper army,
                        the real “stage army”. We were willing to tolerate myths for a time after
                        the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0334"/>German forces were organized in
                        the 1950's, but not indefinitely. He said the German commitment is 12
                        divisions; they have only 240,000 men to man these divisions plus all their
                        supporting elements, infrastructure, etc. The US would have 600,000 to
                        800,000 men to provide a 12-division force. There have been two defense
                        budget cuts in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the last few
                        months. The weakness of the German army means that there is a physical
                        danger to the flank of the US Seventh Army.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued that, a few
                        months before he died, President Kennedy said he would not accept for
                        another year this relationship between the inadequate German force
                        contribution and ours. The situation is worse now than it was then. A
                        solution requires two actions: first, a modification of our force structure,
                        and second, a substantial increase in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> financial and force contribution. There is a serious
                        political problem in that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is very
                        unrealistic in their reaction to modifications in allied military forces in
                        Germany. If we withdraw a battalion, it is taken as an indication that we
                        are modifying our political commitment. There must be changes in force
                        structure, as technological advances justify change. This would mean lower
                        foreign exchange costs for us. He noted that such a change would also be
                        beneficial to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> because they would
                        have less to offset if some of our forces were withdrawn. Realistically the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> cannot continue indefinitely to
                        provide a full offset.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he did not want to
                        see a military weakening of NATO, but he also did not want to see
                        unnecessary forces and related foreign exchange costs. There is a need for a
                        more realistic <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> appraisal of the military
                        effects of force modifications. He believed the British could withdraw some
                        air force units to be based in the UK and that the US could also, but we
                        would need to get the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to support this
                        politically. He noted that the Belgians and others are waiting for an excuse
                        to cut their own military expenditures, and a chain reaction could set in
                        with cuts in Italy, the Netherlands and further cuts in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> itself. Such a reaction could be triggered
                        by <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> statements that the US and UK are
                        reneging on their commitments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not believe the
                        political leaders in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had been well
                        advised by their military leaders on our strength and their own weaknesses.
                        He suggested that General Wheeler and Field Marshal Hull should work on
                        their counterparts in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> did not know that he had a
                        paper army and an absolutely inadequate defense budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we must do part of this task
                        through military channels and part through political channels. He noted many
                        signs that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was moving away from
                        their offset agreement with us. The Germans do not believe they need larger
                        forces, and do not understand the relative strength of our forces and the
                        weaknesses of their own. He urged that the British talk bilaterally with the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on this problem and indicated that
                        the US would also do this.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0335"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> thought an adult education
                        task confronted us but we could not wait for it to take effect. He suggested
                        that political pressure must supplement the education program. He noted that
                        18 months ago the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> looked like the best
                        place for the British to make savings in their military expenditures,
                        including foreign exchange. They found, however, that redeploying forces to
                        the UK would involve a large budgetary increase to provide facilities for
                        the forces. Also, the British could not disband forces they might take out
                        of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> because they now serve as part of
                        the UK strategic reserve. He noted again that while the Defense Review has
                        been going on, British military tasks have increased. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said to reduce the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> would make it appear that the UK was
                        opting for outside Europe rather than into Europe. It was hard for the
                        British to pressure the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, but if no
                        foreign exchange savings could be made, the British would be forced to make
                        cuts in their forces in Germany even at the budgetary expense of building
                        facilities in the UK.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that we get
                        the following message to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>: First,
                        tell them through military channels that their political leaders need to be
                        educated concerning the weakness of their forces, a situation we cannot
                        continue to tolerate. Second, tell them that their defense budget must go
                        up, which should result in more procurement, some of which should go to the
                        US and UK as offsets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said
                        we both have a strong interest in getting a more realistic <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> view. He made reference to the proposal to
                        the Permanent Council of NATO for a study of comparative balance of payments
                        costs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> commented that
                        he was not optimistic on this; NATO studies do not usually lead quickly to
                        agreements. He noted that both the British and the US need results in a
                        matter of months, and suggested further bilateral action. Mr. Stewart added
                        that although it was an immediate problem it will also be a continuing
                        problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and
                        said he did not oppose the idea of a NATO study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said all this arises at a
                        point in time when we expect a <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> initiative or “deinitiative”. He raised a question as
                        to whether we should not do more bilateral contingency planning now
                        regarding actions the French might take. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> saw no objections to “invisible discussions,” but
                        stated the US did not want to create the appearance of an Anglo-American
                        cabal in NATO. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said
                        information on possible French moves has varied; at one point it was thought
                        the French might take some initiative in March, but now it seems more likely
                        that it will be June. He suggested that the French will probably not wish to
                        mix the NATO problem and the Common Market problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out we need to
                        avoid the impression that we are collaborating against the French; in
                        addition, the problem is not really a complicated one. Because of the danger
                        of leaks, and because the problem is not complicated, we are reluctant to
                        undertake bilateral contingency <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0336"/>planning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> saw the problem
                        as being somewhat academic unless we also go to the Belgians and the Dutch
                        concerning alternative sites. With the extreme sensitivity of the French and
                        their disposition to use for their own ends any appearance of a US/UK
                        initiative, it appeared unwise to push bilateral planning now, at least
                        until French actions seem clearer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said it is also possible
                        that as a consequence of the election results <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> may speed up his timetable. It would be good for other
                        NATO nations and for France to realize that we could carry on if necessary
                        without France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented we
                        have had bilateral discussions with several NATO nations, and they all seem
                        agreed to carry on in NATO without France. The problem is one of preparing
                        to adjust to unknown French demands but discussions of specifics such as
                        relocation of lines of communication, headquarters, etc., are almost too
                        sensitive to get into now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested we leave this problem for another thirty
                        days and consider it again when Mr. Healey returns in February. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> agreed but commented he
                        was worried that we were trying to handle a series of interdependent
                        problems independently. The Special Committee, the German defense budget,
                        etc., are all related to French attitudes. He was not confident that this
                        was a fully integrated operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said there are two possibilities: first, we could have
                        quiet bilaterals now on the NATO posture, assuming the French make a move,
                        but without provoking them; second, we could delay detailed contingency
                        planning until we know more about French intentions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then suggested that the press
                        people might be brought in at this point to decide what should be said to
                        the press. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said it would
                        be helpful if we could say that the US reaction was not one of shock. Mr.
                        Stewart agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked
                        whether the British would say that they intended to keep a world role. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> replied this was their
                        intent. (There was a discussion of a draft memorandum for the press that had
                        been prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>.)<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Not found.</note> Mr. Healey observed that the UK
                        was faced with the ghastly problem of trying to present the Defense Review
                        at home as a bold new look but at the same time reconciling this with the
                        requirement not to “pull down the pillars of the temple” overseas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> suggested that information
                        to the press should start with a UK statement on maintaining their world
                        role followed by a statement that they must consider how this is related to
                        UK resources. Then there should be a statement that some adjustments will be
                        required but that major economies can be achieved without loss of strength.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> stressed the need to avoid
                        giving the Australians the impression <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0337"/>we are ganging up on them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> thought the meeting today should be portrayed as the
                        beginning of a process which would proceed further in Canberra. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said he would like to
                        indicate that the US is satisfied with the broad picture presented by the
                        British and that there would be a long period of cooperation in working out
                        details.</p>

                        and NATO. They probably calculate that resolution <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis on their terms, thereby weakening German position in

                        probably in spring 1966. Earlier French reckoning may have been that <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> “crisis” could be resolved by early spring,

                            Europe, but added that it was easier to define the problem than to know

                            February 7–8 might further the growing gap. Since he had an appointment

                            indicate U.S. interest in French-German relations and encourage the

                        the Secretary. Obviously the United States has a fundamental interest in
                        good relations <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0339"/>between France and
                        Germany. We ourselves have been drawn into two world wars that had their
                        origins in Franco-German hostility. It would be a great thing for us to be
                        able to say once and for all that war between France and Germany was
                        unthinkable—after all these centuries.</p>
                    <p>That does not mean that we are interested in good Franco-German relations “at
                        any cost.” The crisis in Europe results from French efforts to promote the
                        supremacy of narrow French nationalism over the common interests of the
                        others. Because the Five have recognized that the attempt by Paris to
                        emasculate the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> was against their own
                        economic and political interests, they have been able to make progress in
                        settling the Common Market crisis. If the Five continue to hold the line
                        there is a good chance that the French will retreat further and progress
                        toward European integration can again resume.</p>
                    <p>We have thus far scrupulously avoided taking sides in this intra-European
                        controversy. At the same time we have continued to reaffirm our convictions
                        that European unity and Atlantic partnership are essential to long-range
                        stability in the West. A decent Franco-German understanding lies at the
                        heart of European unity but centuries of experience have shown that it can
                        be achieved only in the context of a larger European arrangement, and not
                        through a bilateral agreement between two ancient rivals on whom history
                        sits heavily. This is sound policy and we should continue to pursue it.</p>
                    <p>Any suggestion to the Germans that we favor concessions to French nationalist
                        ambitions either in the European or NATO contexts would discourage a process
                        that so far seems to be producing useful results. Certainly, we have nothing
                        to gain and a great deal to lose by encouraging accommodation with a French
                        policy which, if successful, would fragment Europe and divide the Atlantic
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The present French leadership responds to firmness and exploits any whisper
                        of weakness. Its national policies run athwart our own conceptions of how
                        Atlantic power can be best organized and Western interests secured. We
                        should not display any lack of confidence in our own positions or any
                        willingness to compromise them in the interests of a transient amity between
                        France and Germany—and this applies to nuclear and offset arrangements, as
                        well as other elements of policy.</p>
                    <p>For all these reasons we should avoid making any suggestion to Erhard that he
                        should try to improve his relations with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> by concession or accommodation to
                        French demands. Certainly there is no harm in suggesting the utility of
                        Franco-German collaboration on such matters as the improvement of relations
                        between Western Europe and Eastern Europe. But I have some misgivings about
                        your talking with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in terms of
                        general and necessarily rather vague principles that could lead to
                        inferences of ambiguity as to our own policies or <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0340"/>intentions. It would seem better to direct
                        such a conversation to particular questions directly affecting the relations
                        between our two countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">On February 4,

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I appreciated receiving the frank comments in the Department's telegram No.
                            1865,<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">
                            <ref target="#d128">Document 128</ref>.</note> but was frankly a little
                        surprised. You seemed to have read into my telegrams 2266<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">See <ref target="#d128fn2">footnote 2, Document

                            February 4. (Department of State, Central Files, POL FR–<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> views which I had not meant
                        to put there. This letter is intended, therefore, to clarify several points
                        on which there appears to have been misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>I did not intend to suggest in the referenced telegrams that we seek to
                        improve German-French relations “at any cost”, nor that we urge upon
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that he try to improve
                        relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> by
                        “concessions or accommodation”. Neither did I wish to recommend that we
                        permit or urge the “compromise” of any policy consideration important to us,
                        including what we really want to come out of the NATO nuclear sharing affair
                        and our offset agreement with Germany. Indeed, one of the arguments in the
                        reference telegram was that, since no accommodation on important outstanding
                        issues between France and Germany is now possible, emphasis should be placed
                        on atmospheric and secondary policy considerations. I share the view that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> cannot be permanently
                        bought by such concessions, which would merely enhance his appetite.</p>
                    <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0341"/>
                    <p>On the other hand, it will be easier for the Germans to stand firm on
                        important issues if they have a good record of meeting the French half-way
                        on the less important ones—where there would be justification, irregardless
                        of whether <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or someone who
                        sees Europe as we do, was President of France.</p>
                    <p>I agree that the apparent victory achieved by the Five over France at
                        Luxembourg is an isolated illustration of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will change his attitude when he
                        comes up against a stone wall. There can, however, be no permanent solution
                        to the European problem through the Five. Germany cannot take the place of
                        France, nor the Five the place of the Six. The other four cannot live with
                        Germany alone for deep-rooted historical reasons. Until the time actually
                        comes that Europe can be enlarged to include England and others—which does
                        not now appear likely—the Five, and particularly Germany, are thrown back on
                        the necessity of dealing with France.</p>
                    <p>I agree that the ultimate resolution of the relations between Germany and
                        France, as between all of the European countries involved, should lie in a
                        multilateral context. This has been the thrust of American policy in the
                        entire post-war period. French-German relations, however, because of their
                        very weight among the Six, and historic French-German rivalries, assume a
                        significance far beyond that of other European bilateral relations. We
                        cannot fail to recognize, moreover, that, largely as a result of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s efforts, French-German relations have been
                        deliberately lifted out of their multilateral context. To use a physical
                        term, they have become polarized. The attractive polarity which was first
                        thought to exist between the two countries and which, had it progressed at
                        the same pace as the development of unity efforts generally in Europe, might
                        have contributed to European unity, has now become a repellent or reverse
                        polarity. It constitutes a new drag on European unity, and must, I believe,
                        be dealt with.</p>
                    <p>The question I raise is not one of “taking sides”, either as between Germany
                        and France or the Five and France. Everybody knows which side we are on
                        without our saying so. Indeed, we did not hesitate to advise the Five
                        privately about such matters as the importance of the Commission, which was
                        one of their disputes with France. The question I raise is rather one of
                        seeking to remove ourselves, without sacrificing our own vital interests, as
                        one of the sources of aggravation between Germany and France. It is not a
                        question of paying for a transient friendship between Germany and France out
                        of those vital interests, but of avoiding the defeat of our own concepts of
                        a long-range partnership with Europe by actions which, in themselves, could
                        foreclose the possibility of European unity. Naturally, we should not under
                        any circumstances “encourage French nationalistic ambitions or accommodation
                        with French policies which would fragment the Atlantic world”. However, it
                        is not <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0342"/>only French ambitions, but
                        the deteriorating French-German relationship itself, which could result in
                        this fragmentation. De Gaulle may be in for a long time, and it is entirely
                        possible that he could, in his present mood, drag French-German relations to
                        a low point of no return.</p>
                    <p>There are many contradictory elements underlying the concept of European
                        unity and the Atlantic partnership. If we are to succeed in both, I believe
                        we must not let one get ahead of another. Compromises must be effected all
                        along the way. An uncompromising Atlanticist attitude which leaps over
                        Europe altogether, such as that van der Beugel proposed at the Bilderberg
                        Meeting in Como last spring and which was turned down unanimously by the
                        Europeans present, could I believe only end in our failure on both
                        counts.</p>
                    <p>Given these considerations, I would, as indicated in my telegram 2343, hope
                        that further consideration could be given to the broader reconsiderations on
                        Franco-German relations made in my 2266. The problem is a serious one
                        requiring, I believe, our closest attention.</p>

                        referred to in Circular 1514:<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">In circular 1514,

                            there was a growing need for a draft paper to form the basis of

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> give this paper initially
                            to the Common Market members of NATO and the United Kingdom as a
                            preliminary statement of U.S. thinking. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> also reported that this paper was a sanitized text
                            of the NATO-France paper prepared in the fall as a draft NSAM (see <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>) and asked for comments on the
                            draft. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 4 NATO)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Basic premise in U.S. consideration of this problem is that any French
                        action taken against U.S. installations in France or against NATO <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0343"/>is in fact an issue between France
                        and rest of NATO and not between France and U.S.</p>
                    <p>2. U.S. remains committed both to NATO Alliance, as embodied in 1949 Treaty,
                        and specifically to NATO as an organization.</p>
                    <p>3. U.S. would not be willing to substitute for integrated NATO a system of
                        bilateral security commitments incorporating substance of Article V of North
                        Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. U.S., while always prepared to examine on their merits French proposals
                        for reform of NATO, wishes develop its contingency planning with other
                        thirteen NATO Allies. In this regard, objectives of U.S. are:</p>
                    <p>a) To carry on common effort with other Allies in NATO regardless of French
                        willingness to participate fully in Alliance activities or French actions
                        which would to varying degrees impair NATO effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>b) To maintain defensive capability of NATO forces, including viability of
                        “Forward Strategy,” and to achieve optimum military posture attainable in
                        light of French action.</p>
                    <p>c) To preserve concept of integration, particularly integrated command and
                        combined planning, in NATO. Modifications in existing relationships,
                        multilateral or formally bilateral, which may be proposed by French should
                        be considered on their merits; however, U.S. will resist proposals which
                        significantly impair peacetime or wartime military capability of
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>d) If forced by France to abandon facilities on French soil, to relocate
                        elsewhere those forces and facilities essential to defense of NATO
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>e) To facilitate ultimate return of France to status of full participating
                        member of Alliance. </p>
                    <p>f) To achieve common position through consultation with our Allies before any
                        steps are taken in response to French action against NATO or U.S. forces and
                        facilities in support of NATO.</p>
                    <p>g) To assure other Allies that in addition to defensive measures described
                        here, U.S. is prepared to explore and cooperate in measures which strengthen
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>5. The Allies other than France should not make first move in anticipation of
                        possible French actions against NATO or U.S. facilities in France, but
                        should seek through continuing consultation among themselves common
                        appreciation of French moves looking toward collective action when and if
                        confrontation with France becomes unavoidable.</p>
                    <p>6. Primary purpose of Allied consultation should be to establish a consensus
                        among fourteen that French threat may be real and that <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0344"/>understanding should be reached in
                        principle on necessity for meeting this threat, if it develops, on
                        collective basis.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">With the exception of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, who thought
                            the tactics for consultation seemed sensible, the Ambassadors to whom

                            of a small NATO nuclear consultative committee consisting of the United
                            States, France, Italy, West Germany, and the United Kingdom, which would
                            be a substitute for a multilateral weapons system and would assist the
                            U.S. President and the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, with respect to
                            the planning and use of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed for the defense of
                            Europe. (Ibid.)</note> I plan to discuss your proposal with the
                        Secretary or the Under Secretary when they have had an opportunity to study
                        it. Meanwhile, my own feeling is that this matter is best left alone for the
                        time being. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> made
                        known the clear views of the German Government in the memorandum which he
                        left with the President. The President promised that the United States would
                        discuss the German memorandum with the British and authorized Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to do so. These
                        discussions have not yet taken place for a number of reasons. Various
                        consultative approaches, as you know, had been very thoroughly studied here,
                        with the help of Embassy Bonn, prior to the Chancellor's visit. To revert at
                        this point to a consultative proposal would in my view be tantamount to
                        rejection of the German memorandum even before the discussions which we
                        promised to hold with the British were begun. </p>

                    <p>This is not to say that some nuclear consultative arrangement may not
                        eventually emerge from the discussions going on in the Special Committee.
                        These discussions have just started and will undoubtedly continue over a
                        period of at least several months. It is entirely possible that they will
                        result in recommendations for an effective system of nuclear consultation,
                        which would be all to the good and which, in my view, has an importance
                        quite independently of the idea of a collective nuclear weapons system. But
                        for the U.S. at this juncture to come forward with a consultative system as
                        a substitute for the German proposals in a probably vain effort to satisfy
                        the Soviets on non-proliferation would, I am afraid, constitute a breach of
                        faith with the Germans. I have not commented on the specifics of your
                        proposal, which raise a number of questions, since, as I say, I feel
                        strongly that the matter should be left alone for time being.</p>

                        Ministers had done their homework, partly on the special flight together
                        Wednesday. Discussion around table among them achieved an intimacy and a
                        relevance quite out of the ordinary for international meetings, especially
                        on so complex a subject. </p>
                    <p>It quickly emerged that there was a consensus on the adequacy of existing
                        strategic nuclear forces, though perhaps there were still some <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0346"/>questions about whether more of the total
                        force should be in Europe (the “<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        issue”). It was therefore decided to try to capture and record this
                        consensus as part of the concluding action document which sets forth the
                        Working Group's future program of work.</p>
                    <p>As you will see from the agreed conclusions (in separate telegram),<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">Circular telegram 1573, February 18. (Department

                            that the size of NATO strategic nuclear forces was adequate to deter a
                            large-scale Soviet attack, but there appeared to be no way to prevent
                            unacceptable damage to the West from an all-out nuclear exchange. The
                            Defense Ministers also instructed their Deputies to prepare studies for
                            further consideration on tactical nuclear forces and participation in

                    <p>As you leave for Moscow, I want to share my thoughts with you on one further
                        problem that you have occasion to discuss with the Russians. This is the
                        problem of relations between the negotiations on non-proliferation and our
                        efforts to get an agreed Atlantic nuclear policy. I think we have to walk a
                        careful line between contending groups which would give one or the other of
                        these related problems an overriding priority.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government continues to assert that any form of cooperation with
                        Bonn in the nuclear field is dangerous. While this position <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0347"/>may in part reflect a genuine concern about
                        the Germans getting control over nuclear weapons, it is also plain that the
                        Soviets are seeking to use the issue as a means of causing trouble in the
                        NATO Alliance.</p>
                    <p>The main point of Soviet tactical pressure in the coming weeks is likely to
                        be the language of the non-proliferation treaty. They will be pressing for
                        language which would bar what they call “access” to nuclear weapons by
                        non-nuclear powers. Their evident purpose is to foreclose the possibility of
                        nuclear arrangements in NATO which would involve the Germans more intimately
                        in the business of nuclear defense.</p>
                    <p>We are inclined to think that the best way to counter the Soviets on this—and
                        to get on with a constructive treaty—is to focus discussion on the true
                        meaning of proliferation, and, at the same time, to convince Moscow that we
                        will not sign a treaty which would rule out NATO nuclear arrangements which
                        would not, in fact, involve proliferation.</p>
                    <p>In our new draft treaty, we have suggested that proliferation results when a
                        non-nuclear nation acquires its own national control, or the right or
                        ability to fire nuclear weapons without the concurrent decision of an
                        existing nuclear nation. In addition, there should be no increase in the
                        number of states and organizations which have control of nuclear weapons. In
                        general, the draft represents an attempt to come to grips with the real
                        problem of proliferation without sacrificing the legitimate interests of the
                        non-nuclear members of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>In any case, I think it most important that we not let the Soviets maneuver
                        us into a position which would arouse strong and honest resentment in
                        Germany. To let them do this would be no service to the cause of
                        non-proliferation, since it would increase the very dangers that the Soviets
                        constantly stress.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government is surely not blind to one further aspect of this
                        matter—namely, that there is on this issue, a pronounced difference of
                        emphasis between your public opinion and ours. They are bound to see
                        advantage in trying to exploit that difference to set us against one
                        another. We must be careful not to fall into that trap.</p>
                    <p>My own view is that we should keep an absolutely even handed view of these
                        twin problems. A sound non-proliferation agreement and a sound Atlantic
                        nuclear policy are in truth mutually consistent and reinforcing. I do not
                        accept the argument that we must finally solve the Alliance nuclear problem
                        before there can be a treaty. But I think we should equally reject the
                        notion that we can push aside the Alliance problem now, and go along with a
                        treaty which would rule out, or drastically narrow, possibilities for a NATO
                        nuclear arrangement which would not result in proliferation.</p>
                    <p>On non-proliferation, we can meet the legitimate interests of the Soviet
                        Government because they are the same as our own. But we must not let the
                        Soviet use this most important issue to undermine German <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0348"/>confidence in our willingness to treat
                        their nuclear problem seriously and constructively. This course naturally
                        tempts some in Moscow, but it is no more in the Soviet interest than in
                        ours.</p>
                    <p>I thought it would be useful for me to give you this indication of my own
                        thinking, because of the great advantage which comes to us both when we
                        stand together.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will have a good trip and I send you once again my best wishes for
                        success in your effort to get Soviet help in reconvening a Geneva
                            Conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">On February 26, following his
                            return from Moscow, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> reported that the 3-day visit was “hard
                            pounding.” He noted the Soviet obsession with the prospect of Germany
                            obtaining access to nuclear weapons. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> told the President that he had

                        American agreements covering our facilities in France; a withdrawal of

                    <p>1644. For the Ambassador from the Secretary. I transmit for your background
                        and guidance the following commentary on US policy as it <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>relates to France, and the distinction that
                        should be made between the foreign policy of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and our continuing friendship,
                        courtesy and respect for France and French officials:</p>
                    <p>The election of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        for another seven-year term is a suitable time to review US policy toward
                        France. He is opposed to basic US objectives, such as a strong NATO, a
                        unified Europe and US efforts to maintain freedom in South Viet Nam. These
                        strongly held, personal views of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> are unlikely to change. They are largely based on his
                        messianic belief in the glory and importance of France, and thus are not
                        subject to reasoned argument. Attempts to propitiate President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> are unlikely to succeed and would
                        probably only serve to increase the level of his demands.</p>
                    <p>Policy toward President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        cannot be considered in isolation. It is and must remain an integral part of
                        our over-all foreign policy. While it would be possible to devise a US
                        policy which could bring about an accommodation with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, this would require abandonment
                        or modification of major US objectives. Such a price is far too high to pay,
                        particularly in view of the recent evidence that President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does not presently have majority
                        support in France for many of his policies. The US should make no
                        substantial concessions to the policies of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, but should pursue whatever
                        policies it finds appropriate, irrespective of his position.</p>
                    <p>In arriving at decisions on over-all US policy, little weight should be given
                        to Gaullist views. We should operate on the assumption that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s leadership of France
                        is temporary, and that he will be succeeded by a government more responsive
                        to public opinion, hence more favorable to NATO, to a United Europe and to
                        the United States. However, in arriving at important policy decisions we
                        should give due weight to basic French views and interests as opposed to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s personal
                        predilections. It may be difficult to sort things out in this manner, but we
                        should make the attempt.</p>
                    <p>While continuing firmly on our course in spite of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s views, we should lean over
                        backward to be polite and friendly to France, to President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> personally, and to all French
                        government officials. Backbiting, recriminations, attempts to downgrade the
                        importance of France as a nation, or attempts at reprisals should be avoided
                        no matter what the temptation. They cannot be effective, will only irritate
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and make him more
                        difficult to deal with, and are likely to cause French public opinion to
                        rally to his side against the US.</p>
                    <p>If President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> insists on the
                        removal of US forces from French soil, we should accede gracefully and
                        should move promptly to consider repositioning our line of communications
                        elsewhere. Attempts to dissuade President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> or to obtain various concessions would <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0351"/>seem to be unwise, although it would be
                        helpful if France would maintain the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> in
                        a caretaker status. If France should decide to pull out of any active role
                        in NATO, we should not replace our NATO tie with France by any bilateral
                        agreement. Any such agreement would make it much more difficult for France
                        to return to the fold at a later date and might set a pattern that could
                        undermine the whole NATO structure. In the event of a French withdrawal, we
                        should support the continuation of the NATO organization without France.</p>
                    <p>We should maintain our support for the Common Market, taking care that we do
                        not seem to take the lead in any effort to isolate France. If France is to
                        be isolated, it should clearly be by her own doing and not as the result of
                        American efforts.</p>
                    <p>In the event of French withdrawal from NATO, the Common Market or other
                        international bodies, it should be made very clear to French public opinion
                        that there is an empty chair always ready and waiting for France should she
                        decide to return. This could be of major importance in maintaining the
                        friendship and confidence of the French people as opposed to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and his personal
                        followers. We should continually work to preserve this basic friendship
                        despite any annoyance with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> or his government.</p>
                    <p>Finally, President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s growing
                        fear of Germany, plus his desire to cast France in a leading world position,
                        may induce him to go to unusual lengths to reach an understanding with the
                        Soviet Union. This would be particularly likely if France should withdraw
                        from NATO or substantially loosen her ties to the other Common Market
                        countries. We should always bear this possibility in mind. If it comes
                        about, we should react calmly and philosophically, based on circumstances at
                        the time.</p>
                    <p>In summary, we should continue quietly and firmly on our course, ignoring
                        Gaullist objections but always showing respect and friendship towards him
                        and the French people, while awaiting the day when a more friendly and
                        cooperative government comes to power in France.</p>

                    <p>5561. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> opened our conversation by
                        saying President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had asked
                        him to deliver letter to President Johnson <note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">
                            <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note> to me and was sending
                        information copy to Lucet (original was handwritten by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>). He added this was to make
                        approach more formal (“plus solonnel”). He said purpose of letter was to
                        make clear <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s intentions and
                        position. He added similar letter would be written to certain others
                        (British, Germans and Italians) during this week.</p>
                    <p>After reading note, I asked if this represented denunciation of agreements.
                        At this juncture Couve simply replied letter is to inform us of French
                        intentions. Couve went on to say that French have told us before that they
                        would inform us of their plans in March 1966 but this did not mean intention
                        to effect plans then but to give sufficient time before 1969, so plans could
                        be made tranquilly (“tranquillement”). He said French position had been
                        agreed on for long time. He said some thought French had changed position
                        because of forthcoming elections and he said Lucet now reported from
                        Washington we thought it was to act before Moscow trip. He concluded this
                        was childish (“enfantillage”).</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> then repeated other leaders
                        would receive similar letter later in week but U.S. as leader of Alliance
                        approached first. He stated next week all fourteen governments would receive
                        diplomatic note which would spell out in more detail French plans. He
                        pointed out U.S. most concerned with NATO while three countries—U.S., Canada
                        and Germany—concerned with bilateral arrangements but he quickly added
                        Canada was minor problem and German agreements were satisfactory as no
                        German commander was involved. U.S. bilateral agreements, and he listed five
                        principal ones, were, however, important.</p>
                    <p>I asked again if this were denunciation or proposal for negotiation.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said both and neither but
                        admitted he failed see a priori how we could agree. I pressed again asking
                        if it were French position that all U.S. troops should leave. I noted we had
                        many installations here and this letter really offered nothing, and sounded
                        like a denunciation. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said yes
                        if we wished (“oui, si vous voulez”) i.e. it was denunciation. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> reiterated letter was to inform us of
                        French plans and French had been saying this for years. I pointed out
                        General had always spoken of reforms <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0353"/>to NATO and had indicated on February 11<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">On
                            February 11 at the State dinner for the diplomatic corps, <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> had spoken briefly to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> who stated that France
                            desired to maintain the Alliance but change its organizational
                            structure. (Telegram 4853 from Paris, February 11; Department of State,

                        would discuss this problem with me before action. This action I said
                        represented decision without any consultation with us or the allies. I said
                        it would be problem in Franco-American relations and in the whole Western
                        security concept. Under Secretary had made it clear to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in August 1965<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">See <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> that
                        we considered North Atlantic Treaty and organization as a whole and on this
                        basis U.S. had made Article V commitment. I added that in order to make
                        clear that our commitment under Article V was serious and in effect 100
                        percent we had supported the set up of the organization, had stationed a
                        considerable quantity of troops on European soil in order to reassure our
                        allies. I added I wondered if it were possible to accept thesis of an
                        alliance emptied of content and I wondered if this were not even a violation
                        of treaty. This was also a juridical question I noted which was under study
                        in Washington. I thought the consequences of the French action would be
                        immediate and clear, for example, it would be impossible to leave nuclear
                        warheads with French forces in Germany if they were not earmarked for
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> stated Under Secretary had
                        already made similar points to Lucet.<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">See <ref target="#d134fn4">footnote 4, Document 134</ref>.</note> He said
                        France had always said she would not denounce the treaty in 1969 but for her
                        part felt it should continue. He interpreted U.S. position as meaning we
                        must keep not only treaty but all its accretions since 1949. Treaty when
                        ratified by U.S. and French Parliaments in 1949 not at all now what it was
                        then. Alliance was not automatic in principle, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> noted. French, however, say treaty should continue
                        even though world situation not what it was in 1949. France wanted an
                        agreement on these issues but it seemed impossible to obtain. He said we
                        seemed to think Article V was unilateral commitment but said only case when
                        it arose since 1949 was in Cuban case of 1962, when France had stated her
                        intention to carry out obligations. I pointed out to Couve that Article V
                        had never entered into the Cuban crisis nor had it been mentioned by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> when he assured us of
                        his support. He did not pursue this subject.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> then added this seemed odd
                        procedure where U.S. was already discussing Article V commitments with
                        France's other partners behind her back. If an attack came, he said, it
                        would not be against France but probably against <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and here we were pushing France towards neutrality in such
                        a case. He wondered if all of our military paraphernalia here was not
                        useless anyway. I repeated we did not want an empty <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0354"/>alliance. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> referred again to formal French undertaking in Article
                        V. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said we could interpret
                        French step as we wished. I said French move looked very much like a step in
                        direction of neutrality.</p>
                    <p>I spoke at some length about integration problem in NATO and pointed out
                        absence of integration in peacetime and consequently of any danger France
                        could be dragged into war against her will. I told <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> that I didn't think there was anybody
                        in the U.S. Government and probably in other allied governments who
                        seriously believed basis on which French action was presented, publicly,
                        pointing out that there was no integration in peacetime and consequently no
                        danger of France being dragged into a war through an integrated mechanism
                        that did not exist. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asserted
                        that France wanted to work out wartime accords and SHAPE and AFCENT
                        integrated headquarters are located on French soil.</p>
                    <p>I concluded the conversation by telling him that this was a very serious
                        action the French were undertaking and would have a very bad effect in the
                        U.S. I said we did not consider that the hard elements of the Soviet
                        situation had really changed in the last five years, that the Soviets
                        continued their military preparations, were still a dictatorship where
                        policy was made by a small group of men, were keeping Germany and Berlin
                        divided, and reminded him that less than five years ago we had been forced
                        to send troops to Europe to reinforce the Berlin position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> interrupted to say that we had
                        not found the French had backed down on Berlin. </p>
                    <p>On leaving I told <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> that I was
                        very saddened by this news, I had been one of the individuals involved in
                        the creation of NATO and I was particularly aware of the amount of effort
                        and devotion which had gone into the creation of the Atlantic defense
                        community which France was now leaving.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed to say to the press only that we had met and <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had given me a letter from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to President Johnson. There is to
                        be no discussion of contents.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> started the
                        meeting by denying vigorously that the Foreign Office had leaked it to Le
                        Monde, which leaves only the Elysee as a possible source.<note n="6" xml:id="d136fn6">In telegram 5562, March 7, <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>In three years our Atlantic Alliance will complete its first term. I am
                        anxious to tell you that France appreciates the extent to which the
                        solidarity of defense thus established between 15 free peoples of the West
                        contributes to assuring their security and, especially what essential role
                        the United States of America plays in this respect. Accordingly, France
                        intends from now on to remain party to the Treaty signed at Washington on
                        April 4, 1949. This means that except in the event of developments which
                        might occur in the course of the next three years to change the fundamental
                        factors of East-West relations, she will be in 1969 and thereafter
                        determined even as today to fight at the side of her allies in case one of
                        them will be the object of unprovoked aggression.</p>
                    <p>However, France considers the changes which have taken place or in process of
                        occurring since 1949 in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere, as well as evolution of
                        her own situation and her own forces no longer justify insofar as that
                        concerns her the arrangements of a military nature adopted after the
                        conclusion of the alliance, whether in common under the form of multilateral
                        conventions or whether by special agreement between the French Government
                        and the American Government.</p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that France proposes to recover the entire exercise of
                        her sovereignty over her territory, presently impaired by the permanent
                        presence of allied military elements or by constant utilization which is
                        made of her air space, to terminate her participation in “integrated”
                        commands and no longer to place her forces at the disposal of NATO. It goes
                        without saying that for the application of these decisions she is ready to
                        arrange with the governments and in particular with that of the United
                        States, practical measures which concern them. In addition, she is disposed
                        to have understandings with them as to military facilities to be mutually
                        accorded in the case of a conflict in which she would be engaged at their
                        sides and as to conditions of cooperation of her forces and theirs in the
                        event of common action, especially in Germany.</p>
                    <p>On all these points, Dear Mr. President, my Government will therefore be in
                        touch with yours. But in order to respond to the spirit of friendly candor
                        which must inspire the relations between our two countries and, permit me to
                        add between you and me, I have been desirous <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0356"/>firstly to indicate personally to you for what reasons, for
                        what purpose and within what limits France from her viewpoint believes the
                        form of our alliance should be modified without altering its basis.</p>
                    <p>I beg you to accept, Dear Mr. President, the assurances of my highest
                        consideration and the expression of my most cordial sentiments.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">On the evening of March 7, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> delivered to Lucet the following brief response
                            from the President:</note>

                        the NATO Alliance, I am asking for their comments.</p>
                    <p>“I would be less than frank if I did not inform you that your action raises

                    </list>
                    <p>A further response to DeGaulle will raise one central question on which your
                        advisers may disagree. The key to DeGaulle's letter is the distinction he
                        draws between (1) his obligation under the treaty to go to war in case of an
                        unprovoked attack on an ally and (2) the organizational and command
                        arrangements which are not strictly a part of the treaty but have grown up
                        since 1949. He says he will support (1): the treaty obligations, but is
                        against (2): the peacetime organizational arrangements.</p>
                    <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0357"/>
                    <p>Everyone is agreed that we must tell deGaulle that we and our other allies
                        are determined to preserve an integrated NATO structure with or without
                        France. The question is whether we should go further and tell him that if he
                        won't play his part in the organization, France will no longer enjoy the
                        protection of the treaty. This would flatly deny his basic distinction
                        between the organization and the treaty.</p>
                    <p>On its face, this is an appealing line:</p>
                    <p>—it satisfies one's sense of elementary justice: why should any nation profit
                        from the treaty without sharing in the work?</p>
                    <p>—it might convince sensible Frenchmen that the General has gone too far, and
                        is risking French security;</p>
                    <p>—it would provide a strong defense against critics at home who think it is
                        high time we stood up to DeGaulle.</p>
                    <p>But there is another side to the coin. It is a fact of geography that a U.S.
                        threat to deprive France of our protection is at best barely credible and at
                        worst, just plain silly. It is like threatening to abandon Kentucky in the
                        face of a land attack by Canada. It is hard to do unless one is prepared to
                        throw in Ohio. If we are going to defend the Germans against the Russians,
                        we cannot help but defend France too.</p>
                    <p>The alternative is not to appease DeGaulle. He is clearly not appeasable. And
                        there is no question that we must reaffirm our continuing commitment to an
                        integrated NATO, and to do what is necessary to make good on that
                        commitment—with an empty chair always waiting. <hi rend="italic">But we
                            could by-pass, for the time being, the question of the security
                            guarantee under the treaty, neither reaffirming it nor threatening to
                            withdraw it</hi>.</p>
                    <p>My guess would be that this second approach is more likely to gain us the
                        solid allied support we need. To the other Europeans, relations with France
                        are a sensitive political issue. In a confrontation, we will be in trouble
                        unless it is clear, not only that the provocation comes from Paris, but that
                        the U.S. is not over-reacting.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that a cool approach will draw some fire at home. We
                        will be accused of letting the French get away with murder, and still
                        promising to protect them. But even in terms of domestic politics, I think
                        it as likely as not that we will be safer than if we try to drum France out
                        of the treaty on terms that are legally questionable and militarily
                        meaningless. This would make us vulnerable to the more serious charge that
                        our inflexibility helped to destroy NATO.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, in the end, DeGaulle will behave so outrageously as to force us to
                        take a hard line even on the treaty. But for the time being, there is a
                        strong case for limiting our response to a positive reaffirmation of our
                        commitment to the organization, and not escalating the argument to the
                        question of treaty commitment. (Even under this option, we will be able to
                        take some very tough steps. For instance, I am inclined to think that we
                        should withdraw our nuclear support from the two French divisions in <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0358"/>Germany as soon as DeGaulle
                        actually withdraws these divisions from NATO command.)</p>
                    <p>Before making up your mind, you should hear both sides of the argument in
                        much greater detail. I am afraid that State's entirely natural irritation
                        with deGaulle predisposes them to take a very hard line. <hi rend="italic">If you wish to have the full range of choices spelled out, it will take
                            an instruction from here</hi>. You might wish to speak to the Secretary
                        of State yourself. Alternatively, Komer and I can let State know that you
                        want to be given a wide range of choices, especially on the question of the

                        reference for discussions to come rather than initiating those discussions.
                        Immediate focus must therefore be on tone and content President's reply
                        rather than premature implementation specific contingency plans.</p>

                        later develop.</p>
                    <p>3. Department believes that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting March
                        9 would make sham of Council if no cognizance were taken of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> letter. At same time, Dept

                        principal forum for future Alliance consultation on all aspects situation as
                        it emerges. (<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> letter
                        strongly suggests that France will remain at Council table.) Time, moreover,
                        prevents obtaining assurance that other Allies will be ready at March 9
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to espouse any sharply defined US
                        position.</p>
                    <p>4. In order meet objectives of Para 2 above, you are therefore instructed
                        consult with Roberts prior March 9 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>,
                        handing him text of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>-JOHNSON

                    <p>a. Roberts would open meeting by announcing he is informed that certain
                        members of Alliance have received communications from Government of France
                        of serious concern to entire Alliance. Roberts then would call upon you to
                        speak. You should make following statement:</p>
                    <p>“My Government has instructed me to inform the Council that it has received a
                        communication from a government signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty, the
                        Government of France. This communication raises serious questions for the
                        Alliance. My govt will wish to consult its Allies re the general views of
                        the French Govt as expressed in the communication and re the specific
                        concerns of the French Govt when they are made known, since the questions
                        raised are of vital interest to all of them.”</p>
                    <p>b. Roberts would then call upon any other <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s who are prepared to make statements. When such
                        statements have been made, Roberts would propose that Council move on to
                        formal agenda, including Vietnam briefing, thus preserving the appearance of
                        business as usual.<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4">At the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting on March 9, Cleveland made the

                        of Five at some point may attempt to use the European Communities as a
                        hostage in evolving NATO crisis and, realistically, positions taken in one
                        context will to some extent be related to other. We assume, however, that
                        the Five share our hope that the NATO crisis can be kept separate from the

                        implies that US not prepared meet NATO crisis squarely in security context,

                    <p>After I had read the memorandum, I very briefly repeated to Alphand what I
                        said to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">See <ref target="#d136">Document
                            136</ref>.</note> in regard to (1) absence of consultation for so
                        serious a step; General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        rather general vague remarks could not be regarded in this light,
                        particularly since not forthcoming in reply to questions. (2) That we did
                        not agree that the situation had changed in such a basic manner as the
                        French Government professed; Russia basically remained the same in its
                        political set up, ideologically, and in continuous military preparation;
                        Germany and Berlin remained divided, meaning that Berlin at anytime could
                        set off another crisis. (3) It was difficult for us to believe the basis on
                        which this action was taken since there was in effect no integration of
                        command in NATO; genuine integration of European armies had been refused by
                        French in 1954, and since there was no integration there could be no
                        subordination, and France had in effect without any attempted interference
                        from allies <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>pursued her own
                        military policy for a number of years. There really was no danger of France
                        or any other European country being drawn into a war in Asia through the
                        operation of NATO mechanism.</p>
                    <p>Alphand made briefly, and in a semi-halfhearted manner, standard replies. On
                        the first point he said we had known for some time that France was opposed
                        to integration, that this time had been selected in order to give plenty of
                        time before 1969 to work out the practicalities of the decision. He said we
                        might have different views in regard to Russia, but no one could deny that
                        the general world situation had changed since 1950, to which I replied that
                        the growth of Soviet nuclear power, which was more in their favor than in
                        ours, would seem to imply more cooperation rather than less.</p>
                    <p>I then asked <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> whether or not a
                        reply was expected to this memorandum, who was to take the initiative, where
                        and in what manner the discussions would be conducted. He said he could not
                        tell me that nor could he give me any indication as to the timing, but
                        obviously it will not be in the immediate future. In fact Alphand's replies
                        were so vague on this point that I had the very strong impression that the
                        French have really not thought through any of these questions.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                        that I had noticed in the French press there were continuing statements that
                        the U.S. had rejected French proposals to discuss Franco/American pacts on a
                        bilateral basis.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that this was not true, and referred <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> to my conversation with him on February 25 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5243);<note n="5" xml:id="d141fn5">Dated February 25.

                            letter<note n="6" xml:id="d141fn6">

                        specific negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> was
                        quick to “assure” me that this did not come from the Quai d'Orsay but felt
                        that impression had been received from manner in which the American press
                        treated the President's reply.<note n="7" xml:id="d141fn7">See <ref target="#d137fn2">footnote 2, Document 137</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I said that, as he knew, the President's reply did not make any reference to
                        form of negotiation one way or the other.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I find the memorandum very little more
                        explicit than the letter although it does state that Headquarters <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> when French withdraw will have to leave France, and it

                    <p rend="center">AIDE-MEMOIRE</p>
                    <p>For some years the Government of France has noted on numerous occasions,
                        publicly as well as in conversations with allied governments, that it
                        considered that the organization of the North Atlantic Treaty no longer
                        responded, as far as it is concerned, to the conditions which prevail in the
                        world at the present time and which are fundamentally different from those
                        of 1949 and the following years.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the threats weighing on the Western world, in particular in Europe,
                        and which had motivated the conclusion of the treaty have changed in nature.
                        They no longer present the immediate and menacing character that they
                        presented formerly. Further, the countries of Europe have reestablished
                        their economy and consequently have regained resources. In particular,
                        France is equipped with an atomic armament the very nature of which excludes
                        that it be integrated. In the third place, the nuclear equilibrium between
                        the Soviet Union and the United States being substituted for the monopoly
                        possessed by the latter, has transformed the general conditions of the
                        defense of the West. Finally, it is a fact that Europe is no longer the
                        center of international crisis. This (center) has moved elsewhere,
                        especially to Asia, where the ensemble of the countries of the Atlantic
                        Alliance is obviously not implicated.</p>
                    <p>This evolution does not in any manner lead the French Government to call into
                        question the treaty signed at Washington April 4, 1949. In other words and
                        except for events which, during the coming years, might come to modify in a
                        fundamental way relations between the East and the West, it does not intend
                        to avail itself in 1969 of the provisions of Article 13 of the treaty, and
                        considers that the alliance must continue as long as it appears
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>This being affirmed without equivocation, the problem of the organization is
                        posed, that is of all the agreements, arrangements and decisions taken after
                        the signature of the treaty, whether multilateral or bilateral in form. The
                        French Government considers that this organization no longer responds to
                        that which appears to it to be indispensable.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless one could conceive that a negotiation would be undertaken to modify
                        by common agreement the arrangements in force. The <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0364"/>French Government would have been happy to
                        propose it if it had had reason to think that it (the negotiation) could
                        lead to the result which it (the French Government) has in view. Everything
                        unhappily shows that such an undertaking would lead to failure, the partners
                        of France seeming to be, or declaring themselves, all in favor of the
                        maintenance of the status quo, if not of the reinforcement of everything
                        which, from the French point of view, appears henceforth unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, France is led to draw the consequences of the situation, that
                        is, to take for itself the measures which seem to it to be indispensable and
                        which are in no way incompatible with its participation in the alliance nor
                        with its participation, if such should be the case, in military operations
                        at the sides of its allies.</p>
                    <p>Already, in the past, the French Government has taken some measures of this
                        nature for its naval forces attached to NATO both in the Mediterranean and
                        in the Atlantic. It is now a question of its land and air forces stationed
                        in Germany and which are assigned to the allied command in Europe. France
                        proposes to put an end to such assignment. This decision will lead to its
                        simultaneous withdrawal from the two integrated commands its forces are
                        attached to, and in which it participates in the framework of NATO, that is,
                        the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and the Central European Command,
                        and, for the same reason, the transfer, outside of French territory, of the
                        seats of these two headquarters.</p>
                    <p>The application of the ensemble of these measures obviously raises numerous
                        problems, which the Government of France is ready as of now to discuss with
                        its allies and in particular with the United States of America. There will
                        be reason to examine the liaison which would be established between the
                        French command and NATO command, as well as to determine the conditions in
                        which the French forces, particularly in Germany, would participate in time
                        of war, if Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington was called into play, in
                        military actions in common, both with respect to the command as well as with
                        respect to the operations themselves. This supposes in particular that the
                        French land and air forces presently stationed in Germany will be maintained
                        there under the conventions of 23 October 1954, which the Government of
                        France is for its part disposed to do. Further, there will be reason to
                        consider the problems which might be posed for France with respect to the
                        Military Committee and the Standing Group, including the liaison to be
                        established, if necessary, between these organisms and the French
                        command.</p>
                    <p>Such are, in broad outline, the actions the Government of France envisages,
                        as far as it is concerned, in order to adapt the modalities of its
                        participation in the Atlantic Alliance to the new conditions. It is ready to
                        engage in discussions on the practical conditions for the application of
                        these measures and hopes that adequate arrangements can be brought about by
                        common agreement among all of the allies.</p>
                    <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"/>
                    <p>The multilateral problems are not however the only ones posed for the United
                        States and France. The two countries have indeed concluded in the past a
                        series of bilateral accords still in force, which are the following:</p>
                    <p>Depots of Deols-La Martineries</p>
                    <p>The placing at the disposition of American forces of certain airfields and
                        installations in France</p>
                    <p>Line of Communications</p>
                    <p>American Headquarters at St. Germain</p>
                    <p>Pipeline.</p>
                    <p>The Government of France considers that these accords in their entirety no

                        conflict in which one or the other countries would participate by virtue of
                        the Atlantic Alliance. These facilities could be made the object of an
                        agreement to be concluded between the two governments.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">On March 25, the United States transmitted a 3-page

                    <p>For example, a cardinal issue in the draft thrust before you this
                            morning<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">No record of the meeting with the
                            President at 11:05 a.m. on March 16 has been found. An agenda for it
                            notes that there would be a report on the diplomatic situation and a
                            discussion of the following five issues: 1) relocation of military
                            facilities, 2) French forces in Germany, 3) U.S. nuclear support for
                            French forces in Germany, 4) France and the treaty, and 5) the general
                            U.S. attitude toward France. (Ibid.) Although the draft under reference
                            has not been found, it was probably a draft of <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> is not just its tone but what certain
                        key phrases in it imply. We all have the natural impulse to get back at
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, and to explain to the
                        French people why he is wrong. But the draft goes much further when it says
                        that we not only intend to continue our past NATO policies “but to urge
                        extension of these principles of common and joint preparation wherever they
                        can be usefully applied” (p. 5), and that you dedicate us not just to
                        preservation of NATO but “to the creative task of strengthening it …” (p.
                        6).</p>
                    <p>This is not just rhetoric. As Dean <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> told you, his group feels that we must seek <hi rend="italic">to strengthen NATO by something new</hi>, so that we don't
                        end up with “the same old NATO slightly weaker” (without France).<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3"> Dean Acheson headed a U.S. interdepartmental group
                            that reported to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and was
                            tasked with drafting a reply to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                        best way to stop <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is to beef
                        up the alliance—make it more integrated rather than less.</p>
                    <p>This is great stuff if we can do it. But will it work?</p>
                    <p>Before we announce that we're going to the precise opposite direction from
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, let's first look at
                        “how.” To my knowledge, <hi rend="italic">the only “new” idea we have for
                            strengthening the alliance is the well-known <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        </hi> (or the UK variant—<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>). Query—is this
                        proposed new strengthening of NATO simply an opening for a new push on
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> has
                        many advantages—you've heard the arguments. Moreover, the NATO country most
                        spooked by Gaullists wrecking will be West Germany. What better way to
                        reassure Bonn than to give it a finger on the nuclear trigger, or at least a
                        greater sense of nuclear participation? Bonn itself is already talking up
                        this line.</p>
                    <p>But there may also be real disadvantages which need full airing before we
                        jump. That France's withdrawal from the NATO structure inevitably enhances
                        Germany's role will worry many allies—Scandinavians, Italians, Benelux, UK.
                        They may not be so eager to see a US/UK/German combination, without the
                        continental counterbalance of the French.</p>
                    <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0367"/>
                    <p>Second, what we all fear now is new French initiatives toward the USSR. There
                        are few issues in which Paris and Moscow might see a greater common
                        interest—or one more popular in Europe—than in opposing a nuclear role for
                        Bonn. So taking this road toward strengthening NATO may help bring about
                        precisely what we want to avoid.</p>
                    <p>Third, and not least, does a political crisis in Europe help or hurt us at
                        home? Exerting firm leadership of the Western Alliance is one thing, but
                        what if all it leads to is a great ruckus with little concrete result? We
                        already have one war in Asia, and I can see the Europe-firsters clamoring
                        that <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> is leading us
                        into trouble on both flanks. Don't we also risk Republican charges that
                        we're losing two wars instead of one?</p>
                    <p>Finally, <hi rend="italic">can we win a war with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> just now over more integration vs. less?</hi>
                        I doubt it. He's just been elected for seven more years and nobody believes
                        we can get him to reverse course—whether what he's doing is popular in
                        France or not. Even to try may risk splitting NATO further by giving play to
                        all the latent centrifugal tendencies in Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Turkey
                        and Greece. Can we afford to have yet others play the same game as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the lessons of recent history all suggest that we stop, look, and
                        listen before flinging down the gauntlet to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. He may well be right in thinking he has us in a spot
                        where we can't react vigorously—let's not underestimate him. Isn't he dead
                        right in appreciating that the threat of Soviet aggression is less and that
                        he can thus get away with more? He also has a receptive European audience
                        for his mischievous contention that we might drag NATO into a larger war
                        emerging from Vietnam. Nor should the basic merit of our own grand design
                        for European integration blind us to the likelihood that moving it further
                        forward may be an uphill fight till Britain decides to enter Europe or
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> passes from the
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>So before answering State's clarion call to propaganda battle, you deserve to
                        be convinced that it's one we can reasonably expect to win. If not, it may
                        be wiser to outwait <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>—while
                        limiting the damage he can do. This alternative calls for a firm defensive
                        stance whereby the rest of NATO proceeds with business as usual, while
                        reserving an “empty chair” till France outlives De Gaulle. To thus prevent
                        NATO from slipping backward may be the best that we can hope for just now.
                        The real problem, as always, is not France but Germany—and the more we
                        agitate the alliance the more we may bring this potentially divisive issue
                        to the fore.</p>
                    <p>This memo deliberately accentuates the negative, and my worries may be
                        overdrawn. But our staff job is to give you both sides of any story—and to
                        show the options if others don't. In any case I see no reason for
                        precipitate action on a letter or a statement; this matter could well <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0368"/>stand mulling over for a week or

                        that the French may attempt to revive in one form or another Fouchet-like
                        proposals for political consultation among Six. The French could suggest
                        this as a means of dealing on European basis with the current NATO crisis.

                        initiatives among the Six.</p>
                    <p>In the current situation any step in this direction seems to us contrary to
                        the real interests of the Five and of the United States. Our prime objective
                        is to maintain the unity of the fourteen in the face of the French assault
                        and to try to limit spillover to the European Communities as indicated

                        discussions among the Six regarding political matters and particularly NATO
                        could be used by the French as evidence of disunity among the fourteen and
                        would encourage centrifugal forces already at work on several of the other
                        members of NATO. It might also hasten moment of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> involvement with adverse implications from US point of
                        view.</p>

                    <p>Sir Patrick said that Dean Acheson, at lunch on March 16, had mentioned his
                        ideas about what should be done about the NATO-France situation, emphasizing
                        that these were purely personal.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">A summary of

                            March 17. (Ibid.)</note> The Ambassador said he knew that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> was now advising the Department and
                            <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0370"/>would be interested in knowing
                        to what extent the U.S. views parallel Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>'s. By way of prelude, he emphasized that the UK was
                        still anxious to get the work of a 14-nation planning group under way in
                        Paris, especially now that the French seem to be acquiescent about letting
                        the fourteen, so long as they were not formally organized, use International
                        Staff services.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> was
                        working closely with the Department and he was familiar with his ideas. He,
                        himself, thought that the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> could usefully
                        carry on some work. Particularly the fourteen might: (a) do contingency
                        thinking about French agreements with NATO itself; (b) consider if both
                            <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and NATO Headquarters should
                        move and where, and, if so; (c) consider how to reduce the present NATO
                        staff to make it more efficient (Sir Patrick interjected that the UK would
                        certainly agree with that); and, (d) consult together on replies to the
                        French aide-memoire.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">
                            <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that the U.S. is
                        thinking along the lines of a very simple reply which would acknowledge the
                        receipt of the aide-memoire, take the position that we do not interpret it
                        as representing decisive action, and note that we are awaiting further
                        clarification from France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>
                        thought we should seek to coordinate texts among the fourteen but not spend
                        time trying to work out identical texts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the work which the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> might do at this stage was less important than the hard
                        studies which the major powers should undertake at once. The U.S., UK,
                        Germany and Italy should study the major issues, should exchange views with
                        one another, and then they would be in a position to provide leadership to
                        the remaining members of the fourteen.</p>
                    <p>He thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>'s comment was
                        very much to the point that we are in fact losing France from the Alliance
                        and must, therefore, search for ways to make the Alliance stronger. Among
                        the areas of opportunity which open up, the first, he emphasized, is nuclear
                        sharing. If <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> comes forward
                        with a nuclear guarantee for the European Allies, we should be in a position
                        to move promptly to a nuclear sharing agreement to demonstrate a stronger
                        Alliance. Some of the other areas which we need to study closely are: (a)
                        Foreign exchange. We need to look at the offset problem against the general
                        proposition that defense arrangements should not create unfair burdens. (b)
                        Location of NATO Headquarters. (c) Attitude toward German reunification. In
                        that connection, he called attention to the March 17 report from Paris that
                        Zorin <note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4"> Valerian A. Zorin, Soviet Ambassador to
                            France.</note> had said the Soviets are interested in a non-aggression
                        treaty with the French and a reciprocal relaxation between NATO and the
                        Warsaw Pact could follow. <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0371"/>This
                        raised a question, he said, whether it was likely that Zorin would make such
                        far-reaching remarks if there had been no prior contacts between France and
                        the Soviets. (d) Status of the Standing Group and Military Committee. While
                        looking at these, perhaps it was time to look into the idea of a Defense
                        Minister or perhaps a Political Minister for NATO. (e) What about the
                        practice of unanimity in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>? How could NATO
                        procedures be arranged to avoid a French veto? The Secretary said that we
                        would be studying these and other questions of substance and hoped that all
                        the major Allies would consider these matters so that together they could
                        move them forward within the Alliance as a whole.</p>
                    <p> Sir Patrick said that London would be thinking hard about such questions and
                        there was, he thought, general agreement about the need to approach the
                        major problems in this manner. But, of course, the UK would want the
                        fourteen to carry on their own work during the coming weeks. He recognized
                        that the nuclear subject was touchy business. He did not disagree when the
                        Secretary commented that Chalfont <note n="5" xml:id="d145fn5"> Lord
                            Chalfont, British Minister of Disarmament.</note> was probably right in
                        his thinking that the West ought to act on the NATO nuclear problem and get
                        it out of the way and then we might be in a position to make progress with
                        the Soviets on non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p> Sir Patrick asked how the U.S. thought we should organize the necessary
                        high-level consultation between the major Allies and asked if we had in mind
                        ad hoc meetings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that
                        we were thinking of continuing to operate on a bilateral basis with
                        exchanges of papers. In the meantime, when he met with the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on Vietnam on March 29, he would discuss
                        further with <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> the kind of
                        work which the fourteen could properly carry forward. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> cautioned that as we go on, we must
                        take care to disabuse the press that a triumvirate or quadrumvirate is
                        developing. In that connection, he wondered whether the Ministers would
                        tackle the major issues at the June Ministerial Meeting or maybe earlier.
                        The Secretary thought some issues might not wait until June, but, at the
                        same time, he did not favor having a meeting of Ministers before June.</p>
                    <p>In the course of a few remarks on the coming election, Sir Patrick said that
                        the Government would firmly support NATO along the lines of the proposed
                        declaration. The Secretary said he hoped that they would tone down
                        criticisms of the Germans.</p>
                    <p>(The Secretary had to leave at this point.) Sir Patrick told the Under
                        Secretary that if the British were to talk about the NATO nuclear problem,
                        they would certainly want to talk about the offset problem at the same time.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that one could be
                        helpful to the other and he thought it useful to examine them together in a
                        larger context.</p>
                    <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0372"/>
                    <p>Mr. Bendall said there was a fundamental policy decision on which the major
                        powers needed to agree—what is to be the basic premise towards France—a hard
                        exclusive policy or one which looked for ways to facilitate the maximum
                        French association with NATO? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we should try to avoid French bilateral
                        arrangements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> commented
                        that the critical problem is the French forces in Germany. Of course, there
                        are other considerations. He mentioned <gloss target="#t_NADGE1">NADGE</gloss>, and Sir Patrick added there would be the basic matter of
                        security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded that it
                        would create a significant political disadvantage for us all if the French
                        stayed in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on a special basis; we are
                        looking especially carefully at this question.</p>
                    <p> Sir Patrick said London would study these and other problems in the coming
                        days and he hoped that the U.S. and UK would be in a position to exchange
                        ideas and notes before long.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>On March 7 you wrote to inform me of the general course of action your
                        Government proposes to follow with regard to the North Atlantic Treaty and
                        the organization and arrangements which have been set up to serve its
                            purposes.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">
                            <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note> The course you propose
                        will so seriously affect the security and well-being of citizens of all the
                        allied states that I felt it imperative to seek the counsel of the other
                        Treaty members before replying in detail. I should like now to set forth
                        what seem to me the fundamentals of this matter.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin with the American conception of the purpose of the North
                        Atlantic Treaty and the Alliance it creates. Under our Constitution, that
                        Treaty is the law of the land. Like our Constitution, it is more than a
                        legal document. It is the outward and visible form of a living
                        institution—not an alliance to make war, but an alliance to keep the peace.
                        For nearly two decades this alliance has assured the peace and security of
                        the <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0373"/>North Atlantic area. It has
                        greatly reinforced stability throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>The Alliance, in our view, reflects two important propositions. The first is
                        that if war should come to the Atlantic area, we must fight together—and
                        fight effectively. The second is that if we act together for the common
                        interest during peace, war will not come. The organization designed to carry
                        out both these propositions, NATO, became in fact an Organization for Peace.
                        To that Organization, which grew significantly out of France's own needs and
                        urgings, France and many distinguished Frenchmen have made an inestimable
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>The Organization combined the contributions of the member nations into a
                        common instrument for deterring war by preparing together to meet aggression
                        if aggression should occur. I have no doubt that deterrence resulted not
                        only from the military coherence achieved but also from the political unity
                        of purpose it exemplified. If the dissolution of the former casts in doubt
                        the latter, as it inevitably will, I fear that those who draw hope from
                        Western disunity will be much encouraged.</p>
                    <p>As you say, conditions have changed since 1949. They have greatly changed for
                        the better, due significantly in my opinion to our combined efforts under
                        the Treaty. But should our collective effort falter and erode the common
                        determination which it reflects, the foundation of the present stability
                        would be undermined.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you restated the firm commitment of France to fight beside her
                        allies if any member of NATO should suffer unprovoked aggression. I respect
                        that pledge. But we believe more is needed to achieve effective deterrence
                        and to maintain peace in the North Atlantic area.</p>
                    <p>I am puzzled by your view that the presence of allied military forces on
                        French soil impairs the sovereignty of France. Those forces have been there
                        at French invitation pursuant to a common plan to help insure the security
                        of France and her allies. I have always viewed their presence as a wise and
                        far-seeing exercise of French sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>For our part, we continue to believe that if the Treaty is to have force and
                        reality, members of the Alliance should prepare the command structures, the
                        strategic and tactical plans, the forces in being, and their designation to
                        NATO in advance of any crisis and for use in time of crisis. NATO
                        arrangements should reflect the technological and strategic imperatives of
                        our age. Readiness to fight instantly under agreed plans and procedures,
                        worked out and practiced in peacetime, adds immeasurably to our common
                        strength. We will continue our past policy of full participation and
                        cooperation in NATO. We believe the member nations, working within the
                        Alliance with one another, should adapt to whatever organizational
                        arrangements the needs of the hour may require.</p>
                    <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0374"/>
                    <p>I do not consider that such participation and cooperation involves any
                        impairment of our own sovereignty—or that of any of our allies. In my
                        judgment it reflects the exercise of sovereignty according to the highest
                        traditions of responsible self-interest.</p>
                    <p>The North Atlantic Treaty commits its signatories to assist any member
                        subjected to armed attack within the areas specified. Governments, of
                        course, must fulfill their commitments in accordance with their own
                        constitutional procedures. But commitments should be honored as effectively
                        as peacetime preparation can assure. It seems to me essential, therefore,
                        that all members of the Alliance be prepared to act in any emergency through
                        their mutual organization and in accordance with mutual plans. Reliance in
                        crisis on independent action by separate forces in accordance with national
                        plans, only loosely coordinated with joint forces and plans, seems to me
                        dangerous for all concerned. It has proved disastrous in the past.</p>
                    <p>The other fourteen member nations of NATO do not take the same view of their
                        interests as that taken at this moment by the Government of France. The
                        United States is determined to join with them in preserving the deterrent
                        system of NATO—indeed, in strengthening it in support of the vital common
                        purposes of the West. We do not intend to ignore the experience of the past
                        twenty years.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, we find it difficult to believe that France, which has made a unique
                        contribution to Western security and development, will long remain withdrawn
                        from the common affairs and responsibilities of the Atlantic. As our old
                        friend and ally her place will await France whenever she decides to resume
                        her leading role.</p>

                    <p>6118. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subject: NATO and France.</p>
                    <p>1. PermRep lunch today featured an adversary proceeding between de Leusse and
                        everyone else present (US, UK, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, Italy,
                        Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Brosio).</p>
                    <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0375"/>
                    <p>2. It started when <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> why French newspapers
                        were reporting French Government expects substantive replies from the
                        fourteen recipients of French aide-memoire. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De
                            Leusse</persName> said French on their side were baffled by absence of
                        response, expecting at least some of their allies would want to ask
                        questions about the stated French intentions.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and PermReps of UK, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, Italy, Belgium and U.S. all asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> in various ways why he
                        expected to receive in reply to French note anything but a polite
                        acknowledgment and a reiteration of the principles already published in
                        fourteen-nation declaration. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De
                            Leusse</persName> kept repeating French assumption that allies would
                        express their curiosity about “modalities” of carrying out French
                        “decisions.” French would then satisfy curiosity by indicating timing and
                        other conditions for French withdrawal from NATO and NATO withdrawal from
                        France.</p>
                    <p>4. We asked <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> repeatedly what
                        question he would suggest we ask, that he would be in a position to answer.
                        He conceded that any question we asked (for example in tomorrow's <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting) would have to be answered by
                        saying he did not know the answer.</p>
                    <p>5. We told <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> it was reasonable
                        to expect allies to reply to the note but fanciful to expect them to ask
                        substantive questions in reply.</p>
                    <p>6. This theme—that French were entitled to a reply but not to an answer—was
                        picked up by most of the others. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De
                            Leusse</persName> said in absence of replies to French note, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would probably start
                        ordering actions to be taken.</p>
                    <p>7. This led to a frank discussion of the various avenues of action open to
                        the French. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, with interjections
                        from others, produced the following categories:</p>
                    <p>(A) Withdrawal of French officers and other military personnel from
                        “integrated commands.” There was general agreement that French could and
                        probably would do this first, since it requires no real consultation with
                        anybody. However, de Leusse made sharp distinction between “Generals” and
                        “telephonistes,” saying that French purpose was not to paralyze NATO
                        activity and implying French may leave some service personnel, particularly
                        in the communications field.</p>
                    <p>(B) Withdrawal of commitment of French ground troops and air squadrons to
                        NATO. This was an action French can take without consulting anybody.
                        However, it clearly would require countervailing action on the part of other
                        governments (for example, US decision about nuclear weapons available for
                        French troops, and decision by Germany and other allies about whether France
                        has the right to station forces in Germany if they are not committed to
                        NATO).</p>
                    <p>(C) Eviction of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> from French soil. Here French
                        Government is no longer giving orders to Frenchmen but to officers and
                        officials of other governments. Unless France has in mind physically <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0376"/>ejecting <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> staffs
                        (“You really can't treat us as if we were Formosa's <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> delegation,” said <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>), this action will require some
                        negotiations about dates, ultimate size, cost-sharing, and the like.</p>
                    <p>(D) Bilateral evictions, notably of U.S. and Canadian installations. Here,
                        too, France has to negotiate with other nations unless it is prepared to use
                        its gendarmerie.</p>
                    <p>8. In discussing these categories, particularly (C) and (D), other PermReps
                        including <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> kept emphasizing
                        the narrow limits within which French Government could unilaterally make
                        decisions that would be binding on its allies. Essentially the line drawn in
                        the discussion was between actions in which the French Government is
                        ordering Frenchmen around, and actions in which the French Government
                        proposes to affect the lives, functions, or locations of non-French
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>9. Woven into this long dialogue were frequent references to financial
                        implications of prospective French moves. At one point <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said, and <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> in effect agreed, that French
                        Government could not make “decisions” to increase the amount of money
                        budgeted and appropriated by allied governments for NATO and European
                        defense purposes. Decisions on sharing costs of French moves must obviously
                        be negotiated and agreed to by Ministries of Finance of all allied
                        governments, unless France “decision” had attached to it a check for the
                        full additive cost it would entail. Other PermReps chimed in with some
                        alacrity on the same theme.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> (Belgium) raised some
                        even more fundamental questions, which were not thoroughly discussed. He
                        said essential issue was degree to which other allies need feel obliged to
                        worry about the defense of France, in view of the French declaration of
                        intentions. There would be Belgians, he said, who would advocate Belgian
                        neutrality under these circumstances; the larger nations in NATO would have
                        to act with a certain sense of responsibility, but perhaps the smaller
                        nations could show what nuisance value they still retained in relation to
                        France. He raised particularly the question whether the NATO air defense
                        system, which provides early warning information to French defenses,
                        including the force de frappe, should perhaps be withheld from France unless
                        reasonable attitude was shown on such issues as use of French air space.</p>
                    <p>11. Dialogue on this subject was not fully engaged, which was just as well
                        since <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> was overstating
                        his case in the heat of discussion.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> will probably report to
                        Quai that French can expect replies but no real answers to French
                        aide-memoire. All PermReps present seemed to be clear that it did not make
                        sense for allies to do <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0377"/>anything but
                        acknowledge French note at the same level of generality in which it is
                        written, and await further “precisions” from the French side.</p>
                    <p>Several of his colleagues were very frank in telling <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> could not escape taking the initiative in making
                        detailed proposal to open the negotiations on specific issues.</p>

                    <p> Schumann. The question at issue regarding NATO is not the alliance itself
                        but only the form of the alliance. France will remain in the alliance.</p>
                    <p>The President hoped that nothing would be done to weaken the alliance. The
                        basic views which the US held regarding NATO at the time of its formation
                        still prevail and most of the other members agree. He regretted the stand
                        which France is taking on NATO and hopes that French views will change. The
                        French position will make the road more difficult for the US which is trying
                        to help all over the world. Our governments do not always see matters alike
                        and this is only natural, but he wished that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> did not feel the way he does
                        about working within the alliance. Apparently the General has charted his
                        course. For its part the US is determined to remain steadfast in pursuit of
                        NATO objectives. There will be need for reforming, re-grouping and
                        re-evaluating. We hope that this can be done with a minimum of inconvenience
                        and <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0378"/>discomfort. The President said
                        he always turns his cheek and never hits back. He did not feel that the US
                        was in any way violating French sovereignty and if the French felt that we
                        had, we would simply have to accept that this is their view.</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that the French never claimed that the US was violating French
                        sovereignty. The French only want a new structure of the alliance, which
                        would restore French sovereignty. There is no intention to weaken the
                        alliance or to forget the common goal. He thought that France would become
                        an even more efficient partner not only as illustrated by French support in
                        the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, but also by helping the West, especially the
                        US, in reaching a better understanding with the East. No new alliance is
                        envisaged. France might well be useful, for example, in achieving a solution
                        of the German problem. In Schumann's view there should be no loosening of
                        the military alliance itself. He said that if cooperation is not extended to
                        the nuclear field, it would not be effective. But there should be no
                        loosening of military ties. In time this intention of the French would
                        become clear.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the letter which he had just sent to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and which Schumann had
                            read.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">
                            <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> The President said that
                        if it was simply a question of improving the NATO organization, that would
                        be all right. But the French appear determined to go it alone and that would
                        simply create more problems. The other 14 should see to it that NATO remains
                        intact, if possible get even closer together and keep people from feeding on
                        dissension.</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that collective action was one thing but integration was
                        another.</p>
                    <p>(There was a brief discussion of a possible meeting of NATO parliamentarians
                        in Paris in the Fall.)</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that the basic French commitment was covered in the NATO
                        Treaty; and then made a vague observation to the fact that a good deal of
                        cooperation was needed outside the NATO area.</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that he looked forward to a Franco-American summit meeting and
                        invited the President to come to Paris.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that when <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was here for the Kennedy funeral he thought there
                        would be an opportunity for the General to return to the United States some
                        time later for talks but that he understood that the General did not feel
                        able to do this for a reason which he never fully understood.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to point out that the French action would inevitably
                        have a distressing effect on the American people. We were very close to the
                        French whom we regarded as our friends, and anything <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0379"/>like the current development of France's
                        pulling away from us and the other allies would certainly have repercussions
                        in the United States. The President said that he personally would not add
                        gasoline to the fire.</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that France was not adopting a course away from the US. But
                        there is now a new France built on a new economic foundation of financial
                        stability. The French appreciated America's help during the war and through
                        the Marshall Plan and through its initiative in creating NATO. But now
                        France was more special and more important than it used to be.</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed the importance of our friends, but this was no reason
                        for going it alone. We can still be important and act collectively.</p>
                    <p> Schumann, quoting the Animal Farm, observed that some are more equal than
                        others.</p>
                    <p>The President said that what has made us important is our standing
                        together.</p>
                    <p> Schumann replied that France would not leave its friends.</p>
                    <p>The President then pointed to the last sentence in his letter to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and asked Schumann to
                        remember it: “As our old friend and ally her place will await France
                        whenever she decides to resume her leading role.”</p>
                    <p> Schumann said the President should not feel that there is any chance that
                        French policy will change. It is “irretrievable.” Mitterand, the only
                        possible opposition leader to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, had in effect criticized the General for not going
                        further by advocating the elimination of both the NATO alliance and the
                        Warsaw Pact. He said that everybody in France feels that the time has come
                        for a reappraisal of the alliance, even though everybody in France supports
                        the alliance.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it is one thing to readjust, to adapt, to perfect, in
                        order to meet conditions; but it was another to take a different road alone.
                        The President said he has known how <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> felt on certain organizational matters and such
                        questions might be arranged. But there was no need to say the US was
                        violating France's sovereignty and must get out. This development could blow
                        up the whole arrangement. He hoped that it will not. He hoped that France
                        would come back. For the moment things will be very difficult. He watched
                        this development taking place not in anger, but in sorrow. He hoped that
                        nothing that he had done personally had contributed to it. It was a fait
                        accompli before he came on the scene. The President said that he assumed
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> speaks for the French
                        people. He regretted the French action, but was helpless to do anything
                        about it except to unite the 14.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0380"/> Schumann then referred to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s memorandum to
                        Washington and London in 1958 regarding a NATO Directorate of three.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">See <ref target="frus1958-60v07p2">Foreign
                                Relations, 1958–1960, vol. VII</ref>, Part 2, pp. 82–83.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President said he recalled that. Certainly organizational improvements
                        could be made in NATO to help in overcoming General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s distaste for present
                        arrangements but drastic actions are not called for.</p>
                    <p> Schumann said that since France would remain in the alliance even after 1969
                        some adjustment would be inevitable.</p>
                    <p>The President said that whatever course France may take, and however
                        distressing this course may be, he was convinced that the French people
                        would be there when the chips were down. Schumann agreed. But, the President
                        added, we shouldn't have to suffer meanwhile. We ought to be able to get
                        along in prosperity as well as in crisis. He asked Schumann to convey to his
                        colleagues the high regard and affection of America for the people of
                        France. He thanked General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        for sending us Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName>
                        although we were, of course, sorry to see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> leave us. He thought that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had been good for
                        France and the Free World even though we disagree with what he is doing.</p>

                    <p>6415. Now that the full French program on NATO (with certain ambiguities in
                        regard to the French troops in Germany) and on American bases has been fully
                        exposed, I believe a certain number of conclusions in regard to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s policies and actions in this
                        field might be worthwhile, in particular for those who might be briefing for
                        background press or other sources of public media. I would not recommend
                        that any of this be used for attributable briefing:</p>
                    <p>1. It is perfectly apparent that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> never had any intention of engaging in any
                        negotiations with the US or his allies for a “reform” of the NATO
                        organization. A check of the record shows that American officials, from
                        President Kennedy (to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName>), to the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and myself, all had on a number of occasions asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> exactly what he wished
                        to do in regard to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Practically on
                        every occasion he said it was too soon to be discussed, but that we would be
                        informed (sic) in good time. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> obviously was engaged in deliberate utilization of
                        “Ruse” (one of his favorite gambits in international affairs).</p>
                    <p>Therefore, there is not the slightest validity to the statements of Lippmann,
                        for example, or any other correspondent to the effect that if differently
                        handled we might have produced certain modifications of the organization
                        which would have kept France in. What <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> wanted, and finally achieved, was his total withdrawal
                        from all multilateral aspects of NATO organization while attempting to
                        create the illusion for French and European opinion that he is faithful to
                        the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>2. The questions as to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        motivations as to timing are still subjects of discussion in Paris. I have
                        yet to find a Frenchman, even a Gaullist, who can give you a satisfactory
                        explanation why <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, contrary
                        to the general essence of his press conference of February 21, chose to
                        precipitate matters and above all to treat matters of NATO and US bases at
                        the same time and in the same communication. The best guess is as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wished to have the matter
                        settled from the point of view of decision well before the probable date of
                        elections in February/March 1967. He probably recognized that the
                        continuance of the Gaullist majority in the Assembly was not certain and may
                        have felt that a rebuff in <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0382"/>these
                        elections might make it very much more difficult for him to do what he
                        wished to do in regard to NATO and the American bases. In any event, he most
                        certainly wished to have the matter disposed of and no longer an issue by
                        the time the electoral period came around. It is probable that his change of
                        tactics, which led him to accelerate the process, was due to his sudden
                        realization that had this been announced after his visit to Moscow he would
                        have been open to the charge, and many French would have believed it, that
                        he made a deal at the expense of his allies with the Soviets. In <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s eyes it is one thing to betray
                        the Alliance under his own steam but another to do it in collusion with an
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>3. This has been virtually one hundred percent <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s own idea. From the scattered bits of information we
                        have obtained in regard to the handling of this it is apparent that the Quai
                        d'Orsay, and to some extent the Defense Nationale, disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s timing and handling of the
                        matter. It is doubtful if without <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> there would have been any such move in French
                        Government to pull out of NATO so completely as he has done. It is an
                        interesting sidelight on the future of affairs in Gaullist France, where one
                        man can literally dominate not only the policy itself but its execution in
                        the most minute terms without any serious reference to any other body or
                        Parliament. In this connection, it might be mentioned, however, that under
                        French law the denunciation of these agreements and their termination do not
                        require assembly approval.</p>
                    <p>4. There is absolutely no chance of changing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s mind or modifying his ideas. The only possibility
                        would be to bring about a set of conditions in the Alliance which might
                        affect his future operation of policy.</p>
                    <p>5. In effect, we (and the other members of the Alliance as well as other
                        nations of the Western world) have a confrontation between two diametrically
                        opposed ideas concerning the conduct of foreign relations in the modern
                        world. On one hand <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                        fanatically a proponent of the idea of independence; that the nation-state
                        is the sole enduring, viable entity in international relations; that this
                        entity is uncompromisable and multilateral arrangements tend to limit its
                        freedom and independence. On the other hand is the concept espoused by the
                        US and other states in the modern world which considers all nations, even
                        the most powerful, as inter-dependent in their relations with other like
                        minded, particularly allied, states. It is not necessary to pursue the two
                        different lines in too great detail since the consequences are obvious. It
                        is only that the recent actions against NATO, while not the only ones, are
                        the most open and manifest expressions of de Gaulle's idea on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>6. It is obvious that there is not much that we can do except to endeavor to
                        keep the Alliance together to make the necessary physical <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0383"/>transfers, and to do this with calm and
                        avoidance of over dramatizing the issue, which would be greatly to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s liking. There is also the very
                        important question of the reaction of French public opinion, which at the
                        moment is still confused and not too clear as to the issue involved and the
                        gravity of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actions. It
                        would seem to me, and this is the view at least of a number of experienced
                        diplomats in Paris, that there are three points in this procedure which
                        concern, or will concern, French public opinion, they are: (1) the isolation
                        of France in the diplomatic and military sense, (2) the increased weight of
                        Germany in military matters, and (3) the effect on the future of Europe, and
                        particularly the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me in conclusion that it is extremely important that we should be
                        very careful to avoid giving the Gaullists any reason, which they are
                        obviously now looking for, to state that the US is attempting to intervene
                        in French domestic affairs, particularly in connection with the forthcoming
                        parliamentary elections. Therefore, any moves that we make, for example to
                        increase the information program as recommended from here, should be done
                        very discreetly and no action, except those of the government in connection
                        specifically with NATO and bases, should be carried out in such a way as to
                        emphasize the importance of France.</p>

                    <p>It was agreed that the North Atlantic Council should move from Paris and that
                        the NATO military headquarters should be co-located with the Council.</p>
                    <p>It was <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi> that the Defense Department should
                        assume the responsibility for preparing promptly a total plan embracing:</p>
                    <p>(a) Relocation of all NATO and US bilateral elements in France, taking
                        account of the need for co-locating the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        and the military headquarters;</p>
                    <p>(b) The reorganization of the command structure, having in view the creation
                        of a “Supremo” with command and planning functions over all NATO elements,
                        in lieu of the present separate commands of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss>, etc;
                        and</p>
                    <p>(c) Assurance of civilian control (via <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. French Troops in Germany</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that:</p>
                    <p>(a) If Germany is prepared to insist that French troops may remain in Germany
                        only under existing arrangements and will have to withdraw if the French
                        proceed to decommit these forces from NATO, the US should fully support the
                        Germans and do nothing to dissuade them:</p>
                    <p>(b) If, on the other hand, the Germans wish to find some new arrangement
                        which would permit the continuance of French forces in Germany, the US
                        should urge them to incorporate in these new arrangements effective
                        safeguards assuring their use in accordance with NATO requirements and an
                        adequate quid pro quo giving to the other allies in Germany facilities in
                        France such as transit and overflight rights.</p>
                    <p>State was assigned the task of preparing a position paper along the foregoing
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>(c) It was agreed to explore the possibility of initiating US-UK-German
                        discussions on this problem at the Foreign Ministers' level, possibly in
                        Washington, at an early date. Alternatively, a special US representative
                        might be sent to Bonn for the purpose.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">The

                            and then authorize the Secretary of State to meet his British and German
                            counterparts to insist on an agreement. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>'s views were approved, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed to pursue the matter with

                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and NATO crises. Below are Mission's
                        comments on relationship <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and NATO
                        crises, analysed from point of view of French and of Five, followed by
                        conclusions re U.S. posture.</p>
                    <p>French. If French tactics are based on rational evaluation their own
                        interests—not necessarily a safe assumption—it is clearly very much in their
                        interest to keep NATO and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crises apart.
                        This means that French have every reason for wanting to avoid blow-up in
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> while they are fomenting major
                        crisis in NATO. There are at least two reasons for this. Looked at from
                        point of view of Moscow trip, it is obviously in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s interest to play a disruptive role re NATO
                        alliance but, by same token (if he wants to maintain pretension that he is
                        somehow speaking for Europe) to avoid an <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        crisis. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        capitulation at Luxembourg showed he recognized that Europe is indeed a
                        popular issue in France which he has to reckon with. Community sources
                        French nationality tell us that there is increasing recognition among
                        affected interest groups in France that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s NATO policy will adversely affect French <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> objectives.</p>
                    <p>If this analysis is correct, it is clear that pressure is on France, not
                        Five, to be conciliatory on <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> matters.
                        This, by the way, is the exact opposite of the conclusion reached by
                        Luxembourg economic official reported in Luxembourg's 254 to
                            Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">Not found.</note> It does,
                        however, represent overwhelming view within Commission and of at least two
                        PermDels (Dutch and German), who have explicitly stated position along these
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Results of Council meeting April 5 would seem to confirm that French
                        recognize burden is on them to prevent crisis in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. They appear to have pulled back from their earlier
                        insistence that absolute priority must be given to settlement of agriculture
                        financing.</p>
                    <p>Five. Basic issue which the Five will be wrestling with as NATO crisis
                        develops and becomes more acute will be extent to which they want to move
                        forward in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> with a Gaullist France
                        which is pulling out of the whole Western political and security structure.
                        There are signs of this basic concern, such as Luns' comments in the meeting
                        of the Fourteen in <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0386"/>Paris March 29
                        re the NATO crisis affecting the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the
                        view attributed to <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> that
                        agriculture financing should not be finally agreed until <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> returns from Moscow. However,
                        although there is a realistic assumption that evolving NATO crisis cannot
                        help but affect <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, there is heavy support
                        within Five for not invoking the NATO crisis in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, and for moving ahead with Community business in order to
                        enmesh <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> more and more in
                        European integration and preserve the Community structure for the
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> period. This does
                        not at all mean making one-sided concessions to the French on what they want
                        (agriculture financing), but rather an insistence upon meaningful parallel
                        progress on Kennedy Round and other items of interest to Five.</p>
                    <p>U.S. Active U.S. intervention here is clearly undesirable. However, we should
                        at least attempt to clarify our own views. Mission feels that our preference
                        should be for approach which Five are evolving: i.e., to extent possible,
                        balanced progress on internal Community issues and Kennedy Round, with these
                        issues considered on their merits and no conscious effort made to link
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and Kennedy Round with NATO crisis.
                        We must, however, also recognize that evolving NATO crisis is bound to
                        affect developments in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, especially if as
                        we expect political temperature will mount in NATO crisis. We for our part
                        must not give impression that we regard NATO crisis as a technical, easily
                        compartmentalized affair.</p>
                    <p>Major conclusion we draw from present situation is that, given fact that de
                        Gaulle, in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] words, “cannot tolerate” an <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis between now and French elections, we have an
                        exceptional opportunity to make progress on our key economic programs. This
                        applies in particular to Kennedy Round, which fortunately has become a major
                        Community issue. An exception to this is monetary reform, which unlike
                        Kennedy Round is not at center of Community bargaining. But on other issues
                        like Kennedy Round which are intimately related to European unity, French
                        will be very much on defensive until after their Parliamentary elections. I
                        believe we should take this very much into account and exploit this tactical
                        position by planning with our friends to seek maximum progress during next
                        year on those issues that are disdained by the General as “grubby” economic
                        matters, but which, he seems to realize, could become politically
                        embarrassing for him if his failure to permit progress led to a new <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                    <p>In its aide-memoire of March 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">See <ref target="#d142fn2">footnote 2, Document 142</ref>.</note> the
                        Government of France stated that the assignment to NATO of “the French
                        ground and air forces stationed in Germany” will end on July 1, 1966. The
                        French Foreign Minister has advised both the United States and the German
                        Government that France would leave these forces in Germany if the German
                        Government wanted them.</p>
                    <p>The agreement between France and the United States by which U.S. nuclear
                        weapons are stockpiled for the use of French forces in Germany is by its own
                        terms in effect only while those forces are committed to NATO.</p>
                    <p>The question of French forces in Germany is primarily of political
                        significance and not one of major military consequence. The United States is
                        in a position to influence, but not determine, the settlement of this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>How should the United States exercise its influence, and in what
                        direction?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">German Position:</p>
                    <p>The German Government released a statement on April 6 which states:</p>
                    <p>a) Germany intends to adhere to an Atlantic defense system based on peacetime
                        integration.</p>
                    <p>b) The Government intends to discuss the complex of questions, including that
                        of the presence of French forces in Germany, in the appropriate NATO forums
                        with all the other NATO partners.</p>
                    <p>c) The Government regards French troops in Germany as an important element of
                        the common defense and accordingly they should <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0388"/>assume a clearly defined mission in the framework of the
                        common defense of NATO and work together, in a way to be agreed, with NATO
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>d) In reaching an agreement on the stationing of French troops in Germany,
                        all the possibilities of the Franco-German Treaty are to be used after
                        coordination with the American and British governments as well as other NATO
                        governments. This will be done on the understanding that the rights and
                        obligations involved in the relationship of the Federal Republic to these
                        other partners will not be affected.</p>
                    <p>e) The goal of all efforts must be to maintain in full effectiveness the
                        functioning of the Alliance in the interest of all partners.</p>
                    <p>f) The German F.O. added orally “that the Cabinet, in addition to approving
                        the public statement, had taken certain other decisions … . A) That if the
                        French withdrew their forces from NATO their right to station troops in
                        Germany must in some way be ended; B) that the same principles must apply to
                        French troops in Germany as to German troops in France; C) other aspects of
                        the status of forces of French troops in Germany must be agreed.”<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">On April 6, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> along these same lines and suggested that the talks
                            be held at Bonn. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 4 NATO) On
                            April 8, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thanked Schroeder
                            for the German statement on the French forces, agreeing to hold them in
                            Bonn and naming <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> as U.S.
                            representative. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>These principles apparently indicate the sort of agreement under paragraphs
                        (c) and (d) above upon which the Germans would insist. In other words, in
                        some way or other the French troops in Germany must come under NATO command
                        in time of war, and assume a suitable task in time of peace and suitable
                        participation in planning and liaison. (See Bonn's 3177 and 3140.)<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Telegrams 3177 and 3140, April 6 and 5
                            respectively, summarized preliminary talks with the Germans on the
                            question of French troops in Germany. (Ibid., DEF 6 FR)</note> The
                        Germans appear firm on this.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The British Position:</p>
                    <p>As reported by the British Ambassador in Bonn's cable from Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, it is:</p>
                    <p>a) Their “overriding interest is not to disturb the framework of the 1954
                        agreements”.</p>
                    <p>b) “Satisfactory arrangements must be worked out for the French to revert to
                        NATO command in wartime. This should not be dependent on unilateral French
                        decision.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The United States Position:</p>
                    <p>In the discussions in Bonn the United States representative should support
                        the German Government position as stated on Pages 1 and 2. Since the issue
                        relates to the conditions upon which French troops <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0389"/>remain on German territory, the German
                        Government must play the primary role. The United States, however, has a
                        strong interest in this issue which affects the security of a large number
                        of its troops and the integrity of the arrangements under which they are
                        stationed in Germany.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. representative is not authorized to agree to any position or formula
                        which does not include (a) the same undertaking by the French Government as
                        by other governments having troops in Germany to place its troops in Germany
                        under command of the Commander in Chief Allied Forces Central Europe, in the
                        event of conflict involving any of the Allied forces stationed in Germany;
                        and (b) an undertaking to engage in planning so the forces can be used
                        effectively in time of war.</p>
                    <p>He should further point out that although the immediate conference deals only
                        and in a preliminary way with the question of French troops in Germany, no
                        final settlement of this question should be reached independently of a
                        settlement of the air problems. These include the part to be played by
                        French forces hitherto assigned to the air alert and air defense for Germany
                        as well as the necessary rights for all the Allies to overfly France.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiating Procedures</p>
                    <p>1) Joint positions should be developed initially among the U.S., UK, and
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. No final position should be taken
                        without consultation among the fourteen.</p>
                    <p>2) Discussions will take place in Bonn and a special mission headed by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName> will be sent from
                        Washington for this purpose.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>French forces in Germany presently consist of air and army units comprising
                        about 76,000 personnel. The air units are principally two wings of strike
                        aircraft of two squadrons each, and two Nike Missile Battalions. The army
                        forces comprise two divisions which include two Hawk AAA Battalions.</p>
                    <p>The French forces are almost reserve divisions, far back from the line and
                        not effectively trained, manned and equipped by U.S. standards. What
                        military value they have is very dependent upon French willingness to put
                        these forces under common command in wartime, engage in joint elaboration of
                        defense plans in peacetime, to cooperate in common post and field training
                        exercises. French forces in Germany in a completely “unattached” condition
                        and without the assignment of U.S. nuclear weapons would have a minus
                        military value if any.</p>
                    <p>France's right to maintain its forces in West Germany derives not from NATO
                        arrangements but from a series of agreements dating back to 1945. For
                        example, the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> of October 23, 1954, confirms the French
                        right to maintain its <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0390"/>troops in the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> up to the levels France had there at
                        the time of West Germany's entry into NATO (i.e., approximately the same as
                        now). Thus, even if France should cease to be a party to the North Atlantic
                        Treaty, France can argue that it retains the basic legal rights to maintain
                        troops in Germany. However, the response can be made that, under the complex
                        of the arrangements reached in 1954, the requirement of commitment of troops
                        in Germany to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> is legally binding
                        throughout the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the French forces are
                        subject to that legal requirement.</p>
                    <p>The French, however, have put the question of the maintenance of their forces
                        in Germany directly to the Germans as a matter of a new agreement, and legal
                        considerations are not likely to arise at the outset. If later on France
                        asserts a right to retain troops as an occupying power, the reaction in
                        Germany will be violent.</p>

                    <p>The Government of the United States acknowledges receipt of an aide-memoire
                        from the Government of the French Republic on March 29, 1966. The United
                        States Government has been and will continue to be in consultation with its
                        other Allies in NATO on the questions to which the actions of the Government
                        of the French Republic give rise, and which affect the security of all
                        members of NATO.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government takes note of the view expressed by the French
                        Government that the measures it proposes to take are made necessary “because
                        of the impossibility of amending, by mutual agreement and under satisfactory
                        conditions, the provisions in force in the North Atlantic Treaty
                        Organization.” The United States Government <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0391"/>calls the attention of the French Government to the fact
                        that the drafters of the North Atlantic Treaty recognized that changes might
                        occur in the factors “affecting peace and security in the North Atlantic
                        area.” They, therefore, provided, in Article 12 that, after ten years of the
                        operation of the Treaty, any Party should have the right to request a
                        consultation of the Parties “for the purpose of reviewing the Treaty.”</p>
                    <p>The United States Government recalls to the French Government that, having in
                        mind Article 12, it has, like many other NATO Governments, over the past
                        several years invited the French Government to submit any proposals it might
                        have for the revision of the Treaty or the Treaty Organization. Moreover, it
                        has assured the French Government that such suggestions would be given the
                        most careful consideration. The United States Government cannot, therefore,
                        understand the basis upon which the French Government has concluded, without
                        consulting the other Parties to the Treaty, that it is impossible to amend
                        the NATO arrangements and that it must act unilaterally. The United States
                        Government calls attention to the fact that the Declaration of Fourteen of
                        the member countries dated March 18, 1966, was issued only after the French
                        Government had given notice of its intentions to act unilaterally and
                        without advance consultation.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government takes note of the intention of the Government of
                        the French Republic to terminate the assignment to the Allied Command in
                        Europe of the French ground and air forces stationed in Germany on July 1,
                        1966. In doing so, the United States recalls that all forces stationed in
                        the area of Allied Command Europe were, by agreement, to be placed under the
                        authority of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, in conformity with
                        the 1954 London Final Act and the subsequent NATO Council resolution to
                        implement Section IV of the London Final Act. Furthermore, the Government of
                        the United States wishes to inform the Government of the French Republic
                        that upon the termination of such assignment the Agreement dated September
                        6, 1960, between the United States and France regarding the NATO Atomic
                        Stockpile of Weapons in Germany for Support of the Utilization by French
                        Forces Assigned to NATO would, by its own terms, cease to have
                        application.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government further notes the intention of the Government of
                        France to withdraw French personnel assigned to NATO commands, also to take
                        effect July 1, 1966, and from the NATO Defense College after July 23,
                        1966.</p>
                    <p>The aide-memoire states that “the withdrawal of the French elements assigned
                        to the Allied Commands and to the NATO College entails the transfer of the
                        headquarters of these bodies outside of French territory;” and that the
                        French Government believes that the transfers “might be completed by April
                        1, 1967.” On this alleged basis, the French Government has denounced the
                        Paris Protocol on the Status of International <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0392"/>Military Headquarters of August 28, 1952, to take effect on
                        April 1, 1967. It is not clear to the United States Government why the
                        intended withdrawals of French personnel should entail the removal of NATO
                        headquarters from France by April 1, 1967.</p>
                    <p>This entire subject is now under study among the other North Atlantic Treaty
                        Allies. Accordingly, it has not been determined when withdrawal of Allied
                        Headquarters would be accomplished. Consultations on this subject will be
                        necessary and it is the hope of the United States Government that all
                        Governments will approach further discussions of this matter in the spirit
                        of Allies seeking to reach agreement with minimum adverse effect upon the
                        security of the North Atlantic area and with as little mutual inconvenience
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>The aide-memoire further states the desire of the Government of France to
                        terminate United States military activities under certain bilateral
                        agreements freely entered into between France and the United States. These
                        agreements provide that they shall remain in force for the duration of the
                        North Atlantic Treaty unless the two Governments by mutual consent decide
                        beforehand to terminate them. They include the Chateauroux Depot Agreement
                        of February 27, 1951; the Air Bases Agreement of October 4, 1952; the United
                        States Military Headquarters Agreement of June 17, 1953; and the Pipeline
                        Agreement of June 30, 1953.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government cannot agree with the suggestion of the French
                        Government that April 1, 1967 “would be appropriate for completing the
                        necessary operations” with regard to the transfer of personnel and
                        installations involved in these agreements, but, on the contrary, believes
                        that such precipitate action could jeopardize the security interests of all
                        members of the Alliance. It notes, moreover, that the System of
                        Communications Agreement of December 8, 1958, between the United States and
                        France, provides that, if one party should wish to modify its terms, the
                        parties will consult, and that, if they are unable to come to agreement
                        within one year, that agreement may be terminated effective after a period
                        of one additional year. The United States Government expresses the view that
                        since this method of adjusting the position of the parties was considered to
                        be desirable when the System of Communications Agreement was concluded on
                        December 8, 1958, it remains so today and might appropriately be availed of
                        in consideration of the bilateral agreements concluded earlier, which by
                        their terms continue for the duration of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, while the United States intends to remove its facilities from
                        France as promptly as possible in view of the attitude of the French
                        Government, the United States Government would be prepared to give its
                        consent to the termination of the agreements referred to above only on the
                        condition that there be applied to all such agreements the provisions of
                        consultation and termination set forth in the System of Communications <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0393"/>Agreement. The United States
                        Government is prepared to explore with the French Government the question of
                        future United States military activities in France, together with
                        arrangements for the use of essential facilities, and mutually agreed
                        conditions for the orderly withdrawal of those facilities that are not to
                        remain in France. In this connection, the United States Government notes the
                        willingness of the French Government to make special provision for
                        activities authorized by the Chateauroux Depot Agreement of February 27,
                        1951 and the Pipeline Agreement of June 30, 1953.</p>
                    <p>United States activities under these Agreements between France and the United
                        States have been and continue to be in support of the North Atlantic Treaty.
                        Accordingly, it will be necessary in this case as well for the United States
                        Government to seek the views of its other Allies with regard to this aspect
                        of consultations with the Government of France.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States notes that the French Government is
                        prepared to begin conversations regarding mutual facilities which might be
                        made available in the event of an armed attack within the terms of the North
                        Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the attention of the French Government is called to the fact that
                        its actions in withdrawing from, abrogating or repudiating existing
                        agreements will entail financial problems and responsibilities that must be
                        taken into account in any discussion of these actions.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The crisis in NATO resulting from the French defection seems almost sure to
                        bring the problem of nuclear-sharing to the fore. In fact, the Dutch
                        Ambassador has called at the Department to urge that it be taken up again
                        since France has made discussion possible, and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0394"/>spoke to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> about it ten days ago in
                        Germany. The purpose of this memorandum is to suggest some considerations
                        you might want to think over while you are away. When you come back perhaps
                        Bob McNamara, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> and I might talk with you about
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I enclose a thumb-nail history of the problem,<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">Not printed.</note> beginning with 1960 and ending with the latest
                        correspondence between you, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>. The major issue of how
                        the West should handle the nuclear weapon in its common defense has gone
                        unresolved for five years for a number of reasons:</p>
                    <p>—The Germans have been uncertain as to how far they might safely claim a
                        nuclear role without antagonizing others, especially France. This has led
                        observers to interpret German desires variously, depending in part on their
                        own predilections.</p>
                    <p>—The British have been playing a game. They have been for abandoning their
                        independent nuclear weapon in principle, but against it in practice. They
                        have talked of equality for Germany but have been unwilling to give it. They
                        have advanced the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> as a substitute for
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>; then backed away from their own
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>—We ourselves have had to face divisions and uncertainties among our Allies;
                        concern in Congress that a nuclear-sharing proposal would fracture rather
                        than cement the Alliance; and the controversy over non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the Soviets have blamed, and will continue to blame, the failure
                        to conclude a non-proliferation treaty on Western desires to help Germany
                        “proliferate”.</p>
                    <p>We have asked ourselves these questions:</p>
                    <p>1. Is an early settlement of this problem more desirable than postponement of
                        it? We think the balance is in favor of an attempt to settle it, because
                        delay keeps open the argument between a hardware solution and other
                        solutions and prevents progress toward any solution. The continuance of this
                        problem helps the Russians make propaganda on the proliferation issue. It is
                        building up an issue between the British and the Germans; Chet Holifield
                        believes that the present crisis in NATO creates a possibility of bridging
                        German-British differences in such a way as to minimize Congressional
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>2. Is it possible to approach this issue without posing a direct
                        confrontation between a “hardware solution” and “consultation” only? We
                        believe this can be done as we outline below.</p>
                    <p>3. Should we urge the British and Germans to sit down with us and talk this
                        matter out over several days and at a cabinet level? We believe that in such
                        a talk we could narrow the differences by shaking out the <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0395"/>purely bargaining points and by putting
                        into the discussion what the U.S. could and could not do. Our own views may
                        modify the ideas of both of the others on the value of some of their own
                        positions. For instance, whether we would or would not support a “European
                        clause” would affect both the German and the British positions.</p>
                    <p>4. The procedure and plan we would like to discuss with you would be along
                        these lines:</p>
                    <p>To propose tripartite talks in Washington between the Foreign Ministers with
                        military advice. Bob and I would propose to work together in these
                        discussions. We think it would be better if Schroeder, rather than <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> spoke for Germany, and Stewart
                        rather than Healey for the UK.</p>
                    <p>To discuss at the same time, and not necessarily as alternatives, some form
                        of <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and a development of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee which has made a good
                        start.</p>
                    <p>To bring British and German ideas closer together and to reduce our own
                        Congressional problem we might try putting together the framework of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> and the consultative committee. But
                        we might try a more firm type of assignment of the submarines to a NATO
                        Supremo rather than purchase, and, instead of a European clause, a more
                        realistic commitment to review the whole nuclear situation when Europe
                        achieved some further degree of unity. It is rather fatuous to cause trouble
                        here over a European clause while <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> is vigorously engaged in destroying any immediate
                        prospect of movement toward unity.</p>
                    <p>We might also try to step up the possibilities of the committee. Fritz Erler,
                        a very sensible German Social Democrat, talks somewhat vaguely of a European
                        influence on the American deterrent going somewhat beyond planning. He does
                        not want to interfere at all in the decisive power of the U.S. President
                        over firing. The participation he appears to want is in the continued
                        creation of weapons systems which a President can fire, including, perhaps,
                        some European production or development work on some of the necessary
                        components. This, plus participation in planning military strategy and some
                        real political strategy in Europe, seem to him to go to the heart of the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>An exploration along these lines seems to us to offer promise. The idea would
                        not be to prepare a detailed plan which the Europeans can then unite in
                        criticizing but to devise a path we can gradually unfold to them as a way of
                        escape from their own deadlock and frustration.</p>
                    <p>These are only preliminary graspings for a line to be taken. When you have a
                        chance to mull them over, we would like to talk with you further in more
                        depth and to obtain your guidance.</p>

                    <p>3321. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> talks—meeting with
                        the Chancellor. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> met this morning for more
                        than an hour and a half with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> for a discussion of the French troop problem. Also
                        present on the German side were Schroeder, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>. The Chancellor's general
                        approach was firm—as he put it, “Hard if need be” since if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were allowed to keep his troops
                        in Germany without commitment while retaining their present status, Germany
                        would suffer a serious defeat with adverse consequences for all of Europe.
                        He showed concern, however, about the strength of public support for a firm
                        policy in the US and among the 14 in general. The Chancellor's judgment was
                        sober. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        probably would not accept the conditions which the Germans, in coordination
                        with their allies, would have to set for the retention of French troops in
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The following account is based on
                        an uncleared memorandum of conversation which will be pouched to the
                        Department tomorrow for transmission to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. In opening the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        said that he had followed with the closest attention the trilateral and
                        bilateral meetings which <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had
                        held in Bonn and was in full agreement with the general conclusions
                            reached.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> met privately with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> on April 15. This
                            meeting was followed by a meeting of U.S. and West German delegations.
                            (Telegrams 3305 and 3306 from Bonn, April 15 and 16; ibid., DEF 4 NATO
                            and POL 38–6) Later on April 15, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> met with British Ambassador Roberts and a second
                            trilateral meeting took place on April 16. (Telegrams 3307, 3312, and
                            3316 from Bonn, April 16; ibid., DEF 6 FR and POL 38–6) These meetings
                            resulted in the formation of a Bonn Working Group to discuss the
                            question of French forces in Germany and report to their Ministers. The
                            approved report would then be submitted to the other NATO Allies.</note>
                        Referring to his earlier talk with <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> at the Bilderberg conference in Wiesbaden, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that we must take a very
                        clear—and, if need be, hard—position vis-a-vis the French. “We Germans see
                        no other way out.” It was unprecedented in the post-war period for a Western
                        European country to openly violate its solemn agreements. He thought the
                        situation comparable to that which prevailed at the time of the Munich
                        crisis in 1938. He did not wish to compare personalities, but if we do not
                        stand together at this time the world could go apart. In the case of NATO,
                        maximum cohesion and unity is now required. The Chancellor stated, with
                        emphasis, that it is not only the right of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but its duty not to hesitate in the face of the situation
                            <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0397"/>brought about by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. It was necessary to draw the
                        necessary consequences no matter how much it might be hoped that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in the end would accept a
                        sensible solution.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> then outlined for the
                        Chancellor the US views as he had done previously for <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3305). He stressed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> by his actions had undermined two basic aspects of
                        NATO—(1) its credibility and (2) its provision of equality for Germany. He
                        was stimulating nationalism which would breed more nationalism. We are left
                        with something of a makeshift. The spirit which led to such major
                        accomplishments in the past as the Marshall Plan, NATO itself and the
                        defense of Berlin has been contaminated. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> now seeks the primacy of France rather than equality
                        among Europeans. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> noted that
                        it would require a high order of statesmanship to preserve NATO. The first
                        test would perhaps be the issue of French troops in Germany. He thought that
                        it was clear from the talks during the past two days that the Germans,
                        British and ourselves were in agreement that if the French troops can play a
                        useful military role it is desirable that they remain. If arrangements are
                        not possible which would assure this, however, they could become a military
                        liability. The President and the Secretary of State had come to the
                        conclusion that the United States should support any position taken by the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> that recognized the seriousness of
                        the situation and provided an adequate response to the French. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must itself decide the position it wishes
                        to occupy in Europe. We are not thinking in terms of forcing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> toward any policy or decision. We only wish
                        to make entirely clear that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has full
                        US support.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed satisfaction with
                        this US position. He said that Germany can only accept the presence of
                        French troops under conditions that are satisfactory with regard to their
                        status and their military role. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is also in a difficult position. The General can
                        hardly accept the German conditions for the retention of French troops
                        without going back on the principles underlying his attack against NATO. On
                        the other hand if we hold firm, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> will not find it pleasant to withdraw his troops.
                        Either way, he will in effect suffer a defeat. The Chancellor thought that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> at present was playing
                        a poker game. The German side cannot back down on the conditions for the
                        retention of troops, conditions which he thought were those wished by all
                        the other NATO powers.</p>
                    <p>5. The Chancellor then asked concerning public opinion in the US. Would there
                        be a tendency among Americans to query whether it was worthwhile to bring
                        about a deterioration in Franco-German relations and a weakening of NATO
                        simply because of questions of form and legality? For him there was no
                        question but what the Fourteen must remain firm. If together we do not face
                        the present situation, “we shall not be worth much in the future”. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> should be permitted to
                            <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0398"/>retain his forces in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> uncommitted but with undiminished status
                        this would be a defeat for Germany. The question for Erhard was up to what
                        point would the Fourteen stand firm. What will be the effect of public
                        opinion?</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> replied that there would be
                        elements in the US who would indeed take the attitude that the issue posed
                        by the status and task of French forces was not of sufficient importance to
                        risk a break with France. Others would be disturbed by the increased status
                        in the Alliance which Germany would attain with France's withdrawal. Still
                        others would say that the situation in Western Europe was so hopelessly
                        complicated that the best course would be to try to reach an agreement with
                        the Soviets. None of these, however, represented the prevalent attitude in
                        the US. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> thought that the
                        American public generally recognizes the stubborn and obdurate attitude of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. They feel that our
                        general policy in Europe in the post-war period has been right and they do
                        not like to see the basis of this policy attacked by the French. There is no
                        serious body of public opinion at all in America which would favor a deal
                        with the USSR.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was convinced that the British
                        would “Join up and stand with us through it all”. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> replied that he did not personally
                        know <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> very well but felt that
                        in the trilateral discussions, Roberts had presented a very good British
                        position. Somewhat later in the conversation <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> returned to this point and said he wished to make
                        clear he had no doubts as to British loyalty to the Alliance. He has posed
                        the question only because it was so important that the three powers be
                        united if the impression of a bilateral US-German approach was to be
                        avoided. The Chancellor thought this important for the other members of the
                        Alliance. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> interposed that he
                        intended to make a special effort to get to the Dutch and Italians in view
                        of the helpful roles they had played at Brussels (the Italians with a grain
                        of salt, he added).</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> then recalled that at
                        Bilderberg <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had told him that
                        the US has 90,000 overflights annually over France. If it comes to the worst
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> threatens to withhold
                        permission for these, how can the situation be handled? <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that he had talked with the
                        military men and there was no doubt that the overflight problem caused
                        concern. With modern planes much elbow room is required. The matter is
                        troubling but <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> did not think
                        our military considered this a determining factor in the situation. An
                        alternative would be found even though, to use the term <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> had used in an earlier meeting, it
                        would have to be a makeshift. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> thought the French were perhaps overplaying their
                        unconcern about possible exclusion from the early warning system. He
                        accepted <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>'s view that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may not approach this
                        problem from what we would consider a rational basis; but he still felt that
                        the French position was a little “over <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0399"/>studied”. Overflights contributed directly to the security
                        of France, a fact which the French cannot completely overlook.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> next asked if <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> thought the financial demands that
                        would be made against the French for the removal of NATO facilities and
                        possibly for debts to the US arising from the war would be of any political
                        value. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said he thought
                        probably not. No one really expects that the French will pay. The idea of
                        reviving old war debts would hardly impede <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> from his present plans. We could in theory claim all
                        the military equipment given to France under the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. On the whole, however, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> thought that the only two things that would influence
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were (1) the solidarity
                        of the Fourteen and (2) public opinion in France. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> commented that French public opinion seemed to have
                        been more united against de Gaulle on the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> question than on NATO. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> agreed. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        then again reiterated that the Germans will not give in to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on basic issues. They would do
                        everything to avoid an impression that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was acquiescing in a revival of French occupation. For this
                        reason he felt that the greater probability was that it would not be
                        possible to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with the French.</p>
                    <p>10. In response to the Chancellor's question as to the President's attitude,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that while he had
                        not had an opportunity to speak directly with the President, the President
                        had personally concurred in the US decision to support fully a strong <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> commented than anyone who
                        knows <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>—as <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and he did—realizes that the
                        General is capable of anything. One has to be prepared for the worst.
                        Suppose, he said, we are not able to reach agreement with the French but the
                        French forces stay anyway. What do we do? <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> laughingly interjected that the Germans would cut
                        off the electricity, water, etc. Slightly more seriously, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that before it reached this
                        point <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would “mobilize his
                        fifth column in Germany”. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        brushed this aside by saying that the fifth column wasn't very big any
                        more.</p>
                    <p>12. Turning to the question of the 1954 agreements, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that he understood there was
                        general unity that these agreements constituted one entity. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that the US Government was
                        prepared to support the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in this position
                        although the legal situation was a complex one. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> added that the British were a bit more
                        differentiated in their attitude because of their concern for the status of
                        Berlin and the Western position vis-a-vis the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> considered this a very decisive
                        question. If we were to allow others to split up the 1954 agreements we
                        would be “giving trump cards to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>”. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        agreed on the importance of this point and noted that it would be studied in
                        the working group. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>—directing
                        his comments to the Chancellor—said that he thought the simplest and at the
                        same time most persuasive <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0400"/>argument
                        was that the withdrawal by France of its forces from NATO commitment
                        inevitably affects the status of their presence in Germany.</p>
                    <p>13. When the question of possible effect on Live Oak of French actions came
                        up, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that he could not
                        imagine that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would withdraw
                        from all of the powers and rights which France has as one of the victorious
                        powers. He asked in this connection whether <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> felt that the Soviets take <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> seriously. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> replied that the Soviets were
                        intent on exploiting divisions in the West and would utilize France for
                        purpose. In the end, however, they were basically interested in real power.
                        Turning to <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> had thought of the possibility that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might propose a special
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> prior to the
                        Moscow trip in order to “put on the thumb screws”. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that he had thought of it but
                        that “given <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s overriding
                        interest in scenic effect”, he doubted that he would come to Bonn before
                        going to Moscow, and Bonn would be the site of the next Franco-German heads
                        of government meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        wished to go to Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                        said, with the stage clear.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s final question was when
                        would the US Government enter into bilateral talks with France regarding our
                        bases there? <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that he did
                        not know precisely. Our general disposition is not to refuse to talk about
                        withdrawing our troops. We have no desire to keep troops in France longer
                        than is necessary if the French oppose them. He had the impression that the
                        legalistic position taken in our reply to the March 29 French aide-memoire
                        was partly a bargaining ploy. We did not intend to drag things out
                        indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>The conversation ended with the Chancellor asking <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to convey his warm greetings to the
                        President.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>On the basis of State Department papers you have been considering the issue
                        of French troops in Germany and the framework for our response to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> on the nuclear question.</p>
                    <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0401"/>
                    <p>You have also had available Francis <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName>'s observations.</p>
                    <p>At the moment, I can, perhaps, be most helpful by setting down a few
                        fundamental ideas which I believe are relevant to these matters in
                        particular and the Atlantic crisis in general.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The maintenance of an integrated NATO capable of
                            continuing to deter Moscow is fundamental</hi>. Given Soviet missile and
                        conventional capabilities, it is truly a mortal issue. Here I believe Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> is wholly correct. It is
                        not a question of clinging to outmoded ideas of the late 1940's: it is a
                        question of whether we and the Europeans have learned the lesson of two
                        world wars and the whole sweep of modern history.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In order to maintain the political base for this
                            deterrent—under French attack—the U.K. and Germany must be brought
                            closer together</hi>. This is the way to look at the nuclear issue. We
                        need to sit down with the U.K. and Germany and quietly guide them to a
                        well-balanced package. The first requirement is tripartite talk; but we
                        should not deceive ourselves that anything will emerge unless we push them
                        tactfully towards a package, including, in particular, the nuclear issue and
                        the defense of the pound.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">On the nuclear issue I have no pet formula</hi>. I am
                        clear, however, on two things:</p>
                    <p>a. at the moment the Germans do not have the political and psychological base
                        to foreclose a hardware option once and for all, without a major concession
                        from Moscow in the direction of German unity;</p>
                    <p>b. we ought to put our best thought and imagination into designing a lively
                        nuclear consultation club, hardware or no hardware. The design and
                        negotiation of this consultation club are first priority business on which
                        the whole town agrees.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">We ought to do nothing that need not be done to make
                            Franco-German relations worse than <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has made them</hi>. We ought to understand with
                        sympathy the German desire to keep as much going as possible between France
                        and Germany. But we also ought to be clear about two other matters, to the
                        Germans as well as among ourselves:</p>
                    <p>a. It is Paris, not Washington, that is pressing on the Germans a choice
                        between France and the U.S.;</p>
                    <p>b. Franco-German friendship can only thrive in larger clubs—like the European
                        Common Market and NATO. It will not work on a bilateral basis, except
                        student exchanges, etc.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">We ought to accompany the NATO reorganization with as
                            many forward-looking measures in the Atlantic as possible</hi>. The case
                        for keeping NATO is widely understood. But there is also a correct feeling
                        that we need:</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">More partnership in the Atlantic</hi> on issues like
                        money, aid, space, modern technology, Great Society issues, political
                        consultation, etc.;</p>
                    <p>b. More East-West bridge-building by Atlantic nations: trade, cultural
                        contacts, etc.</p>
                    <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0402"/>
                    <p>We should not become so overwhelmed with the difficult details of moving
                        NATO, negotiating with the French, facing the issues of French troops in
                        Germany, that we fail to give the whole enterprise a new forward look.
                        Planning is under way; but, unless you insist on its being given a priority
                        equal to other matters, it may be pushed aside as window-dressing. It is
                        more than that. It may determine how positively European parliaments and
                        public opinion react to the new NATO package as a whole. Indeed, the same
                        may be true in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>6. I shall, of course, be prepared to comment on specific points and issues
                        as they come forward for your decision. At this time, I thought these broad
                        observations might be helpful.</p>
                    <p>7. My only operational proposal is this: <hi rend="italic">that you budget
                            for a small, carefully prepared meeting on the nuclear question shortly
                            after your return to Washington</hi>. The town needs your guidance. I
                        believe I can lay it out for discussion in an orderly way.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> that I was disappointed
                        that the French Government had not considered it suitable to accept the
                        suggestion we had made for the termination. I said this suggestion would
                        have provided a legal basis for the common consent provided for in the
                        agreements as well as certain additional time to complete practical
                        measures. I added that following my visit this week to some of our bases in
                        France I could tell him that it would be physically impossible to complete
                        the closing of the bases within the time fixed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that they were not
                        denouncing the agreements, to which I replied that I thought we should not
                        have a play on words since in effect they were terminating the agreements by
                        unilateral action whereas the agreements specifically provided in four of
                        the cases for their termination by mutual consent if they concurred before
                        the expiration of the treaty. I told him I did not know what the American
                        reaction would be but I could only take note of the fact that his government
                        was in violation of the terms of the existing agreement. I also told him
                        that we could not accept the one year date fixed in the French memorandum
                        and if we did negotiate it would have to be under some form of juridical
                        protest in regard to this date.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that the date was of
                        course something that could be discussed and that it was not intended to be
                        an absolute fixed date in all cases. I repeated what I had said previously.
                        I pointed out that the reference to military authorities in suggesting Paris
                        as a locale might give the idea that it was a French proposal that it should
                        be a military discussion. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said
                        no, this was definitely not the case and the only reason the military had
                        been mentioned was to underline the fact that there were competent American
                        military on the spot here in Paris. He said what they envisaged from their
                        side was Beaumarchais and de <persName corresp="#p_DGJC1">la
                            Grandville</persName>. I told him that we wouldn't have any ideas as to
                        our negotiating team until we had accepted the idea in principle.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> then asked me what did I think
                        about publishing the aide-memoire and I said as a personal opinion I thought
                        it would be desirable to publish it since there had been a great deal of
                        speculation in the French press as to its contents, some of which had been
                        very close to the mark. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said it
                        was immaterial to them whether it was published or not and he had only
                        thought there should be an end to the “polemics” in the press.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the French would publish on Sunday for Monday morning
                        papers unless the Department has other ideas, in which case we will notify
                        the Foreign Office over the weekend. If we hear nothing the French will go
                        ahead with the agreed arrangement.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President wishes to have developed recommendations for enlarging the
                        participation in and understanding of nuclear planning by both the political
                        and military authorities of our major NATO allies.</p>
                    <p>Two alternative approaches should be considered: one which assumes the
                        creation of a “NATO Nuclear Force” and one which does not.</p>
                    <p>Among the possibilities examined should be the creation of a permanent body
                        of restricted membership within NATO with functions including both
                        intensified consultation and the direction of U.S. and U.K. nuclear weapons
                        and delivery vehicles assigned to NATO and/or collectively owned. The
                        proposals should cover the full range of activities involved in planning for
                        the operation of existing forces and the development of future forces:
                        intelligence, deployment, targeting, considerations affecting use at times
                        of crisis, research, development, production and budgeting, etc.</p>
                    <p>The primary operational focus of these arrangements should be the defense of
                        NATO territory.</p>
                    <p>For purposes of this exercise, it should be assumed that any “NATO Nuclear
                        Force” Plan which later may be agreed upon will not include:</p>
                    <p>a. Mixed-manning of submarines;</p>
                    <p>b. A surface fleet capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The following
                        matters should be addressed, in addition to functions:</p>
                    <p>1. participation or membership;</p>
                    <p>2. location;</p>
                    <p>3. financing;</p>
                    <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0405"/>
                    <p>4. probable U.K., German, French, other NATO and Soviet reactions;</p>
                    <p>5. appropriate U.S. negotiating strategy and procedures for its
                        execution.</p>
                    <p>The President also wishes to have developed other forward-looking proposals
                        that would increase the cohesion of NATO and the North Atlantic community.
                        These should embrace two kinds of measures:</p>
                    <p>a. Military and non-military programs affecting primarily the affairs of the
                        Free World;</p>
                    <p>b. Constructive political, diplomatic, and economic initiatives addressed to
                        Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes to have these proposals ready for review by Thursday,
                        May 12.</p>

                            would be tempted to take advantage of the present crisis in NATO, but
                            the fact remained that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            was forcing it to take positions that it would not have asserted on its
                            own initiative. (Ibid.)</note> For the Secretary and the Under
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. I welcome the expression of views in reftel on the effects of the
                        France-NATO crisis on Germany. The possible consequences outlined in the
                        reftel would clearly represent the most desirable outcome. It is to be hoped
                        that events will follow such a course. No doubt Germany's role will be
                        enhanced by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s recent
                        actions, and it will be a challenge for US policy in the period ahead to
                        encourage Germany to play a responsible role in the Atlantic Alliance and in
                        Europe. At the same time, there remains in Europe a deep distrust of
                        Germany. Nor must we close <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0406"/>our eyes
                        to the possibility that other, less desirable consequences could derive from
                        a NATO-wide confrontation with France—in which the FedRep is called upon to
                        play a key role.</p>
                    <p>2. Two points in this respect will bear particularly close watching. One is
                        the effect on the FedRep's European policy—if an estrangement with France
                        should occur. If the present confrontation results in a withdrawal of French
                        forces from the FedRep, German public opinion will not react with
                        exhilaration. Many will see in it a defeat for the carefully nurtured
                        German-French friendship—and for Europe. Many will ask themselves with whom
                        Germany could now seek to build Europe. After dinner last evening Min
                            <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, State Sec <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hase</persName>, and Baden-Wurttemberg Min Pres
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> all expressed dismay at
                        the possible withdrawal of French troops. They greatly fear the political
                        consequences of a French withdrawal, which they seem to feel is now quite
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>3. If as a result of a French-German rift, European unity seems increasingly
                        less attainable, there will inevitably be a tendency here, as we have
                        pointed out, to turn more actively toward the other elusive goal of German
                        policy—reunification. The problem which would then confront us—as well as
                        Germany's other partners—is the extent to which we can in fact help Germany
                        to attain this goal. In this game, key cards are held by the other side.</p>

                        CRISIS</p>
                    <p>In approaching any negotiation it is important to understand clearly the
                        relationship of the parties. Are they seeking a common object and sparring
                        for compatible individual advantage—as in a horse trade? If so, bargaining
                        is the avenue to agreement. If, however, one has taken a position from which
                        it will not recede, and from which it cannot be forced to recede, there is
                        small room for negotiation.</p>
                    <p>In the past weeks the French government has been at pains to demonstrate the
                        latter is its attitude towards NATO. It will not discuss its <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0409"/>decisions that French troops must be
                        withdrawn from commitment to NATO command and French officers from service
                        in NATO commands. Similarly its demands that all NATO and U.S. command
                        headquarters and all U.S. troops, facilities and supplies must be withdrawn
                        from France are not subject to negotiation. All that can be discussed are
                        “practical measures” for carrying out these decisions, a deadline for which
                        the French government has arbitrarily set. Even the French Ministry of
                        Defense admits that so far as NATO facilities and headquarters are concerned
                        these dates cannot be met.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has responded that its troops and
                        facilities will be withdrawn from French territory as soon as this can be
                        done without prejudice to military security. There are no negotiations
                        required about withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has offered to negotiate the
                        amendment or cancellation of the agreements under which the facilities were
                        established. It has not been thought compatible with the dignity of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to accept unilateral cancellation of
                        agreements made for the life of NATO. Nor has acceptance of unilateral
                        cancellation seemed appropriate when the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>
                        simultaneously offered to discuss new agreements about reentry into France
                        in time of war. The French government has not answered the offer to
                        negotiate the agreements. The draft aide-memoire submitted by you to the
                            President<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">This particular draft has not been
                            further identified.</note> seeks to make the record clear on this
                        important point, without haggling about our withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>What Can Be Negotiated and Its Importance</p>
                    <p>The impressive fact is how little of any real importance is open to
                        negotiation in the France-NATO crisis.</p>
                    <p>The indisputable fact is that France wants everything French out of NATO, and
                        everything NATO—especially everything American—out of France. This, if one
                        may say so, poses a rather clear cut issue.</p>
                    <p>In the political field it is paralleled by another equally clear cut
                        difference. As was made clear to Senator Church in Paris recently,<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Senator Church's conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on May 4 was summarized in
                            telegram 7498 from Paris, May 5. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            Vol. 3.</note> the French government wants a European settlement by
                        Europeans, i.e., by “the underlying reality of Europe … Russia in Eastern
                        Europe and France, England and to a lesser extent Italy in Western Europe …
                        the other countries of Europe were so much dust … .” The agreement would
                        seek a “reunited Germany without nuclear arms and the withdrawal of foreign
                        forces from such a Germany, including, of course, military forces <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0410"/>of the United States.” To most
                        Western Europeans simple mathematics makes this appear as Soviet domination
                        of Europe. Our allies have not seen this issue of policy as a
                        misunderstanding which can be talked out. The parties are not separated by
                        details. They are poles apart.</p>
                    <p>The NATO Fourteen, to be sure, have matters which must be talked out with the
                        French; but they are of relatively minor importance. How insistent will the
                        French be in pushing a hurried evacuation of NATO establishments? In
                        limiting NATO overflights? In pinching off the flow of oil across France? Is
                        it in the interest of NATO to cloak the withdrawal of France from the
                        Alliance? How valuable is French liaison with the NATO commands, and how
                        much reliance can be placed on an agreement to use French facilities in time
                        of conflict.</p>
                    <p>The matters which stand out from the mechanics of leaving France are:</p>
                    <p>1) The presence of French troops in Germany.</p>
                    <p>2) Allied overflights through French air space.</p>
                    <p>3) Continued transportation of oil across France.</p>
                    <p>4) Reentry rights into facilities in France in case of war.</p>
                    <p>There is also a matter which concerns chiefly the United States—the
                        termination of valid bilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1) The presence of French troops in Germany</p>
                    <p>The presence of all foreign troops in Germany is governed by a series of
                        agreements of 1954, one of which requires their being committed to NATO
                        command in case of conflict. The French government has given notice of the
                        cancellation of this commitment so far as their forces are concerned (two
                        and one- third divisions and some air units) on July 1st.</p>
                    <p>Both the Germans and the other allies have seen the issues raised here by the
                        French as primarily political rather than military. The Germans have
                        accordingly informed the French, with the unanimous concurrence of the other
                        thirteen allies, that the continued presence of French troops in Germany
                        would be welcomed provided a new agreement was reached regarding their
                        mission and their commitment to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>
                        command in the time of conflict. To make this specific the note proposed
                        that the transfer of command take place when all other troops in Germany
                        should have come under <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s command.
                        This proposal was to resolve the ambiguity introduced by the French
                        interpretation of the NAT as committing them to defend against “unprovoked”
                        attack. Both French and German positions may be negotiable.</p>
                    <p>Despite dialectical form, the heart of the allied position is that unless
                        troops in Germany are unequivocally there on a joint allied defense mission
                        under the treaty, their status reverts to occupation forces in what General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> described to Senator
                        Church as a defeated and <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0411"/>divided
                        country. The divisive effect of such a result is a net loss to the
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of current intelligence, the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>
                        is discussing this week whether or not to negotiate this matter. Apparently
                        it would wish in any event to withdraw the troops after the February–March
                        French elections. It may decide to do so during the summer.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) Allied overflights through French air space</p>
                    <p>The right to conduct military overflights in France is of very substantial
                        importance to us and the Alliance. Without the use of French air space NATO
                        air communications between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean area are
                        possible only by following a long and wasteful route over the Atlantic. The
                        right to continue training flights over France is equally important, since
                        air space over Germany, the UK and the Benelux countries is not as suited
                        for such flights because of traffic congestion and recurrent bad weather.
                        Aware of this, the French have reduced overflight agreements with the U.S.
                        and other NATO countries to a month-to-month basis.</p>
                    <p>French need to overfly other NATO countries and to have access to information
                        from the early warning system should provide the Alliance with strong
                        bargaining position in negotiating continued overflight rights. Without such
                        information and overflight rights the Force de Frappe would lose whatever
                        credibility it now has.</p>
                    <p>However, reports of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s discussion of this matter indicate he rules out the
                        possibility of a Soviet attack on Europe, and hence regards of little
                        immediate value French access to air defense information and foreign air
                        space. Nevertheless, the situation itself puts some pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>. To take an extreme position would be
                        inconsistent with that of an ally. It would suggest more neutrality or
                        hostility. This together with the keener appreciation of the situation held
                        by the French military may maintain tolerable overflight rights.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3) Continued transportation of oil across France</p>
                    <p>The last French aide-memoire, while contemplating ending the flow of oil
                        across France through our pipeline to U.S. forces in Germany, indicated some
                        realization of the high-handedness of this action. It suggested France might
                        not insist upon terminating use in one year. This action is so outrageous as
                        to warrant a rather full and public exploration of the grounds put forward
                        as justification for it and a claim for just compensation for the
                        nationalization of the facility. The aide-memoire recently forwarded to the
                        President lays the foundation for this.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4) Reentry rights into facilities in France in case
                        of war</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> has offered to discuss this subject
                        with the interesting qualification that it cover only situations in which
                        both nations are at war. <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0412"/>Since the
                        only wars concerned are those which involve action under Article 5 of the
                        NAT, the qualification indicates awareness of the possibility that the U.S.
                        might be at war in Europe when France might not be. This qualification ought
                        to be plumbed to see how firmly it is held and what it may mean.</p>
                    <p>If significance is attached to it, the value of reentry rights obtainable is
                        much diminished. One would certainly not be justified in placing much
                        reliance on them in planning for the security of our large forces in
                        Germany. Nevertheless, they would be worth negotiating to have a framework
                        of agreement regarding, and possibly custodial forces maintaining, some
                        facilities which another French government might make really useful.</p>
                    <p>The exercise of negotiating the agreement, therefore, could well be
                        worthwhile, as was the negotiation of the Austrian State Treaty. One can
                        never tell when a document of this sort can come in handy. The United States
                        would not be justified in making any concessions of importance to get
                        it.</p>

                    <p>1. Spanish Ambassador called on Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> May 16 to present aide-memoire re Spanish aims in
                            Europe.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s conversation with Ambassador

                    </p>
                    <p>2. a. Ambassador said Spain seeks join in Common Market and in Western
                        defense organization with full rights. Need for early action on <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0413"/>application to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arose from growing Spanish trade deficit with Six. This
                        caused by rising imports permitted by trade liberalization to conform to
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and by increasing level <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> protection against Spanish exports as
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> customs union takes effect. Noted
                        latest <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council decisions this
                        regard.</p>
                    <p>b. Spanish efforts to attain membership thus far delayed and obstructed for
                        political reasons by Italy, Belgium and Netherlands motivated by ideological
                        and sentimental considerations. Their opposition injurious to Spanish
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>c. Unless progress made on Spanish admittance to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, Spain would be obliged resort to discriminatory measures.
                        This would include invocation <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        safeguard clauses for developing countries and refusal military and other
                        facilities to states opposing Spanish admission to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>d. Germany understands that its access to Spanish facilities depends on
                        support for Spanish participation in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.
                        French also helpful. But Italians incomprehensibly opposed. Spain has
                        assumed burden Italian defense by accepting Polaris missiles at Rota
                        allowing withdrawal <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>'s from Italy. Yet,
                        in return, Italy has extracted excessive commercial benefits within <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> which harmful to Spain.</p>
                    <p>e. When NATO reformed Spain would hope to be associated in some way with new
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>3. Spanish aide-memoire concluded that “Spanish Government is not requesting
                        special action from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.” But hoped <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would express support for Spanish inclusion
                        in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to Community and support member
                        governments acting on Spanish behalf. Spanish Ambassador added, speaking
                        personally, that he was sure Spanish ForMin wished US would speak forcefully
                        to Italy.</p>
                    <p>4. Under Secretary assured Ambassador of US concern for Spanish problems and
                        recalled that US as well has difficulties with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural policies. However, he was non-committal on
                        specifics of Spanish demarche and avoided stating any US position on Spanish
                        link with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Under Secretary cautioned
                        Spanish Ambassador that US would wish to give most careful consideration to
                        Spanish aide-memoire. We were convinced that any intervention likely to
                        provoke adverse reaction in view well-known sensitivity of Six. Noted that
                        in view of current NATO crisis and problems in NATO/France relations these
                        sensitivities likely to be heightened.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Department by no means clear from
                        Ambassador's presentation and reports from addressee posts precisely what

                    <p>—On French troops in Germany (the hottest near-term political issue), the
                        U.S.-UK-German working group in Bonn has circulated to the Fourteen its
                        report on how we should negotiate.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">A copy of

                        State and Defense have been working hard on the nuclear issue, and on
                        constructive proposals for the Alliance, in response to NSAM 345.<note n="5" xml:id="d165fn5">

                        package will be ready at the end of the week.</p>
                    <p>—You should consider a major speech on European policy before <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> goes to Moscow (June 20). Many
                        Europeans (including Lecanuet)<note n="6" xml:id="d165fn6"> Jean Lecanuet,
                            French Senator.</note> have suggested its wisdom at this stage.</p>
                    <p>How we play our hand during the next several weeks will not only help
                        determine the future shape of the Alliance, but will seriously affect German
                        and European politics, and might even affect our own.</p>
                    <p>We will need Presidential guidance specifically on: (1) our <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0416"/>negotiating position on French troops in
                        Germany, (2) whether to send another aide-memoire on defense arrangements to
                        the French, and (3) our overall negotiating stance.</p>
                    <p>There is a further reason for early Presidential involvement. Some of your
                        advisers—notably <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>—are a bit shellshocked from newspaper
                        stories suggesting that they are at odds with you. This is bad business for
                        us and makes the Europeans, particularly the Germans, uneasy. Your giving
                        them a day in court, and then your personal guidance, should permit us to
                        be—and appear to be—a united and purposeful government.</p>

                    <p>The rest of this memo contains our thoughts on what might be the agenda for
                        such a meeting: (1) U.S. objectives in the NATO crisis; (2) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s objectives; (3) our public
                        position vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>; (4) our
                        negotiating position on French troops in Germany; (5) whether to send an
                        aide-memoire or communicate our response in some other way; and (6) general
                        negotiating instructions.</p>
                    <p rend="center">1. U.S. Objectives</p>
                    <p>There is little disagreement on essential U.S. interests. We must try to:</p>
                    <p>—maintain an effective integrated deterrent, providing for the security of
                        U.S. and Allied forces in Europe;</p>
                    <p>—maintain solidarity among the Fourteen. (This requires that our position
                        vis-a-vis the French appear to the others as reasonable on its merits, while
                        generating sufficient realism and determination among the Fourteen to face
                        the expensive problem posed for us by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s high-handed and disruptive decisions. It also
                        requires that we continue to make clear our commitment to an evolving
                        constructive NATO, which can serve as a base for a policy of bridge-building
                        to the East.)</p>
                    <p>—minimize the strain on German politics by (1) helping <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> resolve the French troops issue along
                        lines most acceptable in terms of long-run German politics, and (2) by
                        making generally clear that they can count on U.S. support when they want to
                        be firm, and on U.S. understanding for any efforts to keep the Franco-German
                        rift to a minimum;</p>
                    <p>—impose a price on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, while
                        leaving an empty chair for France. (Punishing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> verbally is not serious or useful business. But it is
                        essential for our security—and for the negotiation—that we be (and appear to
                        be) capable of mounting an effective integrated deterrent without France. He
                        remains, despite his stance, politically vulnerable in his domestic politics
                        to isolation from the rest of the West.)</p>
                    <p rend="center">2. What <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                        after</p>
                    <p>How he actually will play his hand we don't know. He evidently wants maximum
                        freedom of action and yet appear to the French people to have the protection
                        of the Alliance. Much depends on what he gets or doesn't get in Moscow, and
                        on the unity of the Fourteen. His operational goals in relation to NATO are
                        probably somewhere on a spectrum bounded by:</p>
                    <p>(a) a neutralist position: with French troops out of Germany; France out of
                        NATO; and no special defense arrangements with the U.S. or other Allies;
                        and</p>
                    <p>(b) a diluted NATO: where France keeps her troops in Germany; maintains her
                        membership in NATO planning groups and early warning network; permits allied
                        overflights; and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> remains in Paris.</p>
                    <p>During his Moscow trip, it is a fair bet that he will try to get the Russians
                        to hold out just enough of a promise of movement toward German <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0417"/>unity to bedevil German political life
                        without cutting the ground from under Ulbricht. If the Russians don't play,
                        he is more likely to opt for a diluted NATO and against a neutralist
                        position.</p>
                    <p>What is clear, irrespective of what happens in Moscow, is that as a
                        negotiator he will go to great lengths to be in a position of granting
                        favors and not asking them.</p>
                    <p rend="center">3. The importance of how we look</p>
                    <p>The safest bet is that except on overflights, the French will be unreasonable
                        and negotiations will be unsuccessful. <hi rend="italic">The issue which is
                            not addressed in the Acheson memo is what posture we strike in testing
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s intentions.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here there is a difference of emphasis among your advisers:</p>
                    <p>—Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> believe that we must, both in public and private,
                        talk about the serious consequences of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s unilateral decisions, and to take a fairly hard
                        line. Their reasons are: this is an expensive, difficult business he has
                        imposed on us, and if we fudge over what he has done, the European (and
                        perhaps U.S.) public, parliaments, and Congress will not put up the
                        resources to maintain an integrated deterrent. The Italians and Danes, for
                        example, might slide away towards detached positions; and the Germans might
                        move towards bilateralism vis-a-vis both Paris and Washington.</p>
                    <p>—Sect. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doesn't want to argue
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> much, but simply get
                        on with the job of building an integrated, streamlined deterrent without
                        France, negotiating in the quietest way possible.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> has (in Rostow's view,
                        correctly) emphasized for some time the need for us to take positions which
                        (1) do not get beyond what <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> can
                        manage in domestic politics, and which (2) do not unduly strain political
                        life in other NATO countries. He wants to be sure that, if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will not accept those minimum
                        conditions which we and the Germans must really insist upon, it will be
                        clear to the world that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        alone is responsible for the breakdown—that the monkey is on his back.</p>
                    <p>The State Department has tended to take positions a bit harder than those we
                        could live with and let others water them down in negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The other way to play it is to state positions closer to the minimum; hold to
                        them; and avoid the charge of being unreasonable with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The State Department should be heard attentively, because they are on the
                        firing line. But Rostow's net view (in which <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> concurs) is:</p>
                    <p>—We probably will not be able to avoid some public discussion of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s position, given Church,
                        Fulbright, etc.; but that discussion and statements of our differences
                        should be precise and temperate.</p>
                    <p>—The key to the negotiation is action to put NATO in a position where it can
                        live and operate with or without France.</p>
                    <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0418"/>
                    <p>—We are strong enough to state moderate positions and hold to them in
                        negotiations with both France and our Allies.</p>
                    <p>The balance here is so delicate that each key issue must be looked at
                        separately.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. French troops in Germany—how we negotiate</p>
                    <p>As you know, until now the French troops (2–1/3 divisions and some air units)
                        have been committed to NATO command in time of crisis. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has said that this commitment
                        will end on July 1. The Germans maintain that commitment destroys the legal
                        basis for keeping French troops on German soil. <hi rend="italic">Whatever
                            the legal case, French presence without a new agreement is unacceptable
                            as a matter of German politics—it would smell of occupation</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Germans—with our full support—have told the French that their troops are
                        welcome to stay “provided a new agreement is reached regarding their mission
                        and their commitment to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> command in
                        time of conflict.” This condition is subject to several interpretations—the
                        key is what we mean by “commitment” and whether we really mean <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> command (as opposed to some
                        face-saving, common but two-hat command arrangement).</p>
                    <p>The joint U.S./UK/German negotiating paper (which is now in the hands of the
                        Fourteen) takes a tough initial line—insisting that the French publicly
                        undertake a commitment to assign these troops to NATO when those members of
                        the Alliance with troops in Germany agree that a state of emergency exists.
                        He is thus asked to give up a veto which he now holds as a full member of
                        NATO and to undertake a commitment formally tougher than, for example, ours.
                        On the other hand, the question is posed because of the unilateral actions
                        he has taken.</p>
                    <p>Nobody thinks <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will agree to
                        this; it is meant as an opening tactic from which we are willing to retreat.
                        The question is how and when. (The “when” is critical because it was agreed
                        between <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and the Germans in
                        Bonn that a new German-French agreement must be under negotiation by July 1,
                        or the French must begin withdrawing their troops.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The outlines of a reasonable fall-back position are fairly
                            clear</hi>. We would ask <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> to commit France:</p>
                    <p>(1) to a meaningful military mission for the two divisions;</p>
                    <p>(2) to join in peacetime planning and joint maneuvers;</p>
                    <p>(3) to place her forces under common command in time of crisis;</p>
                    <p>(4) to reaffirm Article V of the Treaty (the mutual security provision)
                        without any qualification.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">ball</persName> is now in the French court.
                        Our intelligence indicates that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> will ignore our maximum conditions and inform the
                        Germans he <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0419"/>will remove his troops
                        by July 1, 1967. He will try to blame the Germans—and us—for not making an
                        agreement, and strengthen rising domestic pressures on <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to soften his line.</p>
                    <p>Whatever he does, we must avoid being subject to the charge that we presented
                        impossible conditions to the French and that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s negative response is justified. It must be
                        understood that our initial offer is just that. The operational questions
                        are:</p>
                    <p>—whether we let a confrontation build in this matter between now and July 1;
                        or</p>
                    <p>—whether we indicate to the French that we could live with something short of
                        the initial proposal;</p>
                    <p>—and, if so, by what route we put on the record that our proposal was not a
                        final proposal, and that it is <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> (and not the Germans, U.S., UK) who is being
                        unreasonable.</p>
                    <p>Operationally, we must await the French reply and then consult closely the
                        Germans and others.</p>
                    <p rend="center">5. Whether to send the aide-memoire</p>
                    <p>The aide-memoire is a formal list of sharply stated specific questions and
                        legal positions having to do with overflights, wartime re-entry, use of our
                        oil pipeline across France, etc. <hi rend="italic">The issue is not whether
                            these questions get asked, but how</hi>—whether we ask them in a formal
                        aide-memoire, which will be in the papers the next day, or through private
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                        conversations based on an informal list of questions.</p>
                    <p>The status of these defense issues varies. On overflights, we may be able to
                        strike a straightforward bargain: overflights in return for continued French
                        access to NATO air defense information and air space. The pipeline issue is
                        tougher (and is discussed in detail in the aide-memoire). However we handle
                        it, we will probably want to make our own separate alternative arrangements.
                        The question of access to French facilities in wartime is also cloudy, but
                        probably worth trying to negotiate. (In each case—and whatever bargain we
                        strike—our military planning will have to be hedged for the possibility that
                        the French will not perform.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The issue of whether to send the aide-memoire comes down
                            to whether we want another public show of our legal position or a quiet
                            clarification</hi>—knowing throughout that we are unlikely to be
                        satisfied whichever tack we take. The two of us would vote for the quiet
                        approach; but before making up your mind, you should hear the case for the

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>.</p>

                    <p>After going through these papers and hearing the arguments, you will wish to

                    <p>We would suggest that, in a <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, et
                        al, meeting, you make clear that:</p>
                    <p>(1) in our public position you want to minimize any suggestion of a direct
                        Washington/Paris confrontation;</p>
                    <p>(2) if public exposition of our differences is required, it should be in
                        terms of an integrated military alliance versus bilateralism or
                        fragmentation of the West;</p>
                    <p>(3) you do not wish the U.S. to be in a position of begging anything of the
                        French;</p>
                    <p>(4) we should proceed with the Allies to plan the prompt movement of people
                        and equipment out of France;</p>
                    <p>(5) on French troops in Germany, you wish us to be exactly as sturdy as
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, but we should not push him
                        into positions that are costly in terms of his domestic politics unless he
                        is pressured by his Gaullists into positions which would endanger the
                        security of our troops, or the integrity of NATO command arrangements;</p>
                    <p>(6) with respect to Allied overflights and French access to Allied
                        communications and intelligence, we should indicate our hope that both can
                        be maintained; but our planning should be based on the possibility that we
                        shall have to operate without overflights; we should make clear to the
                        French that we regard these two as an inextricable package;</p>
                    <p>(7) with respect to the NATO oil pipeline, we should plan for a capability
                        sufficient to help defend Western Europe without reliance on the French,
                        while seeing what we can negotiate after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s return from Moscow;</p>
                    <p>(8) without public acknowledgment, our plans and actions should convey that
                        we are moving to maintain an effective collective defense without France,
                        while trying to make fair and even-handed arrangements to keep France in a
                        close working relationship with the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Our willingness to do without the French—and our actions which indicate our
                        preparedness to do without them—constitute our best negotiating cards, given
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s sensitivity to
                        “isolation”; but in fact as well as in posture there is enough ambiguity in
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s commitment so that it
                        would be imprudent to be dependent on France, during his time, in a period

                        of his draft aide-memoire to the French;<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d165fn4">footnote 4, Document 165</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George</persName> will propose the text of a
                        letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> to be
                        delivered prior to the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit to
                        London on Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">A copy of this draft, which is

                    </p>
                    <p>We reported to the President at 6 p.m. in the Cabinet Room. Those present
                        were Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, Moyers, <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName>, Rostow.</p>
                    <p>The first matter considered was the proposed letter to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName>; the import of it was to warn
                        the PM not to be too exacting in his attitude toward the Germans next week,
                        and to avoid freezing policy on the nuclear sharing issue. It was decided to
                        amplify the message in a redraft, but the President approved the underlying
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>Next, Dean Acheson was asked to comment on his memorandum concerning matters
                        that might be raised in negotiations with France over NATO.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">

                        <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> felt the most important ones
                        were: (1) The presence of French troops in Germany; (2) Allied overflights
                        through French air space; (3) Continued transportation of oil across France;
                        (4) Reentry rights into facilities in France in case of war. The termination
                        of valid bilateral agreements between the United States and France,
                        denounced unilaterally by France, concerned us but was not an alliance
                        affair.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> believes there is probably not
                        much to be gained substantively in negotiating these items, but we should at
                        least go through the motions, and establish a record.</p>
                    <p>Consideration of this paper spilled over into discussion of a draft
                        aide-memoire suggested as an answer to that of the French Government sent us
                        on April 22, 1966. The President must have been primed in advance to object
                        to it, for his first comment was he wanted nothing of this sort committed to
                        writing, since he would find it reproduced in the New York Times, and
                        elsewhere, before its delivery in Paris. This led him into what seemed to me
                        a wholly intemperate attack on United States officials who had assailed
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for his NATO
                        stance. I <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0422"/>confess I was not
                        sufficiently familiar with what Max Frankel, Ben Welles, and other
                        journalists cited by him have written to judge whether there was any real
                        basis for LBJ's criticism of officials' speeches and testimony before
                        Congressional Committees. I do, however, believe LBJ's hypersensitivity to
                        newspaper gossip is disturbing, unwise, and undignified.</p>
                    <p>It is never difficult to ignite the Acheson powder magazine, and the
                        President's spark set off an explosion. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> said he resented the President's inferences about his
                        own statements, as well as what he had said about <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> was furious, so was the President. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked whether LBJ had ever read
                            <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George</persName>'s speech to which he had
                        referred as injudiciously attacking the General.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s April 29
                            speech, see Department of State Bulletin, May 16, 1966, pp.
                            762–768.</note> The President said he had not, but his policy was that
                        no one in the Administration should contravene his orders about being
                        scrupulously polite in references to the General. The fat sizzled in the
                        fire for quite a time. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName> tried
                        diversionary tactics, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        finally intervened effectively with a discourse on military complications in
                        NATO. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> visibly seethed in
                        silence; LBJ looked like a human thundercloud. It was an unpleasant
                        experience. Eventually, the question posed by the paper was resolved by
                        compromise; <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will talk about it
                        with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> at Brussels in
                        early June.</p>
                    <p>I responded to a Presidential inquiry with reflections on what I thought were
                        the cardinal problems raised by the French defection from NATO.</p>

                    <p>The President said he was delighted to welcome the Foreign Minister to the
                        United States. He hoped he could reciprocate the hospitality which he had
                        received in Belgium.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2"> JOHNSON visited Belgium in
                            November 1963.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that it was a great privilege for him to salute the
                        President on behalf of his country and he was greatly appreciative that the
                        President had found it possible to receive him. He noted that he had had
                        useful conversations with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Ball</hi> and other officials,
                        which were very important in view of the preparations for the NATO
                        Ministerial meeting to be held in Brussels in June.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">A summary of these conversations was transmitted to the
                            NATO capitals in circular telegram 2297, May 23. (Department of State,
                            Central Files, POL 7 BER)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister continued that he attached great importance to the
                        President's declaration of May 3 concerning relations with Europe.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">For text of Johnson's statement on May 3, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>,
                                1966</hi>, Book I, pp. 475–478.</note> He believed that an
                        integrated defense has been essential in the past and will remain so for the
                        future. He hoped that it would be possible to have an integrated defense
                        among the 15 partners of NATO, and he wished to stress the number 15.
                        However, if this proved to be impossible, then the remaining 14 should
                        continue to adhere to the concept of integration. The Alliance should be
                        organized so as to be effective in an operational sense; if it were not, it
                        would be simply a paper alliance and it might be better not to have it.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that another thought expressed by the President on
                        May 3, which was very close to the views of Belgium, was that the moment has
                        come to develop, within as well as outside of the Alliance, humanitarian and
                        cultural ties between Eastern and Western Europe. He was very happy to know
                        that the President was thinking along these lines.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that he concurred heartily with what the Foreign
                        Minister had said, and he welcomed the opportunity to reiterate his interest
                        and deep concern regarding all developments in Europe. The President was
                        glad that the Foreign Minister had such strong feelings about the necessity
                        for the Allies to remain united on the basis of the 15 <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0424"/>members, if possible, or of the 14 members
                        in any case. The President hoped that the forthcoming Ministerial meeting in
                        Brussels would be a fruitful one, and he knew that the Foreign Minister
                        would play a leading role in its deliberations. The President emphasized the
                        need in this critical stage for complete understanding and unity among the
                        Allies.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he believed it was bad manners to speak harshly of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or engage in an
                        acrimonious exchange with him. However, this should not be construed by
                        anyone as a lack of concern on his part with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s policies. This had been expressed in many ways and
                        the American people today feel more strongly than ever about the need for
                        unity.</p>
                    <p>The President deeply regretted the divisions and difficulties in the
                        Alliance. We should not brood about these, however, and it was good that the
                        14 wished to join together in adversity. He hoped that a strengthening of
                        the Alliance would result from the June meeting.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to the Foreign Minister's thoughts concerning
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s forthcoming visit to
                        Moscow. He, himself, did not know what would come of it, although he doubted
                        if the 14 would get much solace from the visit. The Foreign Minister replied
                        that he had asked a number of European statesmen about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s motivations, but in vain. We
                        shall see what happens. But in any case, he did not believe that external
                        events should govern our acts in the Alliance. He felt it was our duty to
                        solidify the Alliance and to seize the opportunity of the Brussels meeting
                        for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's inquiry as to his views concerning the
                        question of French troops in Germany, the Foreign Minister said that the
                        matter had been posed by the German note in very precise terms, but the
                        recent French reply seemed to evade a response.<note n="5" xml:id="d167fn5">For texts of the May 3 German note, and the May 18 French reply, see
                                <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1966</hi>, pp. 340–343.</note> He thought that the matter should be
                        clearer by the time of the meeting in Brussels. The Foreign Minister
                        commented that he would prefer to take up the problem of the Alliance in its
                        entirety rather than focus on the presence or absence of French troops in
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Foreign Minister's views regarding the relocation of
                            <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and the North Atlantic Council
                        and wondered what popular and political reactions might be if these
                        installations were located in Belgium.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded that it would be well to consider the problem
                        in the context of the overall situation of the Alliance. Moreover, before
                        giving its answer, Belgium would wish to be assured that the other Allies
                        were united in their views. He thought this could be confirmed <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0425"/>at Brussels. In any case, his own belief
                        was that the political and military organs of the Alliance should not be
                        separated but should be located close together as they had been in France.
                        This should hold true regardless of the country of location.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister noted that he understood from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, the Secretary General of the Council, that the
                        Council was now looking in the direction of Benelux for a relocation site.
                        It would be necessary for the Benelux countries to consider the technical as
                        well as the political ramifications and this was already under way. Although
                        the Benelux study had not been completed, the Foreign Minister could say
                        that his view was that, if it appears it is the duty of the Benelux to
                        accept the NATO installations, he could not see how the Benelux could fail
                        to fulfill such a duty.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said the first results of the investigation into the
                        reaction of public opinion in Belgium to the possibility of relocating the
                        NATO installations in Belgium had been positive. So far as the political
                        side is concerned, the Foreign Minister had consulted with the leaders of
                        the majority and minority parties just before coming to the United States
                        and their initial reactions had not been unfavorable.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister noted that he had agreed to consult his Benelux
                        colleagues before taking further action on this matter and he asked that the
                        friends of Belgium “trust her” for the few remaining weeks prior to the
                        Brussels meeting. He stressed that he did not wish to receive an official
                        bid concerning the relocation of NATO installations before the Brussels
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the President once again mentioned his high regard for the
                        Foreign Minister's leadership. He said that he was dedicated to the
                        preservation of peace and the security of the Alliance and he hoped that
                        progress could be made at the Brussels meeting. He appreciated very much the
                        Belgian attitude of cooperation and support, which was so important in the
                        present difficult times.</p>

                    <p>I have given further thought and study to the problems posed for us by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s decisions and I
                        hope to send you my thoughts on these matters in the near future. Meanwhile,

                            16–17 primarily to work on a draft aide-memoire that the NATO Allies

                            telegram 2258, May 18. (Ibid., Central Files, DEF 4 NATO)</note> and I
                        think we are in basic agreement as to how to proceed.</p>
                    <p>As you may have noted in my talk on the occasion of the Polish
                            millennium,<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">See <ref target="#d167fn4">footnote 4, Document 167</ref>.</note> I share your view that we
                        should actively explore possibilities for the east from our Atlantic
                        base.</p>
                    <p>I know Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> will be
                        visiting you next week, and your talks can be very important: taking account
                        of the comments in your letter of March 29,<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">
                            <ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> I would like to make
                        several points that may be relevant to those talks.</p>
                    <p>The heart of the matter is this: so long as France and Germany were working
                        closely together to build an integrated Europe there was some assurance of
                        stability in German policy and attitudes. Now that France is no longer
                        taking part in this joint effort—and, indeed, placing heavy pressure on
                        German political life—there is grave danger that the Germans will over time
                        feel that they have been cast adrift. A growing sense of uncertainty and
                        insecurity on their part could lead to a fragmentation of European and
                        Atlantic relations which would be tragic for all of us.</p>
                    <p>On our part, we cannot risk the danger of a rudderless Germany in the heart
                        of Europe.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, any exaggerated bilateral relationship between the United
                        States and Germany offers many disadvantages.</p>
                    <p>I believe, therefore, that it is imperative for our three countries to stay
                        as close as possible to each other. On that basis Europe and the Atlantic
                        world can be rallied.</p>
                    <p>Such a relationship will be healthy and lasting only if it is based on the
                        concept of German equality with the other major European countries. <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0427"/>We have seen before an attempt to
                        keep Germany in second class status. It failed then and it would fail
                        again.</p>
                    <p>In this circumstance, we should make a special effort to maintain the closest
                        unity of action with the Germans during the coming months of tension.</p>
                    <p>I am sure, therefore, that it would not serve our common interests now to try
                        to press the Chancellor to accept a nuclear solution that he might consider
                        at variance with the concept of equality.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the United States did not invent the nuclear issue. We have
                        simply tried to respond to concerns expressed by others.</p>
                    <p>These concerns first became evident when, in December 1957 the NATO heads of
                        government agreed that missiles of strategic range should be placed at the
                        disposal of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Both your government and mine saw serious disadvantages in national
                        land-based deployment of these missiles. That is why the proposal for a
                        joint sea-based force was first developed. The British Government stated in
                        December 1962 that they would “use their best endeavours” in closest
                        consultation with our NATO allies to develop a multilateral sea-based
                        force.</p>
                    <p>In December 1964 you put forward the alternative proposal for an Atlantic
                        nuclear force. I agreed that this should be fairly and fully discussed among
                        the interested countries. We used our best efforts to guide German thinking
                        along this line. A year later Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> gave a memorandum reflecting German views which went
                        a long way to meet your proposals.<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">See <ref target="#d119fn3">footnote 3, Document 119</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Against this background, it seems important that we not leave the Germans
                        under the impression that we have shifted our views just when they were
                        moving towards us or that we do not take the Chancellor's proposal
                        seriously.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean at all that I am wedded to any particular solution to this
                        problem. We are doing staff work over the whole range of options. We should
                        not foreclose any of them. I hope this will also be your view and that none
                        of our three governments will freeze its position until we all discuss this
                        question more fully.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that what is at stake in all of this is a political question
                        of the deepest moment: Germany's relations with the West. In the context of
                        the present crisis, the pressures on the Germans it has already generated,
                        and the likelihood that those pressures will increase as French diplomatic
                        maneuvers add further confusion, we must all keep together.</p>
                    <p>In the long pull, I am sure that the one best hope of stability and peace
                        lies in the inclusion of Germany in a larger European unity, in <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0428"/>which any latent nationalistic drives can
                        be submerged. I am sure, also, that you and your country hold the key to
                        this possibility and that you can play a role of great leadership in Europe.
                        When all is said and done, no one has come up with a better formula than
                        that of European unity and Atlantic partnership, and I doubt that anyone
                        will.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>I have been giving consideration to what we might most usefully attempt to
                        accomplish in the forthcoming NATO Ministerial Meeting at Brussels.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">On May 21, the Department of State transmitted to

                            The positions outlined here are the same as those transmitted on May 21.
                            (Circular telegram 2296; ibid.)</note> The fourteen Ministers will, of
                        course, be meeting separately on June 6 prior to the formal opening the next
                        day. We hope that it will be possible in this meeting to get some basic
                        decisions made on relocation of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> and hopefully on the types of
                        reorganization of NATO military structure which we might seek. I intend to
                        stress strongly the US desire to move the North Atlantic Council from Paris,
                        preferably to Brussels, due to our conviction that it must be collocated
                        with NATO's higher military direction. I hope that we can all do some
                        preliminary work on the few of our colleagues who still seem to be reluctant
                        to face <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0429"/>this issue, so that a
                        decision in principle can be made at Brussels. We have had extremely good
                        meetings with <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">George Thomson</persName> and
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> during the
                        course of this past week. I found the attitude of both a cause for
                        encouragement, and the aide-memoire produced by the British<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">See <ref target="#d168fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                168</ref>.</note> can be a useful vehicle for reaching decisions at
                        Brussels.</p>
                    <p>I would like in my own remarks at Brussels to stress the theme that NATO
                        should be developed further as an instrument for moving towards settlement
                        of East-West problems. As some observers have pointed out, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s challenge to NATO is, in one
                        important respect, based on the presumption that he, acting alone, can do
                        more to promote European detente than can NATO and that NATO in fact, in its
                        present form, is an obstacle to the promotion of more favorable East-West
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>I consider this a most dangerous view. As you know, I believe that it is only
                        by the Western nations acting in concert and by continuing to keep our
                        defenses credible that the conditions for ultimate solution of East-West
                        difficulties can be enhanced. We must, of course, be careful to combat the
                        impression that NATO is merely a military Alliance, that its hour of need
                        has passed and that defense of NATO is simply defense of the status quo.
                        Therefore, I think we should demonstrate publicly at Brussels that NATO has
                        an equal concern in moving towards improvement of relations with the East
                        and that NATO, as an organization, is seeking an expansion of its political
                        role in augmenting East-West contacts. I do not myself believe that there
                        are major opportunities close at hand for securing fundamental changes in
                        East-West relations or that the time is ripe for presenting basic new
                        proposals. It will continue to be a slow and gradual process, but we should
                        continue to work at it.</p>
                    <p>I feel quite keenly that one of our needs in the present crisis is to combat
                        impressions of 'immobilisme.' NATO, if it is to survive and flourish, must
                        demonstrate increasingly its capability to serve as a serious forum for the
                        consideration of new approaches to the problems which still beset our common

                    <p>2349. 1. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Jean Rey</persName> of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission, exuding optimism, concluded
                        useful Washington visit with general exchange views with Secretary and Under
                        Secretary. Following based on uncleared memo of conversation<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">Not found.</note> subject to change, and is <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> and Noforn.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> there should be no question
                        about changes in our policy and attitude toward Europe. We would welcome
                        unified Europe conveying sense of dynamic momentum and generating ideas for
                        facing future in close partnership with US. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out American voices are heard urging
                        abandonment support for European integration as dream which had not worked,
                        in favor of thesis that better policy would be detente from Atlantic to
                        Urals and acceptance of perpetuation of traditional role of national states.
                        Nevertheless, US continued to believe that most effective, most stable and
                        most promising American approach to Europe was support for unification
                        movement in which UK would play full role. He and Secretary asserted
                        overriding US interest lay in pursuit concept Western unity and not in
                        return to divisive nationalism of other days.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> expressed satisfaction with
                        these views and pointed out that <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis
                        had proven that Community idea was stronger than individual national states.
                        He noted crisis ended and France returned to Brussels when Five demonstrated
                        Treaty and Community would go on with or without France. He added that
                        recent agricultural financing decisions were most far-reaching steps in
                        integration process to date and that growing strength of Community was also
                        demonstrated by its power of attraction for <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> states, particularly UK where remarkable evolution in
                        Labor view had taken place.</p>
                    <p>4. In reply to Secretary's question as to whether <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and KR matters could be insulated from NATO crisis,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> remarked that Commission had
                        been concerned by this issue in March but that six governments were agreed
                        that effort should be made to keep matters separate. He said this had been
                        an issue in Germany where <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                        had argued that it politically impossible to agree on agricultural financing
                        involving large benefits for France at same time French were attacking NATO.
                        However, Erhard, on Schmuecker urging, had taken position that “temporary
                        NATO crisis” should not be allowed to endanger “permanent European <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0431"/>Community”. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> added that situation could of course
                        change if French went too far, for example during <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visit to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>5. Secretary asked if Commission and member governments understood time
                        pressures on KR and political importance of concluding negotiations well
                        before expiration <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss>. He said he regularly
                        stressed to other Foreign Ministers success was essential if US and Atlantic
                        nations were to sustain policies of trade liberalization. Failure would
                        raise major political questions. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>
                        assured Secretary that point was fully understood by all Community members
                        and said no one was disposed to challenge deadline for conclusion
                        negotiations by end February 1967. He expressed confidence that <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> decisions would be taken before end of July
                        which would permit conclusion of negotiations in six months of intensive
                        work beginning September 1.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> also told Secretary how
                        impressed he had been with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>'s exposition of US agricultural policies. While
                        there had been doubt in Europe about US policy towards agriculture in KR,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> had correctly pointed out
                        situation in which US giving massive food aid to <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s while others, including <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, closed commercial markets would be impossible. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>'s clear statement would be most useful to Commission
                        in upcoming agricultural ministerial discussions of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> grains proposals. Secretary emphasized that if peace
                        preserved world food problem would be most important single preoccupation of
                        coming years and that it was essential Europeans also pitch in since neither
                        US nor <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s could fill gap by themselves.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> also expressed satisfaction with
                        indications that movement to reconcile Western differences over trade
                        preferences is developing, mentioning abandonment of Brasseur Plan by
                        Europeans and hints that US in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> was
                        adopting more flexible position. Under Secretary said it seemed to him
                        perfectly possible that over time common position on preference problems
                        could emerge. Excepting special Nigeria case, he thought regional preference
                        systems were eroding and he sensed that general view was developing that to
                        extent preferences were desirable at all, they should be non-discriminatory.
                        While <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> cited need for common
                        position before <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> II, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was noncommittal on timing of any
                        eventual agreement.</p>
                    <p>8. Details of conversations with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and others on KR issues will be reported
                        separately.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This paper responds to the nuclear portion of NSAM 345.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">
                            <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> A later paper will deal
                        with other aspects.</p>
                    <p>We propose, as a first step, tripartite talks in Washington between the U.S.,
                        British and German foreign and defense ministers to narrow differences and,
                        if possible, determine a program each will support.</p>
                    <p>Such discussions will take place in a climate set by the French crisis in
                        NATO, and by the increasing grasp of the realities of nuclear warfare
                        resulting from Working Group III consultations.</p>
                    <p>In the February meeting, Working Group III agreed that sufficient strategic
                        forces exist for deterrence, but that if used they cannot protect NATO
                        countries from unacceptable damage. In the April meeting, the Working Group
                        agreed that enough tactical weapons are on hand, that tactical nuclear war
                        in NATO Europe requires more study and planning, and, most significantly,
                        that it is “difficult to predict whether it would be of net advantage to
                        NATO to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in aggression less than general
                        war in Allied Command Europe.”</p>
                    <p>This is the first real allied appreciation of the problems associated with
                        the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Further study will reveal to the Working Group the gaping holes in all
                        strategic options.</p>
                    <p>1. The threat of instant and massive retaliation is a deterrent, but in
                        execution may be virtually suicidal.</p>
                    <p>2. The conventional defense—that is, a non-nuclear defense adequate to
                        require an enemy to mount so substantial an attack as to assume the onus of
                        nuclear war—by reason of recent events, seems less attainable than
                        heretofore.</p>
                    <p>3. Tactical nuclear war, as Working Group III concluded, is full of
                        uncertainties. Further study may produce elements which both <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0433"/>strengthen defense and remain controllable,
                        such as nuclear demolition defenses, air defenses, and antisubmarine
                        tactics, used in friendly territory or at sea. Other similar tactical
                        nuclear plateaus may emerge. All such measures, however, have obvious limits
                        of effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>4. The war at sea, based on naval blockade, is feasible and has political
                        leverage, but cannot in itself apply sufficient pressure to stop land
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, in time, a coherent strategy can be built on some combination of the
                        conventional defense, tactical nuclear weapons, and the war at sea.</p>
                    <p>The combination of the NATO-France crisis, and the developing realization of
                        the strategic uncertainties listed above, raises the possibility of
                        allied—and particularly German—concerns during NATO negotiations with the
                        French and during the course of the Working Group studies. It is important,
                        therefore, to develop now as comforting a common goal as possible, and to
                        produce a sense of movement toward it. This is the primary purpose of the
                        measures proposed in this paper.</p>
                    <p>The enclosures outline: (1) NATO nuclear consultation measures without a NATO
                        Nuclear Force, and (2) alternative possibilities for a NATO Nuclear
                            Force.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">Neither printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Neither contemplates initial French participation, but could provide for
                        France to join when and if she wished.</p>
                    <p>We hope for a Presidential decision authorizing discussions with the British
                        and German ministers, and an indication from the President of what proposals
                        the U.S. representative may put forward at such a conference.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In the hopes that it might be useful to you in connection with the Brussels
                        discussion, I am giving you here a very stark outline—perhaps a little too
                        stark for telegraphic reporting—of what I believe de Gaulle generally has in
                        mind. Bits of this have already been reported, but I am trying to set it
                        forth in simple outline.</p>
                    <p>As you know, any analysis of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        requires a great deal of guessing, and the only thing you can hope for is
                        that it is knowledgeable and reasonably intelligent. The following summation
                        is based upon everything I have been able to find out, both by reading and
                        talking, around here about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s policies.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is in a hurry because he
                        realizes that he has not many more years of activity as President of France
                        and therefore is telescoping, perhaps dangerously, some of the stages of a
                        policy which I think he has had in mind for years and years. From his
                        writing it is apparent that he always envisaged the emergence of Europe
                        after the war as a third power center in the world to match the United
                        States and the Soviet Union. He considers that the two military blocs, NATO
                        and the Warsaw Pact, at best were conceived under different circumstances,
                        were at worst even in error at the time of their creation. He obviously
                        takes in his public utterances the former position, but his purpose now it
                        seems to me very clearly is a desire to destroy the “ideological blocs”,
                        whatever cause may have been their coming into existence, because they now
                        constitute one of the obstacles to the creation of Europe as a whole.</p>
                    <p>He had started this process by proceeding against the organization for I
                        believe tactical, political reasons, since it has been advantageous to him
                        domestically to present France as faithful to the alliance although
                        withdrawing from the organization. I do not believe we should be for a
                        minute fooled by this attempt to carry water on both shoulders. In the first
                        place, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in his letter to the
                        President has seriously modified French obligations to Article V through the
                        use of the “unprovoked” aggression formula.</p>
                    <p>Also, as you know, we have reported information from a reliable source that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s original intention
                        was to denounce the treaty but was dissuaded from this step by Pompidou
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Georges Pompidou, French Prime
                            Minister.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName>. <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0435"/>There is a
                        high degree of probability that after the elections in March, particularly
                        if they turn out as he hopes, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> will go further and announce his determination to
                        withdraw from the treaty in 1969. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> obviously hopes that the example he has set in regard
                        to NATO will over a number of years be followed by similar actions in regard
                        to the Warsaw Pact, although he must realize that the control in this
                        instance lies completely in the hands of the Russians and that the Romanian
                        frolics do not really have much effect on the military situation of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>The real danger in my view of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s policy is its effect on Germany. As you know better
                        than I do, the Germans are [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>] sensitive to shifts or changes in Western
                        attitude, and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s anti-German
                        line and wooing of the Soviets has certainly not passed unnoticed in Bonn.
                        It seems to me therefore that the real ultimate danger of his policy, if
                        consistently pursued, would lie theoretically in the possibility of
                        provoking another Soviet-German deal. If the Germans became discouraged by
                        the attitude of Western support, and I must mention here my doubts as to the
                        line used in NATO for East/West “detente”, and became convinced that
                        everybody was rushing to ingratiate themselves with Russia, it would not be
                        too long in my opinion before some [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] German nationalist of the type of
                            Strauss<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Franz-Josef Strauss</persName>, former West

                        footwork with Moscow. I am sure you will agree that one of the cardinal
                        principles of Soviet foreign policy has always been the advantages to the
                        Soviet Union of an arrangement with Germany.</p>
                    <p>However, on the other side I must likewise state my conviction that it lies
                        within the power of the U.S. and our allies to prevent <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s policy from coming into
                        fruition. It is very doubtful if he will get much satisfaction from Moscow,
                        and given the nature of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> he
                        might do another switch and begin to pursue a more anti-Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>The great fallacy in my opinion of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s policy is his belief that France is important in
                        Soviet eyes. This of course is not true and I would see no problem for the
                        Russians in ditching <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for
                        the sake of an agreement either with Germany or the United States.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will excuse my putting this down for you, but as I say I thought
                        it might conceivably be helpful. As you see, it involves a good deal of
                        speculation, and I would prefer to do it in this form.</p>

                        ATLANTIC COMMUNITY</p>
                    <p>This paper responds to that part of NSAM 345 which directs the development of
                        proposals to increase the cohesion of NATO and the North Atlantic
                        community.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Introduction</p>
                    <p>The most dangerous ultimate outcome of the disintegrating forces set in
                        motion by French secession from NATO would be a similar shift of Germany
                        from integration with the West to political and military unilateralism.
                        Measures designed to deal with the French defection should therefore aim at
                        or be consistent with enhanced German integration in NATO and the West; they
                        should prove the worth of NATO, especially to the Germans, and strengthen
                        the cooperative relations within and through the organization.</p>
                    <p>While the European Community is not the subject of this memorandum, its
                        existence as a vital constructive force in Europe and its future prospects
                        are closely related to the goals of this memorandum—particularly the
                        maintenance of an institutional framework within which Germany can live. The
                        Common Market has withstood <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s assaults. In time England will surely become a part of
                        this Community. In the meantime, while we defend and strengthen NATO we must
                        also give continuing U.S. support to the European Community and the cause of
                        a united Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p> NATO's Principal Political Function—Preparation for Settlement in Central
                        Europe</p>
                    <p>Since NATO military forces and U.S. nuclear support have greatly lessened the
                        threat of military attack, NATO's cohesion will rest quite as much on its
                        political basis. In short, NATO is not merely a military structure to
                        prepare a collective defense against military aggression, but also a
                        political organization to preserve the peace of Europe. More specifically,
                            <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0437"/>as long as the German problem
                        remains the chief danger point, the basic political function of the alliance
                        is the collective management of the German-Soviet relationship in the
                        unsettled Central European setting that emerged from World War II. In this
                        function the Federal Republic should participate as a confederate, and not a
                        ward, of the other allies. A multilateral system of military integration in
                        peacetime, embodying the whole of the German military forces, is a
                        prerequisite for exercising this function.</p>
                    <p>Emphasizing, clarifying, and implementing NATO's political function is
                        central to its cohesion during the present strains. The first step is to
                        bring home to the NATO allies the need for an agreed NATO policy regarding
                        the division of Europe and the division of Germany. Europe is full of
                        demands for a political initiative, for not leaving the field of East-West
                        relations to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, for a
                        detente with Eastern Europe. But there is very little understanding that all
                        this is meaningless unless action stems from an agreed policy for healing
                        the division of Europe and Germany on a sound, equal, and lasting basis.</p>
                    <p>The object of policy should not be to devise a settlement. Fifteen years of
                        meetings have proved that impossible. The object should be common action to
                        improve the environment which could make discussion of settlement meaningful
                        and not merely a move in a propaganda war. This suggests a look at the
                        existing environment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1) Present Situation in Eastern Europe and Soviet
                        Union</p>
                    <p>The last ten years have been a period of change. But academic experts and
                        governmental officials agree that the Eastern European countries are still
                        Communist regimes, wedded to their political theology, unwilling to lose
                        political control, and facing serious economic difficulties. These countries
                        are filled with suspicion not only of the West but of one another. Thus,
                        while undeniably there has been change, it is significant more in terms of
                        what previously existed than in comparison with change in any of the Western
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Then there is the special problem of East Germany. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has the highest standard of living of any
                        of the Eastern European states. It is the Soviet Union's most important
                        trading partner and supplies advanced industrial exports. The twenty Soviet
                        divisions in East Germany, and their line of supply across Poland, are the
                        keystone of Soviet political and military hegemony over Eastern Europe. In a
                        word, the status quo in East Germany is a vital national interest of the
                        USSR. An active U.S. and Western European policy towards Eastern Europe has
                        both limitations and traps.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) Cautions Regarding Approach</p>
                    <p>Approach to this complicated problem requires realistic appreciation within
                        the United States and among our Allies of the probabilities <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0438"/>and tempo of change in attitude of the East
                        and, more particularly, of the narrow limits of change imposed by the facts
                        of the situation.</p>
                    <p>In Eastern Europe certain individuals and groups are cautiously trying to
                        loosen dictatorial controls, while each of the states is attempting with
                        varying degrees of success to lessen dependence on the Soviet Union. Western
                        fanfare or the spotlight of public approval turned on these individuals and
                        groups, rather than helping them, is more likely to end their efforts.
                        Furthermore, a more liberal Western policy ought not to be identified too
                        closely with NATO. The NAT is a military treaty. A more flexible Western
                        policy will be vulnerable to Soviet attack and Eastern European suspicion if
                        this policy and NATO are tied together.</p>
                    <p>At every stage in policy making and execution scrupulous attention must be
                        paid to German interests and sensitivities. The Germans will be difficult,
                        at times irrational, and slow to move. They are, after all, in the difficult
                        position of being under attack by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and feared by their weaker Western neighbors. To be
                        insensitive to German views, or to override them, would sacrifice a vital
                        Western interest. As we have seen in the past, many of the Western nations
                        (particularly the Scandinavians and the British) fail to see the
                        intransigence of the East, look upon the Germans as the obstacle, and often
                        seek solutions at the expense of German interests.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the dangers that detente will become the current foreign policy fad
                        are considerable. To our allies it could be, at the beginning, an excuse for
                        even more inadequate defense contributions, and, ultimately, a bitter and
                        disillusioning let down. To the Soviet Union and the Eastern European states
                        it might appear as a more suave attempt at “roll back” by dividing and
                        weakening our opponents. This would be a misfortune since it would defeat
                        the purpose of the policy and open us to an effective propaganda charge that
                        the U.S. lags behind its allies in opening peaceful intercourse across the
                        division in Europe.</p>

                        They obviously vary in importance and merit. Their importance, after they
                        have been culled over, may be, first, in the cumulative effect upon our NATO
                        allies, and especially upon the Germans, as an earnest of an attempt to work
                        seriously upon the Central European and German problem. This may help to
                        offset the disruptive effect in Germany of the French attitude following the
                        Moscow visit. The more long-term effect may be in creating a better
                        environment for a step-by-step approach to ending the division of
                        Europe.</p>

                    <p>Secto 54. Eyes only for the President. We have had our first and crucial day
                        with the 14 and I am happy to report that “the family of 14” remains
                        together. <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Paul Martin</persName>, looking over
                        his shoulder at Quebec, was our most difficult problem. But we succeeded in
                        reaching decision on relocation of NATO military headquarters to Benelux,
                        subject to Belgium's necessity to take it up with their Parliament before a
                        final decision was concluded. But Belgium promises a “large majority” in the
                        Parliament on this issue. On the possible transfer of the North Atlantic
                        Council out of Paris, we indicated that that question would be finally
                        decided on the basis of the interests of NATO itself. If in the weeks and
                        months ahead during a series of negotiations with the French, and after
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s visit to Moscow, they
                        want to turn toward more cooperation, we have some leeway. On the other
                        hand, continued difficulty on their part will mean that the others will
                        insist upon moving <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> out of Paris. Exact

                        delegation is reporting several successive chapters in the story of
                        negotiations among the Fourteen and with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve
                            de Murville</persName> on arrangements for negotiating the issue of
                        French forces in Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">The four chapters were
                            transmitted in Secto 88, 90, 91, and 95, June 8. (Ibid., DEF 6
                            FR)</note> The significant developments are these:</p>
                    <p>1. The Fourteen stuck together past the point of breaking with the French on
                        a fundamental issue of substance, disguised as an issue of procedure.</p>
                    <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0441"/>
                    <p>2. After <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had tested their
                        ability to stay together, and found they really were prepared to break on
                        the issue of NATO cooperation and command arrangements for the French forces
                        in Germany, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> retreated to the
                        extent necessary to get a procedural agreement at this conference. This
                        object lesson in dealing with French diplomacy is similar to the lesson
                        learned from the Common Market negotiations of last winter.</p>
                    <p>3. In the process, <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> made what
                        I believe is the flattest and least equivocal statement of the limits of
                        German interest in an arrangement with the French on their troops in
                        Germany. The essence of the matter as <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> sees it is that if German troops must be
                        integrated into NATO, the French troops have to have some formal
                        relationship to the NATO system, else the discrimination against Germany on
                        its own soil is just too big for any German Government to swallow.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Paul Martin</persName> of Canada continues to
                        be the most difficult of my colleagues on all dealings with the French. On
                        the issue of moving <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> out of Paris, he
                        urged Couve to make clear in the Ministerial Council that France wants
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to stay in Paris. (<persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> did not go as far in doing so as
                            <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> wanted him to.) On the
                        French forces in Germany, <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> again
                        showed signs of being more Royalist than the King. Although <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> has sporadic support from Danes,
                        Italians, and even Belgians, the issues with those others are probably well
                        within our negotiating range. <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName>'s
                        view is a very special case, with which the professionals in his own
                        delegation seem unhappy. This may require some special bilateral attention
                        in the weeks to come.</p>
                    <p>5. At this point, my guess is that we will only be able to get a satisfactory
                        arrangement on French troops in Germany by playing a very tough diplomatic
                        game, keeping the Fourteen tied together through intimate and continuous
                        consultation, and making it very clear that we (together with the Germans
                        and the British) are prepared to face the prospect that the French might end
                        by pulling their forces out of Germany. This is not because we ourselves
                        want this result; but the issue is not one on which the French should be
                        enabled to break up NATO. Much additional evidence has come out of this
                        meeting that France is seeking a position which will permit her to stand
                        aside in a crisis.</p>

                        evaluate the prospects for both the bilateral and multilateral negotiations
                        with France?” He did not wish the bilateral German-French negotiations to
                        occupy the center of the total negotiation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that France has
                        posed for the NATO a far-reaching problem. They have not attempted to look
                        into the future in order to improve NATO—instead they have retreated 100
                        years to policies which have in the past led to disaster. We will be dealing
                        with the French on many issues ranging from French troops in Germany to the
                        continued use of the NATO pipeline in France. The question he wished to
                        raise with the Chancellor is, “Why <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> does what he does. We know what he does, but why?” If
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is deeply dissatisfied
                        with the present situation, serious problems lie ahead for us. Does the
                        Chancellor have any thoughts on this?</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        talks of Europe—however, he considers the Europe of the six to be useful
                        only in its economic and financial significance—not in any political sense.
                        Moreover, he does not consider these or the remaining countries of Europe,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                        <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0443"/>countries, in terms of any European
                        confederation. He seeks only a Europe under French hegemony. He has in the
                        past tried to persuade Germany to join in forming such a Europe. However,
                        Germany considers that this would be an act of treason against Europe. It is
                        clear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wants to get the
                        U.S., at least U.S. influence, out of Europe. He will seek in Moscow a
                        protectorate of the Soviet Union and France over Germany.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> rejoined that the U.S.
                        considers itself European—indeed, more European than most Russians. He
                        considers that the 14 have in Brussels agreed to “continue what we need to
                        do.” France is not an important world power—in Europe it ranks fifth, fourth
                        and third, respectively, in population, wealth and military forces. France
                        is not in fact important enough to force the future of the 450 million
                        people of the Atlantic area to its will. Let <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> react as he chooses. He must not interfere with our
                        getting the job done.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> agreed, but said that he was
                        anxious not to see Franco-German friendship shattered. Germany must live
                        with France. What did the U.S. people think about the importance of
                        France?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that in a recent
                        poll in America 76 percent of the people were for NATO, 6 percent against;
                        74 percent were against <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        policy, 6 percent for. This illustrates the attitude of our people towards
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and NATO. What
                        concerned him was that through the division of NATO we are missing an
                        opportunity to take advantage of the widespread disarray now existing in the
                        Communist world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that this was exactly
                        the German attitude. The question is: Should we come to terms with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or not? The U.S. and U.K. are,
                        for example, not interested in the terms granted the French for the
                        stationing of their troops in Germany, since both have troops here on the
                        same basis. Would the U.S. and the U.K. put up with France being given a
                        favored position? (The Chancellor appeared to be asking this question half
                        seriously—half rhetorically.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he could tell the Chancellor in great confidence
                        that French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName> had told him yesterday in Brussels that the French
                        Air Forces will be withdrawn from Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">No
                            record of this conversation has been found.</note> This was because
                        their reaction in the event of hostilities would be automatic, which the
                        French want to avoid. We should not retreat from the positions taken during
                        the <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> visit to Bonn<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">See <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note>—nor
                        in the subsequent decisions taken by the 14. Let's see what it is that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> offers. The U.S. fully
                        understands that Germany does not wish to have occupation troops in Germany.
                        We do for our part, however, have a <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0444"/>very real military interest in the status of other troops in Germany. We
                        need to know what the French troops will do in the event of war. In the
                        Secretary's judgment <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will
                        probably not accept automatic involvement—or foreign command—in the event of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that he was glad to hear
                        what the Secretary had said. Germany's defense, one might say, consists of
                        various layers. It is impossible to organize unless all elements know what
                        the others will do. He is not optimistic that we will be able to reach
                        agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on the troop
                        issue. When thinking of whether or not to make concessions—we must remember
                        that NATO must not only deter but be in a position to fight.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we must not show an anti-French attitude—but should
                        proceed quietly. Couve had yesterday given evidence that he would retreat
                        when challenged. He didn't know what would come out in the end.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked how the U.S. expected to come out in its own bilateral
                        negotiations with France. The Secretary replied that we would be delayed
                        beyond the time limit set by the French in moving some of the big
                        installations we had in France. He did not believe, however, that they would
                        be confiscated by the French. In dealing with the oil pipeline, for example,
                        we want to be sure that oil will come out of the other end when we need
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor referred to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        forthcoming visit to Moscow. He was not concerned as to the outcome, since
                        he could see no possible “joint line of policy.” <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wants “to have his back free” in negotiating for
                        the future of Europe. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he
                        particularly feared, in this connection, the “softening up” of Europe. He
                        was glad to know that his own Foreign Minister had spoken in Brussels
                        against a NATO-Warsaw Pact discussion. He considered that this would be
                        dangerous. What were the Secretary's views?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that there had
                        been no official discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> visit between U.S. and the French. Couve had, however,
                        in his personal discussions with the Secretary, promised that there would be
                        “no surprises.” The Soviets are not likely to value very highly French
                        ability to deliver in any agreements made. As he had said in the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting, America would expect to be
                        present in any negotiation for the future of Germany and Europe. We are in
                        Europe and we have interests here, and we will play a role in any
                        negotiations about its future.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that the upcoming negotiations between NATO and
                        France are likely to be very tough. The Chancellor asked if he has any
                        timetable in mind for these negotiations. The Secretary replied that the
                        French troop issue was perhaps the most important. It would tend to set the
                        timetable. If this drags on interminably, a very unfavorable impression will
                        be created. The Chancellor commented that the bilateral <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0445"/>German talks with the French will involve
                        only legal questions affecting the status of the French forces. No
                        agreements on these matters would be finally approved except in agreement
                        with the 14.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the real trouble in Brussels was with Canadian
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> and the Danes.
                        The five nations named to negotiate with the French on the troop issue are a
                        solid group. If they stick together, he believes we will prevail. There may
                        be troubles along the way, but not in the final stages.</p>

                            reported the details of the North Atlantic Council sessions devoted to
                            drafting the final communique. (Ibid.) For text of the communique, see

                    <p>1. At conclusion of tense two day confrontation between French and Fourteen,
                        and after agreement reached on major substantive issues, atmosphere in
                        communique session June 9 bordered on bonhomie. Bracketed words and
                        sentences, which on other occasions might have produced fireworks, were
                        abandoned in an atmosphere approaching gayety. It was as if French and
                        Fourteen, having broken on key issue of French troops in Germany and
                        subsequently reaching compromise, were eager to show their ability to agree
                        on traditional issues of kind dealt with NATO communique issued by the
                        Fifteen.</p>
                    <p>2. In marked contrast to the French behavior in the communique drafting
                        session during the previous two days, when French representatives fought
                        hard to reduce or eliminate reference to Soviet strength and aims, <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> and (when he arrived later)
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> lost no time in removing
                        French reservations on language indicting “the basic aims of the Soviet
                        Union” and recalling NATO's repeated moderation when faced with provocation
                        and hostile actions. Effect of earlier French moves had been to imply main
                        European problems were non-European hegemonies, that tensions arose almost
                        equally from US and USSR, and that <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0446"/>European instability was mainly traceable to Germany. French Delegation
                        voluntarily lifted reservations in both instances (paras 6 and 7 Secto 102
                        from Brussels) without waiting for appeal to do so. The result was a
                        significantly stronger and more realistic communique.</p>
                    <p>3. When the Secretary opposed reference to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> study of Danish idea for an European security conference,
                        together with disarmament and non-proliferation, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> was quick to support the US. He agreed with the
                        Secretary that it was dangerous to raise false hopes in this area. Fanfani
                        and others also supported deletion and the reference (in para 11 of
                        communique) was dropped. (See Brussels Secto 105.)</p>
                    <p>4. Finally, the para concerning the report of the Chairman of the Special
                        Committee contained alternative bracketed versions; the longer one described
                        the nature of the committee's work. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> appealed for the shorter alternative which merely
                        states that further report will be submitted in December. The shorter
                        version, he said, would be “more agreeable” to the French Delegation. The
                        Secretary said since French had withdrawn several reservations in course of
                        meeting, US would follow <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>'s
                        example and longer alternative was dropped. French had asked for this
                        deletion ahead of time, and had been told our attitude would be influenced
                        by how discussion went on communique as a whole.</p>
                    <p>5. Even though Brosio is not the world's most decisive Chairman, the whole
                        communique was edited and agreed by Ministers in just one hour, which may be
                        a NATO record. Both French and Fourteen thus made considerable effort to end
                        a ticklish meeting, which did not narrow the substantive gulf between them,
                        on a note of personal and professional good fellowship. The resulting press
                        play is largely devoid of extreme claims of diplomatic victory and defeat.
                        Le Monde's headline this afternoon is a reasonable summary:</p>
                    <p>“The Atlantic conference witnessed neither a trial of France nor the
                        disintegration of NATO's Fourteen.”</p>

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">You might ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> to summarize the conclusions and recommendations
                            of the nuclear study</hi>.</p>
                    <p>He will recommend that: (a) you instruct <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                        explore with the British and the Germans how we might proceed with <hi rend="italic">institutionalizing consultation and with assigning more
                            strategic nuclear forces to NATO </hi>; (b) for the time being, we leave
                        open—without prejudice—the question of a “collective force”. (These
                        recommendations reflect agreement between State and Defense and seem to us
                        just right.)</p>
                    <p>—After hearing out Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>, you
                        will wish to ask for the Secretary's views, especially on timing and tactics

                    <p>—Again, you will wish to hear out Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>. He will make some general points on the U.S. stance
                        in Europe and end up with a long list of specific proposals for
                        strengthening NATO and for bridge-building. (You might wish to glance again
                        at the headings in the paper at Tab B, Annex A.)</p>
                    <p>—You might ask the Secretary to have each proposal properly staffed for final

                        consultation and assignment; study &amp; discuss collective force in
                        interim, (2) U.S. meanwhile takes no action to prejudice collective force
                        (i.e. non-proliferation terms), or which diverge from concept of German
                        equality.</p>

                    <p>c. Intrinsically experimental (V-bombers wear out in 7 years).</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>In a conversation with the Ambassador today, I referred to the press reports
                        about possible Soviet troop reductions. Dobrynin said he had nothing
                        official on this but indicated that a reduction was quite possible. He asked
                        if I thought that we would be interested in any reduction by way of mutual
                        example. I pointed out that the question of whether or not the French troops
                        would remain in Germany was still open and there might be a considerable
                        reduction there if the French and Germans did not succeed in working out
                        arrangements for them to stay.</p>
                    <p> Dobrynin indicated his view, which he said was based on informal talks with
                        the French and other reports, that it was almost certain that a way would be
                        found for the French troops to remain. I said I also had no specific
                        information, but I did not think that it was at all certain.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked if I thought a troop reduction on our part in Germany
                        would cause much of a political stir here. I replied that as on <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>most matters, there would always be some
                        division of opinion, but I did not think that this was the kind of thing
                        that would stir up much public interest here. On the other hand, with all
                        the problems that NATO now had, it did not seem to me a very good time for
                        us to be thinking about such a matter. He said he could understand this. On
                        the other hand, I said that my personal view was that the Soviets did not
                        need twenty divisions in East Germany. I said that one problem, of course,
                        was that our troops would have to come all the way across the Atlantic,
                        whereas theirs did not have so far to go.</p>
                    <p> Dobrynin said the Soviets had raised this subject many times and indicated
                        that he thought his Government would be quite prepared to carry out
                        reductions on the basis of mutual example. He indicated that in his view a
                        mutual reduction need not necessarily be on a one-for-one basis.</p>

                        has stated its intention to withdraw French forces in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> from NATO command as of July 1, 1966. As
                        the United States pointed out in its aide-memoire of April 12, 1966, if
                        these forces are so withdrawn, the US-France-NATO Atomic Stockpile Agreement
                        of September 6, 1960 will cease by its own terms to have application. The
                        Government of France should also be aware that in this eventuality certain
                        portions of the US-France Agreement for Cooperation in the Operation of
                        Atomic Weapons Systems of July 27, 1961 also will cease by their own terms
                        to apply on July 1. Therefore, assuming no new or interim arrangements will
                        have been made by that time which would permit continued US atomic support
                        for these forces, the practical measures which would necessarily have to be
                        taken are as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. The US nuclear weapons currently made available for possible wartime use
                        by French forces in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will cease to be
                        so available and will be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>b. The transfer of US atomic information under the US-France Agreement of
                        July 27, 1961, hitherto furnished in consideration of the assignment to NATO
                        of French nuclear-capable forces will be suspended. These measures follow
                        from those terms of the two aforementioned agreements which envisage
                        commitment of French nuclear- capable forces to NATO. Accordingly, they do
                        not reflect any intention on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to terminate these agreements. The question of possible
                        future United States support of French forces in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will depend upon the role and mission of such forces and
                        their relationship to NATO. With further regard to the Agreement of July 27,
                        1961, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, in the interest of the
                        continuing fulfillment of the respective responsibilities of the two
                        Governments under that Agreement, desires to arrange in the near future for
                        a visit of a US Security Working Group to review the implementing procedures
                        of the agencies responsible for the protection of documents and information
                        provided under the Agreement. In order to facilitate such a survey, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> requests the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> to furnish to it a report through normal channels listing
                        all unit holders of US atomic information as of June 30, 1966. <hi rend="italic">End text</hi>.</p>
                    <p>2. You should inform the foreign office orally that details on the withdrawal
                        of weapons will be made available to French Commanders through <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> and necessary cooperation
                        worked out at that level. Further information on the Security survey will be
                        provided <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0452"/>French Government at their
                        request. You may state, however, that similar surveys are made from time to
                        time of other countries pursuant to relevant bilateral Agreements for
                        Cooperation, and that in the case of France none has taken place since the
                        review made in 1960 prior to the conclusion of the 1961 Agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. We envisage informing press of general substance of aide-memoire in low
                        key manner after delivery, emphasizing points suggested for Cleveland
                        presentation to Fourteen above. We would not propose to release text unless
                        this subsequently proves to be necessary to correct possible
                        misunderstandings. Press guidance will follow.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName>, in his June 6 talk
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">No further record of this conversation has been
                            found.</note> said France is ready to discuss and to conclude an
                        agreement with the United States on the wartime use of facilities in
                        France.</p>
                    <p>Discussing reentry rights—under what circumstances, with what rights, and
                        into what facilities we can reenter—will enable us to determine whether and
                        to what degree France will agree to reentry provisions that are dependable
                        in crisis and operationally adequate. Such a determination is essential in
                        military planning in order to assess the risk of relying on France. Perhaps
                        more important, it will give the United States and its thirteen allies a
                        gauge to measure the degree, if any, to which the French Government is
                        willing to cooperate in an emergency. Properly handled, it should clarify
                        thinking and unify action.</p>
                    <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0453"/>
                    <p>The normal way to conduct such a negotiation would be to ask the French
                        Government to grant the United States, in case of emergency under Article V
                        of the North Atlantic Treaty, the rights covered in our bilateral agreements
                        in the manner provided therein. This would provide the French with an
                        opportunity, if they desire it, to narrow the rights offered, which this
                        Government can then appraise.</p>
                    <p>If you concur, I therefore propose to commence conversations with the French
                        on reentry rights and facilities as soon as our representative is prepared;
                        we have consulted with our allies and have coordinated the timing with other
                        negotiations between the fourteen and France and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and France.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> should be our
                        representative to conduct the talks; I plan to call him in to discuss the
                        problems in detail, both with the State and Defense Departments, to instruct
                        him generally in accordance with the attached Memorandum of Guidance, which
                        can of course be modified in light of subsequent developments, and to
                        reinforce him with the necessary experts.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has approved both
                        this Memorandum and the enclosed Memorandum for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Evacuating U.S. military personnel and installations in France, in response
                        to the French aide-memoire of March 10 [11],<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">

                        military posture in Europe, and will also impose substantial financial
                        loss.</p>
                    <p>Such reduced effectiveness and financial loss can be limited if the French
                        will agree to dependable and timely rights of reentry and operation, <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0454"/>effective in time of NATO
                        emergency, into bases and facilities that are adequately maintained and
                        supplied, and with the rights of access, movement, transport, communications
                        and personnel status needed to allow immediate operations.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the Government of France should refuse reentry and
                        operation provisions which are sufficiently reliable for the U.S. to depend
                        on them for the support of forces in combat, the agreements that might be
                        reached would be hollow. In this case, we should establish conclusively,
                        both to our own satisfaction and that of our allies, that meaningful reentry
                        agreements are not possible under the present French policies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives</p>
                    <p>To conclude satisfactory agreements with France for reentry and operation

                    <p>If agreements reached between the U.S. and France on the reentry and

                        operational, when hostilities commence. The use<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">The history of the Dillon-Bidault Agreement makes clear that the “use”
                            of facilities in France relates only to use for launching air attacks
                            with nuclear weapons. The agreement asked for and given was described as
                            “a U.K.-type of assurance” (i.e., President-Prime Minister exchanges on
                            use of U.K. facilities at which U.S. nuclear weapons are maintained; the
                            U.K. is entitled to be consulted before the U.S. uses such weapons).

                            April 8, 1954, at Paris, confirmed assurances given by the French
                            Government that the use of French bases and installations would, in time
                            of emergency, be a matter for joint decision by the United States and
                            France.]</note> of the bases and installations placed at the disposition
                        of the U.S. Government by the Government of France was, by the
                        Dillon-Bidault Agreement, made in time of emergency “a matter for joint

                        the time.” The reentry and operating rights sought, however, should become
                        effective at the time the NATO commands whose missions depend upon the
                        availability of the facilities assume an operational status. The rights must
                        include access, communications, transport, nuclear transit, overflights,
                        status of forces, etc., as appropriate.</p>

                    <p>The following elements of the French position have emerged:</p>
                    <p>a. Termination of the existing U.S.-France bilateral agreements<note n="7" xml:id="d181fn7">(1) Chateauroux Depot Agreement of February 27, 1951;
                            (2) Paris Air Bases Agreement of October 4, 1952; (3) United States
                            Military Headquarters Agreement of June 17, 1953; (4) Pipeline Agreement
                            of June 30, 1953; and (5) System of Communications Agreement of December
                            8, 1958. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> by “mutual consent.”</p>
                    <p>b. Initial discussions to deal with an overall wartime reentry and
                        utilization agreement, to be followed by a series of technical agreements
                        covering the facilities that would be made available to the U.S. in time of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>c. There is no reason to oppose continued use of the pipeline, but its
                        operation should be under unilateral French control at all times.</p>
                    <p>d. No stocked storage depots will be permitted in France.</p>
                    <p>e. Reentry rights will be restricted to “a conflict in which both countries
                        would participate under the Atlantic Alliance.”</p>
                    <p>f. Reentry rights will depend on a decision by the French Government taken at
                        the time of the emergency.</p>

                        take them at face value. But if what <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De
                            Leusse</persName> said this morning (essentially confirming what he told
                        me last week—Paristel 9091 Exdis-Notal)<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">Telegram

                            revealed the French were aware of difficulties of reconciling <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s insistence on bilateral
                            political negotiations with the fact that both Germany and the United
                            States considered bilateral negotiations closely connected to the

                        out to be what the French Government means, we have turned a significant
                        corner in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>3. Despite <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s insistence this
                        morning in answer to questions posed June 21 (Paristel 8976),<note n="4" xml:id="d182fn4">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> that answers would have to
                        be found by military commanders, he did address himself rather responsively
                        to what the Fourteen consider political questions in a clearly political
                        forum.</p>
                    <p>4. It appears from <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s answers
                        that the French do want to retain troops in Germany, and to work out some
                        reasonable basis for their remaining there. The only such basis is, of
                        course, that they be related to the rest of the NATO forces in the central
                        region of Allied Command Europe. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De
                            Leusse</persName>'s replies indicated that the French Government would
                        explicitly accept tasks and missions that would be related to NATO forces,
                        would promise to fit French forces into NATO command structure in time of
                        war, would participate in Council decisions on NATO crisis alerts, and would
                        cooperate “increasingly” in time of peace, when troops would be (like those
                        of other nations) under national command.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> was careful at every
                        stage to speak of these matters as perfectly natural and hardly worth
                        mentioning, and to repeat that these are really matters for detailed
                        negotiations between French Chief of Staff and <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. But even with these caveats, the sum total of <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s statement was a far-reaching
                        admission that (except for air defense) France would be prepared to work
                        with NATO in something like the same patterns of cooperation which the rest
                        of us practice. The main difference is that they will not use NATO
                        terminology in describing the cooperation, and will advertise more loudly
                        than the rest of us do the national dedication which we have in fact all
                        reserved to our own governments <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0457"/>under the treaty, the Council's decisions, and the NATO alert system.</p>
                    <p>6. If <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s answers stick when
                        the Moscow delegation gets home, we will be in a position soon, perhaps next
                        week, to move on to the next stage of these negotiations. In that stage,
                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> and the French Chief of Staff
                        might be asked to develop agreed answers to certain specific questions,
                        reporting back to the Council. For this purpose, I assume that political
                        direction to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> will have to be
                        developed in the group of Fourteen; the French will be giving political
                        guidance to General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName>, and
                        they cannot very well be on both sides of the negotiation at once. But we
                        might well work out in the Council, after preliminary caucusing in the
                        Fourteen and consultation with General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, an agreed set of assumptions and questions to
                        which the military talks would address themselves. We are drafting the kind
                        of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> paper we have in mind and will submit
                        it by cable soonest.</p>
                    <p>7. We have assumed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        would want to keep some French troops in Germany, at least until after the
                        Parliamentary elections, so that it could not be said that the consequence
                        of Gaullist policy was to remove the French foot from Germany's head. It
                        seems more likely this week than previously that this analysis is
                        correct.</p>

                    <p>83. Eyes only for Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>. Subj:
                        German attitude on nuclear sharing.</p>
                    <p>1. During the visit of Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> to
                        Bonn over the last two days, he had many useful discussions with the highest
                        German authorities on various disarmament issues, which are being reported
                        separately. Of particular value, however, was his probing of the German
                        attitude on <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0458"/>nuclear sharing. In his
                        meetings with FonMin <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and
                        DefMin <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>, reported in
                        Embtels 84 and 85,<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">Both dated July 2. (Ibid.,
                            DEF 18–3 SWITZ(GE))</note> he sought without indicating any change in US
                        policy toward a “hardware solution” to the problem, to determine what the
                        real German position on such a solution is.</p>
                    <p>2. As might have been expected, both <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName> held firm in asserting that the Germans still seek a
                        “hardware solution.” The extent of which this view is shared by others is
                        not known, however, there is no one else in the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Fraktion who takes a
                        very positive line on the issue except Deputy Kurt Birrenbach—whose views
                        are well known to us. Recently, however, he told me confidentially that the
                        “hardware solution” was his second choice—his first being the traditional
                            <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> position of seeking participation in
                        planning and decision—recommending—not just for nuclear forces under <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> but <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> at its convention in Dortmund on
                        June 1–5, of course, rejected the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        concept and the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> has never endorsed it.
                        It is believed that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                        has little independent conviction on the issue. However, he has in the past
                        followed <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>'s line. One middle rank FonOff
                        official, following <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, asked us pointedly why
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had not pressed <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> harder on the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>,
                        shrugging his shoulders in dismay. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
                            Hassel</persName>, in his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, had indicated a willingness to give up a “hardware
                        solution” but only under certain circumstances, i.e., that the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee evolve into an
                        acceptable basis for planning and crisis management in the nuclear area,
                        backed up by sure and instant communications.</p>
                    <p>4. The following are believed to be the motives underlying <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroe-der</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>'s attitude. I believe that Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, with whom I discussed this analysis
                        in general would agree. This is, of course, in addition to <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>'s natural desire as political leaders not to have
                        to admit the failure of a project with which they have been so closely
                        associated.</p>
                    <p>A) The “hardware solution” now has a certain status. It results from a US
                        proposal to Germany which Germany accepted, and even though it has not yet
                        come into being we have not withdrawn it. We admitted during the
                        Chancellor's visit to Washington last December<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">See <ref target="#d119">Document 119</ref>.</note> that the proposition
                        was still on the table subject to discussions with the other countries
                        involved—which have of course never materialized. The Germans, as von Hassel
                        indicated to <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, are not now
                        pressing for a decision. They are in the position of having been accepted as
                        being qualified for membership in a hardware-owning organization, which they
                        consider has already brought them a certain prestige and bargaining power.
                        In a <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0459"/>sense, they have for the first
                        time been recognized as first class nuclear citizens. Since the ultimate
                        success of the project seems doubtful, they would prefer a continuation of
                        the present situation to a “showdown.” As I understand, Birrenbach told
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> this morning that this
                        option must be kept open until a European nuclear option can be tangible
                        enough to take its place. If the hardware approach were abandoned, the
                        Germans would lose the present symbolism and potential for bargaining which
                        it provides—even in limbo.</p>
                    <p>B) I believe that both <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> also see in the
                        “hardware solution” a hedge against the uncertainty of the future. NATO may
                        change drastically in its organization or policy. Technical changes may
                        upset the balance between conventional nuclear defense, or between defense
                        and offense in either category. There may be a drastic change in US policy,
                        i.e. an isolationist government may come into power. Under such
                        circumstances, the Germans are reluctant to commit themselves, especially to
                        their implacable enemy the Soviets, in a way which would tie their hands in
                        the future. Many Germans have always had in the back of their mind the
                        possibility that they could in extremis make a nuclear deal with the French
                        comparable to the one they have with us. By 1970, moreover, the French
                        should have quite a respectable nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>C) Another probable <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> motivation is a conviction on
                        their part that participation in a “hardware solution” puts them on the
                        inside for future developments. For example, once such an organization had
                        been developed, if a new weapon is developed, the Germans would naturally be
                        in on it. They would be in on any extension of the powers or scope of the
                        initial organization.</p>
                    <p>D) Both <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, although they would of course not
                        admit it directly to us, undoubtedly value the bargaining power of their
                        present position—both vis-a-vis US and the Soviets. With US it can perhaps
                        be traded in to assure that something suitable comes out of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee—which <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> has indicated he is not yet
                        sure will produce the desired end result. vis-a-vis the Soviets, the Germans
                        would hope to gain at least some way station on the long road toward
                        reunification.</p>
                    <p>E) <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>, moreover, undoubtedly feel
                        that they are under no pressure to abandon the “hardware solution” because
                        there are many other unresolved differences blocking a non-proliferation
                        agreement, including that with the Indians. In the event nuclear sharing
                        should become the sole remaining obstacle, they would likely find themselves
                        under unbearable pressure to yield. However, there is ample time to make the
                        required concessions and the probability is that it will not be necessary at
                        all.</p>
                    <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0460"/>
                    <p>F) <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> may conclude that German
                        influence under a “hardware solution” would be greater than in a
                        consultative arrangement, since they would be in a position to buy a
                        proportionately larger share than some of the smaller European countries
                        involved. This may, moreover, see in a hardware approach the ultimate
                        solution of their offset problem. Buying into a nuclear weapon system could
                        absorb a large proportion of the offset payment for several years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I assume that it is our present policy to so
                        steer the outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        committee [so] that a nuclear consultative organization will be created
                        which, at least for the time being, will satisfy German nuclear ambitions.
                        If this is the case, I hope that the recommendations which will go forward
                        to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> in its December Ministerial
                        Meeting will be broad enough to take this requirement into account. From the
                        German viewpoint, the scope of the new group's final decision—recommending
                        powers should include not only nuclear forces under <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> but our own <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. This latter extension has never troubled me since, in such
                        circumstances, I believe the President would want to know the attitude of
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, in whose country his
                        troops are or may be fighting, before making a final nuclear decision. If we
                        are willing to go this far, I believe that we could swap off such a result
                        to the Germans for an agreement to forego a “hardware solution” for the
                        foreseeable future. It might be desirable, however, to endow any new
                        consultative committee with standby powers which could ultimately provide an
                        umbrella for such a solution. This would give us the needed flexibility in
                        arranging the nuclear affairs of the Alliance in the future, and permit the
                        Germans to retain their status as acceptable and potential nuclear
                        part-owners. The obstacle such a development might create with the Soviets
                        achieving a non-proliferation agreement, might be overcome if provision
                        could be made in the agreement that the Soviets have the option of
                        withdrawing from the agreement—in the event that a new nuclear force is
                        created—even one which we could easily prove did not constitute
                        proliferation.</p>

                    <p>108. Ref: Deptel 7056.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">Telegram 7056 to Paris,
                            June 30, transmitted the Department of State's preliminary thinking on
                            the phasing of negotiations between the French and the 14 NATO states.
                            The telegram also noted the hope that the U.S.-French talks on re-entry
                            could begin early in July. (Ibid.)</note> It seems to me that the French
                        in attempting to do the delicate balancing act between departure from NATO
                        and remaining in Alliance are confronted with a genuine dilemma. In order to
                        give effect to their fallacious premise concerning integration, the French
                        have recently made it clear that they do not intend to return to integration
                        via the back door and are obviously reluctant to maintain in substance the
                        previous command relationship, for example in regard to the French forces in
                        Germany, as existed prior to French action. On the other hand it is
                        extremely difficult to see how any formula for command relationship in time
                        of war with <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, which would have any
                        validity and acceptability to the Fourteen which would not in effect merely
                        repeat what had previously existed.</p>
                    <p>It is our understanding that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        wishes to have the theoretical possibility in some instances, and the actual
                        possibility in others of a purely French decision in regard to French
                        participation in a war. In a number of cases, such as sudden massive Soviet
                        attack on Europe, the question is completely theoretical and French reaction
                        would be almost instantaneous. However, in others, notably in the case of
                        some Soviet action in regard to Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> might choose to interpret Soviet action as resulting
                        from some U.S./Soviet clash in the Far East and decide that France should
                        remain neutral. Another similar situation might arise if there were a revolt
                        inside any satellite area, particularly East Germany, in which France might
                        disagree with her allies. In actual fact these contingencies were covered in
                        previous NATO arrangements whereby, except for air defense, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> had no command over
                        any existing forces and would only receive command as a result of positive
                        and conscious action by governments concerned.</p>
                    <p>It is of course true that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        apparently sees in anything that smacks of automatism a danger of involving
                        France by momentum, perhaps against her will and her interests, but this is
                        very thin and it merely means that France would be in a worse position to
                        hold out against the rest of the Alliance before rather than after
                        withdrawal from NATO organization.</p>

                    <p>This message is to point to a problem which may become more important as time
                        goes on. It does not appear from our conversations with French officials,
                        notably my last talk with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName> (Embtel 8915)<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Telegram
                            8915 from Paris, June 18, reported that <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> had confirmed in a brief conversation
                            that France had no national interest in maintaining troops in Germany
                            but would be prepared to leave them there for the sake of French-German
                            relations. (Ibid.)</note> that this problem. i.e., how to reconcile
                        membership in Alliance with absence from organization, has either been
                        thoroughly studied or decided. It is probable that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, with the preparations for his
                        Moscow trip, has not himself seriously considered it.</p>
                    <p>However, he will undoubtedly have to examine this problem carefully now and
                        reach a conclusion thereon in a relatively short time.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> said that he wanted to be
                        very sure about the decision the President was alleged to have made with
                        respect to the memorandum on bilateral negotiations between the United
                        States and France, a decision he understood had been made at lunch on
                        Thursday, June 28.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">The memorandum is the
                            Enclosure to <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>. The reference
                            should be to the luncheon on Tuesday, June 28. No other record of the
                            luncheon has been found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow said the President's decision was clear, a point confirmed by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, which was to approve the
                        memorandum. The President had raised specifically the question as to whether
                        the U.S. would <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0463"/>have any interest in
                        any facilities in France if we were not sure of their availability.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on that occasion
                        said “No, not if we had to put a nickel into their maintenance.” The
                        President approved that position.</p>
                    <p>In further discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName>
                        pursued this point, saying that we would clearly encounter in the future the
                        suggestion that anything we got from the French “would be gravy and that we
                        should be willing to compromise to get it.” Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. Rostow repeated that this
                        was precisely the question on which the President had ruled. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> emphasized that any
                        contingent rights would of course cost us money.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> said that he was having
                        trouble with people in both Departments who were wavering and seemed to be
                        interested in seeking some compromise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said in this connection that an
                        alternative version of the memorandum for the President had come to him, but
                        he had rejected it. There should be no question about his position or
                        therefore about the position of the Defense Department. He went on to say
                        that he looked upon the bilateral negotiations as a probe urgent and
                        necessary to test French intentions with respect to Article V of the North
                        Atlantic Treaty. He expected nothing to result from it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> said that he would subsequently be
                        in touch with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                        the purpose of which would be to go over the supplementary instructions to

                    <p>I would suggest the following course of action in pursuing these
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>During the visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, you or the President might refer to suggestions for
                        tripartite discussions of the nuclear question in the President's letter of
                        May 21<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">
                            <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> and indicate that with
                        the completion of some internal US policy consideration of this matter, such
                        discussions would seem to be timely. The same suggestion could be made to
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> during his visit in
                        August or by letter if the visit is postponed.</p>
                    <p>In describing the framework of the talks and providing assurances to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, we might indicate that the
                        US policy review reaffirmed that the US would take no action which would
                        prejudice later decision to create a collective force.</p>
                    <p>We might suggest that the tripartite talks be conducted primarily by the
                        Foreign Ministers of the UK, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the
                        United States in connection with other meetings which bring the three
                        together. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in
                        September, the tentative October meeting of NATO ministers, or the regular
                        December NATO Ministerial Meetings might provide such opportunities. Defense
                        Ministers of the three governments would be associated with the talks when
                        brought together by either the Special Committee or NATO Ministerial
                        Meetings.</p>
                    <p>As a starting point in preparation for such discussions, and to provide
                        continuity, we might propose that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> or State Department Officials designated by him,
                        discuss the question with the UK and German Ambassadors beginning in
                        mid-September, or earlier if possible.</p>

                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> that

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> (France) in special
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> today made formal opening statement
                        in which he said France could not discuss Fourteen's paper on assumptions.
                        He described Fourteen's interpretation of France's position as “more or less
                        distorted”. Question was simply one of continuation or cessation of
                        stationing French forces in Germany. Questions had been defined in Brussels
                        and could usefully be discussed only by military authorities. While there
                        was no objection to an exchange of views in the Council this had taken place
                        and it was now appropriate to charge the military authorities with
                        undertaking a concrete conversation. The French Government would have no
                        objection at the proper time to submitting to the Council for its approval
                        the conclusions of these conversations. (Full text of this statement by

                        discussions” to “difficult to discuss”. Immediately after opening statement
                        he proceeded to discuss document by explaining French position on
                        assumptions D and E (command and alerts) by quoting from his statements at
                        the June 21 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">See <ref target="#d182fn2">footnote 2, Document 182</ref>.</note> In a
                        subsequent intervention, he rehearsed briefly France's position on all seven
                        assumptions. Finally, he did not refuse when <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> requested him to seek authority to try to reach
                        understanding with the Fourteen along the lines of the assumptions.</p>
                    <p>2. All who spoke said that <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s
                        statement created a new situation which would have to be studied in capitals
                        and instructions sought. Consensus of personal views expressed was that
                        stage described in para 4(D) of Brussels communique<note n="5" xml:id="d187fn5">For text of this communique, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1966</hi>, pp.

                        been reached. Upshot of meeting was that Brosio requested de Leusse to
                        ascertain whether he could discuss the ideas in the assumptions with the <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0466"/>Fourteen with a view to reaching an
                        agreement on the political level. Otherwise, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thought that the Council in permanent session would
                        have reached an impasse and that the situation would have to be considered
                        by the Ministers as provided in para 4(E) of the Brussels communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        does not seriously intend to bring this issue to a head during the
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>3. Highlights of discussion were as follows:</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said his instructions did
                        not cover the situation created as the result of <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s statement. The U.S. did not contemplate moving
                        to military level discussions with no agreed indications from the political
                        level as to assumptions. Without agreed guidance from the political level,
                        the military level would not know on what basis to discuss concrete
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) preliminary impression was that there was not much
                        difference in substance between Fourteen's assumptions and <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName>'s statements. He appealed to de
                        Leusse to try and reach agreement with the Fourteen and reduce it to
                        writing. <persName corresp="#p_LSB2">De Leusse</persName> in his reply did
                        not fully close the door on this suggestion. He said that he had used the
                        word “difficult” in his opening statement in describing discussion of the
                        Fourteen's paper and noted that he had talked about two points.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> (Belgium) said that
                        the Fourteen's paper was not a treaty but an attempt to reduce to writing
                        the Fourteen's understanding of France's general position. Neither France
                        nor the Fourteen had the right to define positions “ex cathedra” and expect
                        them to be accepted by the other. He supported appeal for negotiations.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> (UK), Alessandrini
                        (Italy), Boon (Netherlands) and Birgi (Turkey) all supported idea of French
                        and Fourteen trying to work out agreement on assumptions. <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> observed that the form of the
                        paper was less important than its contents. As originally drafted it was a
                        statement of assumptions by the Fourteen as to the position of the 15th. An
                        understanding between France and the Fourteen could be expressed
                        differently, for example as a statement as to what the Fifteen understood to
                        be the position of France.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> have
                        endeavored to examine in some depth the implications of a hard pitch by the
                        President to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        urging the U.K. to announce its willingness to sign the Treaty of Rome and
                        to accept the legislation enacted by the Community institutions in the past
                        seven and a half years.</p>
                    <p>The issues are incredibly complex and the staff papers attached to this
                            memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">None of the seven attached
                            papers, designated A–G, is printed.</note> reflect in some degree this
                        complexity and our confusion in sorting out the issues. We have come out
                        with roughly the following conclusions.</p>
                    <p>1. On balance there are advantages in reiterating at the highest level the
                        American view that Britain's future lies in Europe. These advantages however
                        are largely in terms of political gamesmanship and in clarifying, if
                        clarification is needed, the American view.</p>
                    <p>2. We think it likely that if such an approach were made by the President,
                        the Prime Minister would reply with an eloquent exposition of his domestic
                        and foreign problems meant in essence to demonstrate that he is right in his
                        present course of probing for an opening into Europe, protecting his
                        negotiating position and trying to put the British economy on an even keel.
                        It is possible, however, that upon reflection a clear statement by the
                        President would eventually influence his course of action.</p>
                    <p>3. If <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> were to accept the
                        President's advice, we think it highly unlikely that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would permit his entry into the
                        Common Market, and we suspect that the French argument about the economic
                        dangers for the Community in pledging “mutual support” for sterling is
                        gradually having a debilitating effect on the political will of the Five to
                        welcome Britain.</p>
                    <p>4. In the highly unlikely event that something tangible happened, the
                        possible preconditions for adaptation of the British economy to the Common
                        Market, which might include devaluation, would have substantial <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0468"/>adverse effects (probably $500–850 million
                        per year) on the U.S. balance of payments position. Moreover, initiation of
                        serious negotiations before the Kennedy Round is concluded could be the
                        death knell of that enterprise. Some negotiations by the U.K. and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> are inevitable, simply because of the
                        technical features of the Treaty of Rome on such subjects as voting in the
                        Council, budgetary shares and even membership in the Commissions.</p>
                    <p>5. In the long run the political gains from U.K. membership in the European
                        Communities are in our interest. As in the short run, an unequivocal British
                        willingness to join the Communities would significantly strengthen the Five
                        in dealing with Gaullist France and indirectly help the Fourteen hold NATO
                        together, whatever the French do.</p>
                    <p>The attached working papers, while generally compatible with these
                        conclusions, also reflect significant differences of view. The assumptions
                        about whether Britain would or would not need to devalue are particularly
                        critical, and the estimated effects on the U.K. and U.S. balance of payments
                        from a devaluation of sterling must give one pause. We estimate that the
                        short-run economic costs of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> entry to the
                        U.K. would be very high and might require devaluation as a prelude to entry.
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> entry would cost the U.K. balance of
                        payments as much as $800 million per year over the long run. A 10 percent
                        devaluation supported by internal deflationary measures could gain them at
                        least $1.5 billion annually in the short run and $1.75 billion in the
                        long-run.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, in the light of the reportedly Draconian deflationary
                        measures about to be taken by the U.K., there is still some reason to hope
                        that, if Wilson were prepared to withstand the increased political pressures
                        associated with rigorous deflation over an extended time period, Britain
                        could adapt to the Common Market without devaluation. Success for these
                        measures would diminish the objective economic problem and make French
                        opposition to U.K. entry more difficult, but it would not be decisive in
                        eliminating the basic French political veto on U.K. admission.</p>

                    <p>I can't quite go along with the pessimistic tone of these conclusions. Also,
                        paragraph 4 neglects to point out that the adverse impact on the U.S.
                        balance of payments of a British devaluation would still be more or less the
                        same no matter how the U.K. gets into balance of payments equilibrium. I do
                        believe, however, that a public announcement, as distinguished from private
                        feelers, of U.K. determination to enter the Common Market would injure the
                        Kennedy Round at this time.</p>

                    <p>1. The third Ministerial Meeting of the Nuclear Planning Working Group was
                        held in Paris July 26 with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in chair. Ministers agreed to charge the Deputies
                        with preparation of specific proposals for permanent NATO bodies to carry on
                        the work of <gloss target="#t_SPECOM1">SPECOM</gloss> and the NPWG to be
                        considered at next NPWG meeting in Rome September 23 and 24. (For text of

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Although there was agreement on general lines of U.S. approach (State
                        11919), Ministers were not now prepared to take specific decisions on
                        composition of permanent bodies or commit themselves to submitting final
                        recommendations in December.</p>
                    <p>3. Topaloglu (Turkey) made strong pitch for membership criteria for Nuclear
                        Planning Group along lines his July 24 talk with Cleveland (Paris 1153)
                        which confirmed that one of most difficult problems we face in establishment
                        of permanent bodies will be that of composition.</p>
                    <p>4. Healey at breakfast with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> July 25 accepted U.S. draft minute which included
                        in mandate of new nuclear planning group future discussion of joint or
                        collective nuclear weapons systems (para 5C State 11919). However, during
                        meeting he suggested without notice the deletion of this provision with the
                        understanding that its omission did not exclude discussion of hardware in
                        the NPG. Healey said that some (he implied this did not necessarily include
                        him) would maintain that any future discussions of hardware should take
                        place among Fifteen. In addition, some Ministers in UK would argue that
                        creation of NATO restricted group on nuclear planning should be the occasion
                        to abandon discussion of collective hardware. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> quickly caved and agreed to deletion provided
                        record of meeting showed matter could be raised in new restricted group.
                        When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0470"/>out only international record of
                        NPWG was agreed minutes, the wording in para 4B was amended to include
                        “among others,” to make it clear that the three subjects to be considered by
                        the NPG are not exclusive. Our understanding of this legislative history is
                        that “hardware” projects are clearly to be discussable in the new planning
                        group.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> made a strong plea that the
                        new bodies be chaired by himself when meeting at Ministerial and PermRep
                        levels and that the staff support be provided by a new unit within NATO
                        International Staff. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> argued
                        that to do otherwise would weaken the integrated NATO organization and run
                        the risk of creating the impression of an alliance within the Alliance.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> gave his view
                        that progress in the first instance depended on the development and
                        consideration of national views on these important matters. Later, there
                        could be an effort to see which of these views all allies could share with a
                        view to developing a consensus or common doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said NATO was an instrument for the
                        expression and reconciliation of national views and saw no contradiction
                        between his proposal and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s view. He recognized that nuclear decisions would
                        be taken by heads of government consulting directly rather than in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> thought that nuclear matters were better discussed
                        initially in small group but he foresaw a stage at which the views of the
                        Nuclear Planning Group would become the concern of NATO as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The questions raised by <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> were
                        among those given to the Deputies for further study.</p>

                    <p>1. As we deadlocked in negotiations with France on French troops in Germany
                        this week, I took some soundings among my colleagues as to <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0471"/>why the French had in the end assumed so
                        unyielding a position in the face of our efforts to establish a political
                        basis for Lemnitzer-Ailleret talks. </p>
                    <p>2. The first reason given by everybody was Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s performance during the General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visit to Bonn. He was
                        evidently so anxious to please his guest and to have something that looked
                        like a political success after a disappointing provincial election, that he
                        must have given <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> the
                        impression that the Germans would never invite the French troops to leave,
                        no matter what. As long as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        thinks he has the Germans hexed, he is entitled to assume that he does not
                        need to permit serious discussions with the Fourteen about such issues as
                        the mission of those forces, command arrangements in wartime, coordination
                        in emergency alerts, and cooperation in peacetime exercises. </p>
                    <p>3. In these circumstances, I think it is important that this subject be
                        promoted to a pretty high priority in the President's discussions with
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> during the latter's visit
                        to Washington next month. If we can help with the staff work to this end, I
                        hope you will let me know. </p>

                    <p>(1) Two meetings have been held at sub-ministerial level to identify problems
                        relating to withdrawal of US forces and materiel from France. US indicated
                        that while it did not accept deadline of next April 1 for such withdrawal,
                        it nonetheless is planning removals as rapidly as feasible. It was made
                        clear, however, that a period beyond April 1 will be required to complete
                        removals of logistics facilities. These discussions are to continue as US
                        relocation plans are completed. </p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0472"/>
                    <p>(2) Two meetings have also been held at ministerial level regarding right of
                        re-entry by US forces and materiel into military facilities in France at
                        time of a NATO alert, or in other circumstances such as Berlin crisis.
                        French side made clear no US military personnel or stocks could remain in
                        France in peacetime. They will seek clarification whether exception could be
                        made for pipeline operation. Couve further made clear that his instructions
                        were that no re-entry would be possible except after declaration by war by
                        France. He was willing to seek clarification whether France might agree to
                        re-entry on occasion of NATO alert in which France participated. This will
                        be subject of further discussion in September. US indicated that it would
                        wish utilize certain airfield, depot and communication facilities as well as
                        pipeline in time of emergency so they would be fully operational in event of

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>,</p>
                    <p>I am writing to you today about certain press reports alleging that the
                        United States Administration intends to reduce the number of American forces
                        in Germany. Some of these reports are said to stem from background
                        information given to journalists by American officials, reference being made
                        among others to a talk between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Herr Gillesen of the Frankfurter Allgemeine
                        Zeitung. I do not know whether such conversations actually took place, and
                        even less whether their contents have been accurately reproduced by the
                        journalists, nor is there any need for me to tell you that my own judgment
                        has not been influenced by these press reports, but I have the feeling that
                        these apparently quite numerous background talks about American troops in
                        Germany do not do American-German relations any good. It is inevitable that
                        such statements, <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0473"/>however carefully
                        phrased, are given a sharper and more sensational accent in the press, which
                        of course has a particularly detrimental effect on a matter of such
                        delicacy. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Herr von Hassel</persName> has told
                        me about his Paris talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who, I was pleased to hear, dissociated himself
                        from the press reports and stated in particular that the 15,000 or so troops
                        withdrawn from Germany would be replaced by the end of the year. But I
                        wonder all the more whether it would not be better to refrain altogether
                        from giving to the press such intensive background information on the
                        question of American troops in Germany, since it is obviously not possible
                        to achieve the right and intended effect by means of such talks. </p>
                    <p>In my opinion this matter can only be dealt with satisfactorily if our two
                        Governments exchange their views very frankly and confidentially in as small
                        a group as possible. I hope that the Chancellor's visit to Washington at the
                        end of September will offer an opportunity for it. I am, dear Dean, very
                        much looking forward to seeing you again on that occasion.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">On August 8, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>

                            this letter and said that the subject of American troop levels should be

                    </list>
                    <p>You will recall that you instructed <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George
                            McGhee</persName> to acknowledge <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s letter (at Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">Not
                            printed. </note> and to say that you would need time to study it <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0474"/>before replying in detail. (Before
                        deciding on how to reply on offset, it made sense to see how the
                        Chancellor's rocky politics and economics shaped up.) </p>
                    <p>There is now a case for an extended answer, but your advisers differ on what
                        kind of a pitch we should make on offset, and what we should say about the
                        nuclear sharing/non-proliferation issue. The differences reflect basic
                        questions concerning our objectives in Europe which only you can decide. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issue No. 1: Nuclear Sharing vs. Non-proliferation </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s letter implicitly asks you to
                        reconfirm that we will not exclude “establishing in the future a joint
                        integrated nuclear force” in order to buy a non-proliferation agreement. A
                        full-dress reply which does not explicitly do that, would almost certainly
                        result in another <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> inquiry
                        within 48 hours. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, unless you have made up your mind to stay with the present
                        policy on non-proliferation, you will not want to repeat the assurance he
                        wants. You know the positions of your advisers on this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Rostow would vote for a strong reconfirmation of
                        our earlier position. (<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName> will file
                        his own views in detail.)<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">Not found. </note> I
                        do not know how Bob McNamara would vote. (In the past, he has been against
                        the so-called European clause, but not against keeping open the option of a
                        joint force with a U.S. veto.) Moyers <note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4"> Bill
                            Moyers, Special Assistant to the President. </note> and I would vote
                        against reconfirming the present position until you have decided whether to
                        test the Russians in Geneva (though Bill and I would differ somewhat on
                        tactics). My suggestion would be that we avoid this issue by not sending a
                        full, extended reply—except perhaps on offset—but rather a short note saying
                        that you plan to discuss the various points raised in <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s letter in September. </p>

                    <p>Avoid issue by not sending a full, point by point reply</p>
                    <p>Wait with the decision—and with any detailed reply until you, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Moyers and Rostow are all back in town and can

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issue No. 2: Offset </p>
                    <p>The tactical question is whether (1) to send Erhard a hard warning now that
                        we will have to cut back troops if he does not come through with a new 100%
                        offset deal (to follow the present one, which runs out in <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0475"/>June 1967); or (2) simply to ask Erhard not
                        to foreclose a renewal of the full offset before his September visit, and
                        ask him, in the interim, to explore with us and the British a modified
                        version of offset which would avoid the payments drain but give the Germans
                        some extra options (buying goods other than weapons, and perhaps even buying
                        long-term U.S. securities).</p>
                    <p>The tough language on offset at Tab B is <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            product,<note n="6" xml:id="d193fn6">Not printed. </note> which,
                        however, predated some of the recent evidence of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s political difficulties. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> still wants to go ahead with it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName> are against. I do not know
                        about Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The tactical issue hinges on a fundamental question
                        of our objectives: </p>
                    <p>1. Do we want to use financial pressure to maneuver the Germans into asking
                        us to cut troops? If this worked, it would permit us to shift to a more
                        economical military posture (dual basing, airlift, etc.), with minimum
                        resistance from the Chiefs and their allies on the Hill. </p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Or</hi>, do we prefer to try for an arrangement which
                        would: (i) give us the time needed to work out with the Germans and the UK
                        an agreed position on what kind of a reduction in U.S.-UK forces in Europe
                        would make sense in military terms; (ii) avoid large-scale U.S. troop cuts
                        during the interim (perhaps 2–3 years), and minimize British troop cuts;
                        (iii) still protect our balance of payments (though somewhat less so than
                        sharp troop cutbacks). </p>
                    <p>In general, sending a tough letter now along the lines of Tab B, corresponds
                        to the “get the Germans to invite us out” strategy. Sending a gentler one
                        fits with the second “trying to work it out” strategy. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Line-Up </p>
                    <p> Bob McNamara and Joe Fowler would vote for a tough letter. I would
                        surmise—you will want to get his views in person—that Bob believes the best
                        way out of big, unnecessary troop commitments in Europe is to insist on a
                        100% weapons-offset, regardless of German politics. This would maximize
                        pressure on the Germans to build up their forces (using weapons bought from
                        the U.S.). And if the heat gets too great, and Erhard refuses, we will have
                        set the stage for a cutback. </p>
                    <p>On tactics, Bob would argue that the only hope of getting to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in time to affect his '67 Defense
                        Budget is to hit him now. (If the economies the Chancellor plans are carried
                        out, it is clear that he will not have the money to keep offset at present
                        levels after June 1967, either for us or the UK.) </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>—and, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> believes, the Secretary—would vote for a gentler
                        letter. So would I. </p>
                    <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0476"/>
                    <p>—We do not believe there is an appreciable chance of getting Erhard to
                        increase his defense budget this summer. He is in the middle of a major
                        parliamentary fight for an anti-inflation/spending-reduction program. (By
                        next winter, if inflationary pressures ease, he will be in a much better
                        position to raise some extra money for defense.) </p>
                    <p>—More fundamentally, we believe that major shifts in U.S. security policy in
                        Europe should be based in the first instance on political/military factors.
                        To base such shifts on money would confirm the impression that NATO is
                        falling apart, that de Gaulle is right in saying that the British and
                        Americans are unreliable and care more for their pocketbooks than for the
                        safety of Europe. Further, unilateral U.S. troop cuts would reduce our
                        assets for an eventual mutual-withdrawal bargain with the Soviets. Most
                        important, it could seriously unsettle German politics—with unpredictable
                        results. (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is already in
                        trouble, mainly because of his inflation problem. Latest poll results show
                        his unqualified support down from 44% in April to 30% in July.) </p>
                    <p>There is no question that the gentler strategy would delay a shift to more
                        economical troop deployments, and it might bring on a tougher battle with
                        the Chiefs when we do shift later. But it would avoid the appearance of the
                        financial tail wagging the security dog, and avoid hitting <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> when he is down. Moreover, we do not
                        believe that the gentler strategy means giving up on a serious offset deal.
                        There are good alternatives to a straight weapons offset. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Additional <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName>
                            Comments</hi>. Underlying my own strong vote in favor of the softer
                        strategy are two further judgments: </p>
                    <p>1. If we are going to take risks with German politics, I would vote that we
                        do so in connection with nuclear-sharing/non-proliferation, rather than with
                        offset and U.S. forces in Europe. I do not believe we should risk
                        frustrating the Germans on both counts. Frustrating them on either one is
                            risky—<persName corresp="#p_BG4">George</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName> would say much too risky. I think it
                        worth trying to get Bonn to give up on hardware in order to test the
                        Russians on non-proliferation—though I would do it more slowly and gently
                        than I think Bill Moyers would. But I entirely share the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>-Rostow view that a harsh strategy on
                        both fronts would lead to really serious trouble in Germany. </p>
                    <p>2. It would be a very poor trade for us to take serious risks with the
                        stability of German and alliance politics, and hence with our security
                        position in Europe, in order to make marginal gains on our balance of
                        payments. Given time, I think the gentler <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>-Rostow-<persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName>
                        strategy would lead to a broader version of offset, good enough to protect
                        our balance of payments. But even if that is wrong, and the result is a
                        marginally greater balance of payments drain, that is a risk that, in my
                        judgment, is worth taking in order to protect our basic security and
                        political arrangements in Europe. </p>
                    <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0477"/>
                    <p>By taking more of a chance on our balance of payments—and on the UK balance
                        of payments, so as to hold the British in Europe and East of Suez—we very
                        marginally increase the chance that, in the end, we will face a run on gold.
                        As you know, I do not share the view that such a run would be the end of the
                        world—as long as it is not within a few months of an election. Far from it.
                        The present international money rules place a preposterous burden on the
                        U.S. By moving with speed and skill, following a stoppage of U.S. gold
                        sales, we could, within a few months, negotiate new rules which would make
                        far more sense all around. Because of our economic strength and trading
                        position, our negotiating leverage would be enormous. </p>
                    <p>This is not to recommend that we stop gold sales tomorrow. It does suggest
                        that we should not take serious risks with the stability of the Atlantic
                        security system, and the so far successful effort to build Germany into the

                    <p>Dear Mr. President: </p>
                    <p>Although the United States Embassy in Bonn has already been given a detailed
                        report on President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s visit
                        to Bonn<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visited Bonn on July
                            21. </note> I am anxious to give you my personal impressions. As you
                        know, I had two rather long talks alone with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, as well as a discussion in a
                        wider group. </p>
                    <p>We dealt with questions concerning his visit to the Soviet Union, the German
                        problem and European affairs. However, our exchange of view naturally
                        centered on the Atlantic Alliance and especially the consequences which
                        France's decision last March to withdraw her troops from NATO command has
                        for us all. On this point General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> said that France wanted to remain the ally of her
                        allies. Nor had he, he said, left any doubt in his discussions in the Soviet
                        Union that France will remain on the side of the West. She simply wanted to
                        withdraw from integration and wished to regain her complete freedom of
                        decision. She would, however, fulfill her commitments, especially those
                        flowing from Article 5 of <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0479"/>the North
                        Atlantic Treaty. France would fight on the side of her allies in the event
                        of an attack on a partner of the Alliance. President de Gaulle felt that in
                        order duly to prepare for any such joint operations, the French General
                        Staff should elaborate with the NATO-Headquarters plans for all conceivable
                        cases of possible military co-operation. Whilst confirming that these
                        problems would have to be resolved not bilaterally but within the framework
                        of the Alliance, he nevertheless repeatedly underlined the fact that the
                        decision regarding the use of French troops in an emergency would have to be
                        taken by the French Government. </p>
                    <p>As regards the presence of French troops in Germany, President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> repeatedly stressed that he would
                        leave French troops in Germany only if that was what we wanted. He would
                        withdraw them at any time we wished, whether now or later. On the matter of
                        the legal questions involved in the stationing of French troops in Germany,
                        we agreed to continue the negotiations already begun.</p>
                    <p>It was clear from our talks that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> rejects any automatic commitment in the event of
                        military operation, but he wishes to remain in the alliance of the free
                        nations of the West. On the other hand, he stated that he would in any event
                        leave his troops in Berlin, thus maintaining the joint responsibility for
                        Berlin. </p>
                    <p>On all these points I explained the German standpoint, with which you are
                        familiar, and again impressed upon President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> the reasons why we wish to preserve integration and
                        our close ties with the United States. To sum up I would say that our talks
                        helped to clarify our mutual positions, which, I hope, will have become even
                        more distinct by the time I come to Washington at the end of September. Then
                        we shall be able to discuss this matter thoroughly, and also any other
                        questions of particular interest to the United States and Germany. </p>
                    <p>May I say that I am very much looking forward to our meeting, and that my
                        thoughts are often with you in this troubled period you are going through. </p>
                    <p>With the expression of my high esteem,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            Belgian officials about the manner in which the relocation of SHAPE was
                            being handled, especially by the military. (Ibid.) </note> in which I
                        reported a conversation with PriMin Vanden Boeynants re SHAPE relocation. </p>
                    <p>2. In particular I wish to refer to Vanden Boeynants clear warning of serious
                        consequences should Belgium's allies support at govt level positions
                        expressed to date by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> and other
                        military officials and which in Belgian eyes are not essentially based on
                        military considerations. </p>
                    <p>3. I also wish to highlight PriMin's statement to me that he and Belgian
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>, in conversation held in
                        PriMin's office on Saturday, June 4, had clearly and unequivocally informed
                        NATO Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that
                        while Belgium willing to host SHAPE, Brussels and immediate Brussels area
                        would be excluded as relocation site. </p>
                    <p>4. I believe the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> can be faulted for not
                        having offered more than one site for SHAPE and for having demonstrated a
                        rigidity, and perhaps an inordinate stubbornness, following early reports of
                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s dissatisfaction with Casteau
                        site. The Belgians likewise have, I think, tended to minimize communications
                        problems related to the establishment of SHAPE in the Casteau area, and not
                        adequately to recognize this as a valid military consideration. I understand
                        de Kerchove in his discussions at Paris today will indicate that the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> would be prepared to offer a second site
                        but that this could not be in the Brussels or other urban areas. If, in
                        fact, the Belgians do put forward an alternative site to Casteau, I believe
                        it would be out of recognition that their position has been unduly rigid. </p>
                    <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0481"/>
                    <p>5. I might add that, in my view, the rigidity which Belgium has shown in
                        sticking thus far to the Casteau site for SHAPE can to a degree be related
                        to a feeling within the govt that its views on the location of other
                        headquarters (<gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss>) are not being given serious
                        consideration. They believe events are justifying their fear that the
                        military preference will in each case be supported from the political side. </p>
                    <p>6. What I do not quite understand are the suggestions emanating from meetings
                        in Paris that, in refusing to agree to a location for SHAPE in the Brussels
                        area, the Belgians are in some way guilty of bad faith and are being
                        arbitrary and politically weak-kneed. The PriMin's unequivocal statement to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> should have made clear to
                        all concerned that the Brussels area was out. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> made this point also in
                        reporting to Parliament following the June <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Ministerial on Belgian agreement to host SHAPE. The Embassy
                        has consistently reported this as a fact of life here. </p>

                    <p>(The President met with Prime Minister Pearson on the occasion of his
                        participation in a cornerstone laying ceremony at the Roosevelt Campobello
                            <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0482"/>International Park on
                        Campobello Island, New Brunswick. He was the luncheon guest of the Prime
                        Minister at Rossmount Inn in the little town of Chamcook, N.B. The lunch was
                        preceded by approximately an hour and a half of serious conversation in a
                        parlor of the Inn set aside for the purpose.)</p>
                    <p>At one point in the conversation, the Prime Minister asked the President how
                        he was handling DeGaulle, to which the President responded with a smile, “I
                        get out of the box when he starts winding up. I'm betting on outliving him.” </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister commented that Canada was anxious that nothing be done
                        which will make more difficult the ultimate establishment of better
                        relations with France. </p>
                    <p>The President responded that he himself had been very careful never to
                        respond in kind to DeGaulle. In fact he had never said one unkind word about
                        DeGaulle and he stopped American bureaucrats from doing so whenever he
                        caught them. He added, however, that when we are told to get out, we simply
                        have to get out. </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister agreed, noting that this had been particularly hard for
                        the Canadians to swallow, especially since Canadian forces would be moving
                        to Germany. The special historic relationship which the Canadian nation had
                        with France and the memories of Canadian involvement in the two wars against
                        Germany made this an especially hard blow. Nevertheless, emotion was no
                        basis for policy, although at one point he had not resisted the temptation
                        to say to the French, “Do you want us to move out our hundred thousand dead,
                        too?” In sum, the Canadian Government believes we should not make it easy
                        for the French to pull out of NATO.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that he could understand and appreciate the special
                        feeling Canada had for France. </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that, looking to the future, he believed
                        the Europeans should do more themselves. They should carry a greater share
                        of the burden of their own defense. </p>
                    <p>The President did not take direct issue with the Prime Minister's
                        observation, but asked who among the Europeans will do more? <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>? <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>? The Italians? They simply won't. What worried him
                        most is that we might do less and they won't do more. This would be
                        frightening because, by tempting the aggressor, we could cause World War
                        III. In any event, he was not going to try to dominate the Alliance. </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister responded that he had not been suggesting that the US
                        should pull out wholesale. He noted that Canada had had an opportunity to
                        pull out when the French had asked them to leave France, but the Canadians
                        had resisted this temptation. He was only suggesting that the British, for
                        example, could involve themselves more in the <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0483"/>defense of Europe and ought to give up trying to play the
                        role of nineteenth century imperialists. </p>

                            Forces in Germany </item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">We need your instructions on two related issues: </p>
                    <p>1. What should we do to dissuade the British from rushing ahead with sharp
                        cuts in their forces in Germany (men and stocks) in a way which would
                        probably start an unravelling process in NATO and increase domestic pressure
                        on us to follow suit? (So far, our stance vis-a-vis the British has been:
                        (i) you must not cut; (ii) we wish you luck with your offset with the
                        Germans.) </p>
                    <p>2. What should we do about our own offset with the Germans? The present
                        arrangement runs out in June 1967. We owe Erhard replies to his recent
                        letter on his talk with DeGaulle,<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">
                            <ref target="#d190">See Document 190</ref>.</note> and also to his
                        earlier letter which asks that we not connect troops and offset, and that
                        payments for other than weapons be counted.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">Dated July 5. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 67
                            D 272) </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(If we send <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> a <hi rend="italic">full</hi> reply, you will also need to decide how to respond to his
                        implicit request for a new U.S. pledge that we will not exclude
                        “establishing in the future a joint integrated nuclear force” in order to
                        buy a non-proliferation treaty. A full-dress reply which does not explicitly
                        give him that reassurance would almost certainly result in another inquiry
                        within 48 hours.) </p>
                    <p rend="center">Issue No. 1: What do we do to slow down British troop cuts? </p>
                    <p>There is agreement among your advisers that it would be useful: </p>
                    <p>—for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and <persName>Cy
                            Vance</persName> to go to London later this week to make the case
                        against hasty cuts; </p>
                    <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>—perhaps to offer marginally to increase our stationing expenditures and
                        weapons purchases; </p>
                    <p>—offer to join the UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “mixed commission”
                        of foreign/defense/finance ministers which is supposed to prepare a report
                        on UK troops and offset. </p>
                    <p>Hopefully, the above steps will delay a final decision on UK cutbacks at
                        least for the next several weeks. And they could be used to rebut newspaper
                        talk that an unravelling of NATO is certain and imminent. But they are a
                        stopgap. If we are to stop the unravelling, the key lies in our management
                        of our offset issue. </p>
                    <p rend="center">Issue No. 2: The U.S. Offset </p>
                    <p>Specifically, are we willing to change our “no weapons offset/no troops”
                        tactics and offer to: </p>
                    <p>—put our offset renewal on the agenda of the “mixed commission?” (An offer to
                        join to discuss only the UK offset is likely to be regarded as patronizing
                        rather than helpful.) </p>
                    <p>—explore with the UK and the Germans a modified version of offset which would
                        protect our payments but give the Germans some extra options (buying extra
                        goods other than weapons, and, most important, buying long-term
                        “offset-bonds”, perhaps in the context of some multilateral defense payments
                        arrangement)? </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The tactical issue hinges on our choice of
                        objectives: </p>
                    <p>1. Do we want to use financial pressure to maneuver the Germans into asking
                        us to cut troops? If this worked, it would permit us to shift to a more
                        economical military posture (dual basing, airlifts, etc.), with minimum
                        resistance from the Chiefs and their allies on the Hill. </p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Or</hi>, do we want to try for an arrangement which
                        would (i) give us time to work out a US-UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> bargain on cheaper deployments (and perhaps <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> increases) which make military sense; (ii)
                        avoid large-scale U.S. troop cuts during the interim (perhaps 2–3 years),
                        and minimize British troop cuts; (iii) still protect our balance of payments
                        (though somewhat less so than would sharp troop cutbacks); (iv) set up a
                        multilateral defense payments club where finance ministers will confront
                        foreign and defense ministers on a regular basis. (This would partially
                        bridge the unhealthy gap in Europe between people responsible for money and
                        those responsible for defense and foreign relations.) </p>
                    <p>In general, staying with our present tactic of threatening to cut back troops
                        if the Germans don't come through with a new 100% weapons offset corresponds
                        to the “get the Germans to invite us out” objective. </p>
                    <p>Putting our offset on the agenda of the mixed commission and offering to
                        explore a multilateral offset arrangement, with more options for the
                        Germans, corresponds to the second “trying to work it out” objective. </p>
                    <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0485"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Case for Staying with the Present Tactics: </p>
                    <p>The quickest way to cut unnecessary U.S. troops in Europe is to insist on
                        100% weapons offset, regardless of German politics. This would maximize
                        pressure on the Germans to build up their forces, using weapons bought from
                        the U.S. And if the heat gets too great, and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> refuses to renew the offset at the current level—as
                        is now almost certain—we will have set the stage for a cutback. This would
                        enable us to shift to a more sensible military posture, save us budget
                        money, and protect the balance of payments. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Case Against Present Tactics: </p>
                    <p>In achieving the above objectives, the current line will maximize the
                        international political costs: </p>
                    <p>—The Germans will not agree to another 100% weapons offset at the present
                        levels. If we make the threat, we will have to carry it out or back down.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is in political trouble.
                        The latest polls show his unqualified support down from 44% in April to 30%
                        in July. He is not going to be able to pull apart his anti-inflation package
                        in the middle of a tough parliamentary fight to increase his defense budget
                        enough to cover a 100% weapons offset.) </p>
                    <p>—U.S. troop cuts, explicitly for financial reasons—and on top of <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> cuts—will be seen as evidence that NATO
                        is falling apart and that deGaulle is right in saying that the British and
                        Americans care more for their pocketbooks than for the safety of Europe. </p>
                    <p>—We will have given away some of our assets for an eventual mutual withdrawal
                        bargain with the Soviets. </p>
                    <p>—Most important, there would be a serious unsettling effect on German
                        politics, with unpredictable results. (It is not at all inconceivable that
                        peremptory U.S. cutbacks could topple <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, perhaps leading to a Gaullist German Government.) </p>
                    <p>—Over a couple of years, we could be faced with a disintegration of our
                        postwar security arrangements in Europe, a hostile France, an alienated and
                        deeply neurotic Germany, a bankrupt and isolated Britain, and a rising tide
                        of Gaullist hostility to the U.S. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Possible Way Out: </p>
                    <p>There is a <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> chance that we could shift to
                        more economical deployments and provide acceptable protection for our
                        balance of payments <hi rend="italic">without taking such large political
                            risks</hi>. The key lies in taking the time needed to make the shift by
                        consensus rather than fiat. To achieve this, we need to set in motion a
                        process designed to produce U.S.-UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        agreement on an allied defense posture in Europe which will provide
                        deterrence and the insurance of a reasonable conventional option. Our
                        joining the “mixed commission” would be a very good start. </p>
                    <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0486"/>
                    <p>At the same time, we will continue to need balance of payments protection.
                        For the time being at least, that means no sharp cut in German offset money.
                        The key to that—at least a necessary condition—is to give the Germans more
                        options—enlarge the number of ways in which they can provide offset. This
                        does not mean that we should reduce our pressure on them to buy weapons—for
                        good military reasons. It does mean that, in addition, we must find ways to
                        ease the political strain on <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> of
                        raising offset money (e.g., allow the Germans to purchase long-term offset
                        bonds, perhaps financed outside their budget). In my judgment, the
                        multilateral payments union proposal, which has been in staff preparation
                        for some time, is the most promising possibility. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Procedure</p>
                    <p>Before making up your mind, you will wish to hear the views of all your
                        advisers. (In the past, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                        been in favor of staying with our present hard line on offset. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> has been for a shift. I do not know
                        about Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.) </p>
                    <p>As is clear from the above, my own vote would be for a shift in tactics to
                        the second, “trying to work it out” option. If you should decide that way,
                        you might wish, at the end of the meeting this afternoon, to instruct us as
                        follows: </p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> should go to London and tell the
                        British that we are prepared: </p>
                    <p>—to join the “Mixed Commission”; </p>
                    <p>—to put <hi rend="italic">our</hi> offset renewal on the agenda; </p>
                    <p>—to try to work out with them and the Germans a scheme which will enlarge the
                        ways in which the Germans can provide offset, yet protect both UK and US
                        payments. </p>
                    <p>2. We prepare a letter from you to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, thanking him for his report on DeGaulle and, on
                        offset, telling him the same things <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> will say
                        to the British. (We could say nothing about nuclear
                        sharing/nonproliferation, and say that you plan to discuss all other
                        outstanding issues when he is here in September. Or, if you have so decided,
                        we can give him the reassurance he wants. This would tend to lock us in on
                        nonproliferation.) </p>
                    <p>3. A group consisting of Deming, <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>/Enthoven, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> should get to work on a
                        multilateral payments plan which would both widen the Germans' options and
                        protect U.S. and UK payments. This group should initially report to
                        Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>

                    <p>I have become increasingly concerned during the past few weeks about the
                        dangers of an unraveling in NATO which could easily get out of hand. With
                        your urgent need to save foreign exchange in Germany, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s budgetary and political
                        difficulties (not to speak of his problems with his brass), my problems with
                        our German offset and with the Congress on troops in Europe—all against the
                        background of the General's antics—there is danger of serious damage to the
                        security arrangements we have worked so hard to construct during the last 20
                        years. To you, I don't have to spell out the possible political
                        consequences, especially in Germany. And while I would not think it likely
                        that our Russian friends will develop itchy fingers, one cannot rule it out.
                        In any case, it would be foolish to run down our assets vis-a-vis Moscow
                        without some quid-pro-quo. </p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the essential step, if we are to hold things together,
                        would be for you, the Germans, and ourselves to get to work immediately to
                        find a solution that would be equitable, meet our respective political
                        requirements, and fully cover the defense needs of the Alliance. I propose
                        to write to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> this afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">The message to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was actually sent on August 25. (Ibid.)
                        </note>—before his budget meeting tomorrow—to suggest that the U.S. join the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the UK in an initial exploration
                        of this entire range of issues: force levels, deployments and the sharing of
                        the foreign exchange burden. I would think that such an exploration should
                        involve our Ministers of Finance, as well as of Foreign Affairs and Defense.
                        And, of course, it would have to be followed by thorough consultation with
                        all our Allies in NATO.</p>
                    <p>I know that not all of your decisions can await the outcome of such a
                        tripartite exercise. But I very much hope—and I will put this hard to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in connection with his
                        budget—that we will all try to avoid any decisions during the next several
                        weeks which would unduly narrow our choices. </p>

                        nonpolitical speech making in the West, I hope to spend Saturday and Sunday

                            Because of his “major concern” to safeguard sterling, however, he wanted
                            to reach an agreed Anglo-American position so the Germans could not play
                            one country off against the other. (Ibid.) </note>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Senator Kuchel:</p>
                    <p>I had a good personal talk with Senator Kuchel this morning regarding the
                        Mansfield resolution, explaining that we had not been consulted on its
                        contents, timing, or indeed its introduction on the floor of the Senate. I
                        said the resolution was a very bad one and would create major problems for
                        us in NATO which was already suffering from General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s withdrawal. Furthermore, it
                        would cause difficult problems for Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> who would be visiting the US later this month. I
                        explained that for several months at closed NATO meetings, you and <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0489"/>other US representatives have been
                        stressing the theme that there cannot be a double standard whereby the US is
                        expected to meet agreed force goals but other NATO members need not meet
                        theirs. The introduction of this resolution would most certainly be
                        exploited by the Gaullists to prove their contention that the US was not
                        dependable and also lead to charges of unilateral US action that further
                        undermined NATO. Finally, the resolution would not be a helpful backdrop for
                        the talks you would be having with Gromyko in New York later this month at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">At his September 8 press conference, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> addressed the
                            question of troop strength in Europe, saying that he was aware of the
                            sense of the Senate on this issue, but that it could not be solved by
                            Senate resolutions. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents
                                of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                    </p>
                    <p>With respect to Senator Mansfield's suggestion that the resolution be put on
                        the consent calendar with no committee hearings, I pointed out that the
                        April 1951 resolution, calling for the sending of troops to Europe,<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">S. Res. 99, 82d Congress. </note> had been
                        considered by the Senate Armed Services Committee and that there were over
                        800 pages of published testimony of those Committee hearings. I summarized
                        by saying that the resolution was damaging to US national interests. While
                        under any circumstances it would be damaging because of its timing, the
                        resolution was even more harmful because it made absolutely no reference to
                        NATO consultations or to a reciprocal reduction of forces by the Soviet
                        Union in Eastern Europe. </p>
                    <p>Senator Kuchel said he agreed and did not like the resolution. He thought it
                        absurd that the sponsors had not mentioned NATO consultation and also
                        required the Soviet Union to reciprocate by reducing their forces in Eastern
                        Europe. He said that while the Department might not have been notified by
                        Mansfield, he had assumed from what Mansfield said while introducing the
                        resolution that the President had been fully consulted and had not
                        disapproved. I said that while I could not undertake to speak for the
                        President, I personally felt certain that the President had not been
                        consulted on the contents or the timing of the introduction of the
                        resolution. </p>
                    <p>Senator Kuchel said that it was also absurd for the sponsors to ask that the
                        resolution be put on the consent calendar. It was particularly nonsensical
                        to suggest that this resolution, which was one of great import, did not need
                        to be examined by committee when as a general practice the Senate referred
                        the most trivial resolutions to committee and the original 1951 resolution
                        had been thoroughly aired in committee. </p>
                    <p>The Senator said he wanted to help and asked whether on a personal and
                        private basis there were any Administration papers or remarks that I could
                        pass to him without attribution. I replied that my conversation <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0490"/>with him was personal and that while there
                        were no papers that I could give him, I did want him to know our views
                        because of the serious damage to our national interests that passage of the
                        resolution might entail. </p>
                    <p>Senator Kuchel said he fully understood and appreciated very much my call. He
                        was determined to see the resolution be sent to committee and he would try
                        to be helpful in defeating or modifying it. He suggested that we have
                        another talk the middle of next week if there were any new developments. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Senator Dirksen:</p>
                    <p>I also talked to Senator Dirksen along the same lines as I had talked to
                        Senator Kuchel, stressing the damage that the resolution could do in our
                        relations with NATO and the Germans and the comfort it could give to the
                        Soviet Union which would not fail to exploit it along with other elements
                        unfriendly to the US such as the Gaullists. Senator Dirksen said he agreed.
                        He had met with his Republican colleagues this morning on this subject and
                        enjoined them “to stay off this resolution” and not to hold any press
                        conferences on the subject. He would renew this advice. </p>

                    <p>I fully understand your anxiety to complete the steps necessary to deal with
                        your balance of payments problem. We put the safeguards of Sterling high on
                        our list of priorities and, as you know, I admire the sturdy measures you
                        have taken so far to put your house in good order. </p>
                    <p>Yet, as we have found out in this country, steps to stop the outflow of
                        foreign exchange must always be measured against the cost in terms of
                        defense and foreign policy. Thus, I am concerned that the proposals you are
                        considering with respect to the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> be
                        carefully handled or they may start the unravelling of our Western defenses.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s abrupt action in
                        pulling his own forces out of NATO was a brutal blow at the solidarity of
                        the Alliance, and there could be great danger from further withdrawals that
                        are not related to a common plan. </p>

                    <p>Above all, we must avoid any actions that might tend to make the Germans feel
                        they were not full partners on the team. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is in deep trouble and the political situation in
                        Germany today is anything but healthy. It is essential to both our countries
                        that we show sensitivity to German opinion which seems more and more
                        confused and apprehensive. For that reason I would think it unwise for us to
                        hold bilateral talks in advance that might lead the Germans to believe that
                        we were preparing a fait accompli. Of course, during the tripartite talks
                        there will naturally be bilateral exchanges among those taking part, and we
                        will be ready for such talks at the earliest feasible time.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">On September 7, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> talked with high-ranking officials in London and

                    <p>2767. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subject: The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position on French troops in
                        Germany—political aspects. </p>
                    <p>1. In the forthcoming meeting between the President and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, the multilateral issue of the role
                        and mission of French troops in Germany will undoubtedly be at the center of
                        the discussions about the future of NATO. Since April the U.S. position on
                        French troops has been tailored to that of the Germans. </p>
                    <p>We have supported them in the clear stand outlined in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> declaration of April 6, the German
                        aide-memoire to the French of May 3 and <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0492"/>the May report of the Trilateral Working Group. Since
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s visit to Bonn in
                        July, however, German support for this position has come increasingly into
                        question. </p>
                    <p>2. As I understand it indirectly from his Ministers, the Chancellor considers
                        that he made no concession to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> on the mission of the French during <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s visit. He believes he made it
                        clear that this was to be left for determination by the Fourteen and France.
                        No one whom I talked with, however, was present at the private meeting
                        between <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and there is presumably no
                        record. The fact is that regardless of what <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> thinks he did or did not say, his own statements at
                        the time of his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, as amplified by his chief press spokesman, provided a
                        solid basis for the French interpretation that the troop issue was in effect
                        settled at that meeting. The German press virtually unanimously reached the
                        same conclusion. The public impression of the outcome of the
                        meeting—especially since it has gone unchallenged for weeks—is probably as
                        important in shaping the final German position as are the Chancellor's
                        second thoughts in private about what he did at the meeting, or what
                            <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> can do to convince him
                        to take a strong position on the mission of French forces in the future. </p>
                    <p>3. Nor was the important change in the German position at the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> meeting solely a question of atmospherics. All parties
                        here agree that the bilateral issues involving the status of the French
                        forces have ceased to be an obstacle to their continued presence. Perhaps
                        more important, the German Government formally and publicly established
                        another basic reason in addition to the military one for the continued
                        presence of the forces; namely, because they serve as a symbol of close
                        Franco-German political cooperation. The pre-eminence accorded to this
                        political reason for the French presence, and the scant attention paid to
                        the military mission of the forces, has had the clear practical effect of
                        subordinating the military aspects of the issue to the political.</p>
                    <p>4. This development represents a clear victory over the FonMin for those
                        within the <gloss target="#t_CDUCSU1">CDU/CSU</gloss> who are against a hard
                        line toward France. The turning point came in a party meeting on July 18,
                        called by <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at the initiative of
                        Strauss. At that meeting Barzel, Heck, Gerstenmaier and Krone reportedly
                        gave strong support to Strauss' insistence on a retreat from the <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> position, and won the Chancellor
                        over. </p>
                    <p>5. Carstens had told me (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2369)<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Not found. </note> that he is confident the
                        instructions the Chancellor would give <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> on the military aspects of the French troop
                        presence in the multilateral negotiations in Paris would make a firm stand
                        possible. He did not, however, give me the impression that he really
                        believed this. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> was able to
                        get from <persName corresp="#p_EL1">
                            <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0493"/>Erhard</persName> in April the
                        kind of instructions he desires—only to have the Chancellor abandon them
                        suddenly in mid-July. It seems doubtful that Schroeder would be willing to
                        jeopardize further his own position in view of the risk he would run of
                        suffering a second reversal at the hands of Strauss and a clear majority of
                        the most influential leaders of the party. The Chancellor is even weaker now
                        politically than he was in mid-July. Von Hassel, who was never more than a
                        lukewarm supporter of Schroeder on the French troop issue, is now largely
                        neutralized by grave troubles of his own and also seems (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2591)/2/ to have weakened on the
                        troop issue. All these considerations would seem to argue against <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> making a determined fight for a
                        firm line. </p>
                    <p>6. It can be argued that the Germans may be willing to take a firmer stand in
                        the multilateral deliberations on the military mission of the French forces
                        than they did on those questions on which they had to confront the French
                        alone, especially if the rest of the Fourteen stand firm. In the last
                        analysis, however, even the multilateral issue becomes more of a bilateral
                        one. French troops are in Germany, where they have been for twenty years. If
                        they fought it would, in the first instance, be in the defense of Germany.
                        Moreover, the sole effective sanction for French noncompliance with Allied
                        wishes on the troop issue—a notice of eviction—can only be imposed by the
                        Germans. This will doubtless already have occurred to the German Government.
                        I consider it interesting that even while Carstens tells me (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2369) that the German position on the
                        multilateral issue remains unchanged, he is already preparing a fall-back
                        position on the question of political vs. military negotiations. </p>
                    <p>7. I conclude that the German Government does not have the strength for a
                        hard confrontation with France on the issue of French troops in Germany.
                        With the issues of status of forces and of French air and air defense units
                        now largely removed from the arena, the main point to be resolved is the
                        mission for the French ground forces in reserve. This does not, in German
                        thinking, pose any great problem. I believe, therefore, that the FRG may
                        seek ways to retire as gracefully as possible from its position concerning
                        the military mission of these forces. In the end it may be prepared to
                        settle for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s general
                        assurances—already given to them very forcefully—that France will honor its
                        Article V commitment. </p>
                    <p>8. On the assumption that this problem will not be tackled meaningfully by
                        the Fourteen before the Chancellor goes to Washington and that we still
                        attach importance to a clear definition of French roles and mission, the
                        question arises as to what can be done in the light of the above. I myself
                        doubt that we can persuade the Chancellor to adhere to his firm policy of
                        April and May. If we tried this course and won out we <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0494"/>would, I believe, be subjecting both Erhard
                        and ourselves to grave risks. We might in such case well have to bear the
                        responsibility for causing the withdrawal of French troops from Germany—or
                        Ehrard's demise as Chancellor. If we lost, our standing as the leader of the
                        Alliance would be adversely affected. </p>
                    <p>9. I conclude that we should stick to the line of action we initiated in
                        March; that is, we should not get out in front of the Germans on the issue
                        of French troops. In talking to Erhard and <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, we can re-emphasize the importance of firm
                        policy. However, we should also state that we will defer to their judgment,
                        the final analysis we consider the problem to be primarily a German one. </p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>Thank your very much for your letter of 25 August 1966.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">
                            <ref target="#d198fn2">See footnote 2, Document 198</ref>.</note> I have
                        noted with great interest your proposal that the problem of the armed
                        forces, deployment and sharing of the foreign exchange burden, which will
                        have to be met from the middle of next year, be examined at a conference of
                        the Ministers of Foreign Affaires, Defence and Finance of the United States,
                        Germany and Great Britain. I, too, am greatly concerned about this and
                        connected political and military problems. They are of considerable
                        importance to the Alliance, whose preservation and consolidation is the
                        common aim of our two governments. </p>
                    <p>In any event the conference you proposed will have to be thoroughly prepared
                        and its possible effect on the Alliance carefully examined. I suggest that,
                        during my forthcoming visit to Washington, we include your proposal in a
                        comprehensive discussion of the future of the Alliance and long-term
                        planning for the defence of Europe. </p>
                    <p>The proposals to be submitted by the Anglo-German mixed commission, whose
                        work will conclude in mid-October with a meeting of the competent German and
                        British Ministers, will also have a bearing on the solution to the problem
                        of off-setting the foreign exchange cost of Allied <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"/>troops stationed on the continent, and

                            September 8 (received in the Department of State early in the morning of
                            September 8) reported that <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> showed no sense of urgency with regard to
                            trilateral talks and still preferred to postpone them until after

                            the end of the month. (Ibid.) The telephone conversation has not been

                            <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> discloses appalling lack
                        of understanding of problems raised by proposed British action. Germans must
                        be made to understand in unequivocal terms that unless we act immediately in
                        concert with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> the British will be
                        irrevocably set on a course of conduct that will result in substantial
                        withdrawals from the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>. The result would
                        put enormous pressure on the United States to make corresponding withdrawals
                        and a process of unravelling can be started, with critical consequences. </p>
                    <p>It is totally unrealistic to postpone starting these discussions until after
                        the Chancellor's visit since the pressure for action in Britain due to
                        instability of sterling cannot be dealt with in a leisurely fashion. The
                        British have now agreed to participate in trilateral talks on the condition
                        that they be held immediately (i.e. next week) so as not to postpone the
                        target date of October 13 for completion of the work of the Anglo-German
                        Commission, by which date they are determined to have “results.” </p>
                    <p>The US has proposed trilateral talks not for the purpose of “ganging up” on
                        Germans but because offset and force level (including logistic <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0496"/>backup) questions can no longer be
                        considered separately or bilaterally. Re “ganging up” argument you should
                        note we have already suggested to British they should take account of some
                        $20 million annually of balance of payments savings they will obtain through
                        transfer of US air squadrons from France to UK and reduce their German
                        offset demands by that amount. Conceivably similar savings could be found.
                        It would be our strong hope that out of trilateral discussions practical
                        arrangements can be worked out on both questions of finance and force levels
                        which will be acceptable to all three countries and preserve essential NATO
                        security requirements which we are convinced will otherwise be endangered.
                        The US is prepared to come to trilateral talks with suggestions for
                        consideration to accomplish this end result. NATO would of course be
                        consulted on any force level questions but it is of utmost importance that
                        three countries be in agreement on them. </p>
                    <p>Accordingly, you should in your forthcoming talk with Erhard do your best to
                        persuade him to agree to commencement of trilateral talks next week in view
                        of serious dangers which would result from delay.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">On September 9, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> reported that after 1–1/2 hours of “hard

                        France-NATO—The Constitutional Question. We agree fully with your
                        proposition that it would not be productive to seek early consensus among
                        Allies on future form of <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0497"/>France's
                        relationship to NATO and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. As you rightly
                        put it, that relationship will evolve as sum of series of decisions,
                        agreements and disagreements over coming months. </p>
                    <p>At this stage it is not clear what would be most advantageous form for a
                        continuing relationship. In meantime we do not want US to become involved in
                        either stirring up others or working toward crystallization in formal
                        relationship between Fourteen and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.
                        Formalizing a new definition of relationship between France and NATO would
                        be out of question in near future and we think for December Ministerial
                        Meeting. </p>
                    <p>Primary factor of importance is to maintain formula for relationship which
                        emerged from Brussels, i.e. Ministers “assume that France does not claim the
                        right to call in question decisions on policies on which she has renounced
                        participation.” Precedent exists in way <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        has functioned, with Iceland totally quiet on many matters because it makes
                        no military contribution and indeed Luxembourg saying little because of its
                        very limited area of activity. France is effectively moving toward role
                        rather like Iceland. Since she seems to be moving to limit herself, there is
                        no reason for us to push. </p>
                    <p>It is premature to try to draw distinctions about future constitutional role
                        of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Treaty says it is established “to
                        consider matters concerning the implementation” of the Treaty without
                        limitations on its competence. Fourteen is ad hoc group and remains to be
                        seen what will be its continuing role and whether or not it is transitory.
                        We welcome fact that Brosio has assumed chair of Fourteen and that France
                        has withdrawn from Military Committee. Both developments will contribute to
                        more businesslike conduct of NATO affairs. In course of that process
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and PermReps of Fourteen
                        will need to be on guard to ensure in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        and other areas of common activity that France participates, is silent, or
                        absents itself as its own activities make appropriate, but it should not be
                        accepted that France could block NATO business in which it does not
                        participate. </p>
                    <p>In short we would like to let matters develop further before we try to
                        foreshadow long-term constitutional changes such as having Fourteen meet
                        regularly as the Council on military questions. Needless to say we should
                        continue to give internal consideration to this important problem. </p>

                            found. </note> the Secretary raised the issue of the relocation of
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. The Secretary recalled that at the
                        Brussels Meeting he had expressed a strong preference for keeping <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and SHAPE together. Since then the attitude
                        of the French towards NATO has been clarified in many directions: they have
                        withdrawn support of military budgets;<note n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">On
                            September 7, de Leusse announced that France would contribute to the
                            NATO general military budget. (Telegram 3123 from Paris, September 7;
                            Department of State, Central Files, NATO 6–2 FR)</note> they have placed
                        severe limits on coordinating policy on French troops in Germany; they have
                        stated that not one ton of NATO supplies is to remain in France; they have
                        given no assurance that the pipeline can continue to function. The basic
                        explanation for this attitude would appear to be that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wants to be able to stand aside
                        from NATO in the event of a crisis. Should this happen and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> remain in Paris, this could be embarrassing
                        to the French and cause difficulties for NATO. On balance, therefore, the
                        Secretary favors moving <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> out <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0499"/>of Paris. The Secretary suggested that such
                        a decision might be taken by the PermReps, obviating the need for a Foreign
                        Ministers Meeting. The Secretary stated he would discuss the matter with the
                        Canadian and Danish Foreign Ministers and explore if a consensus exists. It
                        is preferable that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> move of its own
                        volition rather than be thrown out. </p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> stated in reply that
                        he had never questioned the need for SHAPE and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to be located together. He had merely wanted to defer the
                        decision in order not to cause bitterness on the part of the French. This,
                        however, was now a thing of the past. As to procedure, he recalled that he
                        had sent a telegram to Paris suggesting that the 14 Standing Members
                        continue to meet and decide on a proposal to submit to the Ministers. While
                        Italy would not object if the 14 PermReps were to take the matter into their
                        own hands, Fanfani emphasized that once the decision to move had been taken,
                        the Allies should get out of Paris promptly, preferably before December.

                    <p>After a lengthy discussion of Viet Nam (separate Memcon), Rapacki said that
                        he would like to discuss the question of European security. He referred to
                        recent press articles which argued that the reduction of the U.S. presence
                        in Europe “to unknown limits” as a result of events in Southeast Asia would
                        be welcomed by the Socialist countries. According to Rapacki, the writers of
                        these articles must feel that the Socialist countries <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0500"/>are “politically naive” and he stated that
                        Poland is interested in “constructive” United States influence in promoting
                        the peaceful development of Europe. He asked, rhetorically, how long the
                        European situation could remain isolated from the world-wide trend toward
                        increasing tensions. He observed that the relatively calm conditions in
                        Europe were deceptive and could not last. According to Rapacki, the
                        Southeast Asian situation could well have an adverse effect on conditions in
                        Europe and, furthermore, none of the real dangers for European stability had
                        been removed. In this regard, Rapacki repeated the traditional Polish charge
                        that revanchist elements in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are
                        gaining strength and are showing an increasing desire for nuclear weapons to
                        use in pressuring the “German Democratic Republic” and forcing a revision of
                        European frontiers. In his only comment during the meeting, Winiewicz
                        observed that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wishes to “swallow”
                        the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.” Rapacki stated that collective
                        security measures are necessary to avert the danger posed by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the United States has a role to play in
                        these efforts. </p>
                    <p> Rapacki referred to Poland's 1964 proposal for a European Security
                            Conference<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">Presumably reference is to the
                            Gomulka Plan of December 28, 1963. </note> and said that intensive
                        contacts with countries in both Eastern and Western Europe had led to some
                        progress toward holding such a Conference. According to Rapacki, the
                        Europeans generally agree that a Conference would be useful, but he
                        acknowledged that much preparatory work was necessary. In his view, the
                        Conference would consider the basic question of guaranteeing the security of
                        individual states. With this obstacle out of the way, increased economic
                        cooperation among European states would develop naturally. Political
                        questions would be taken up only at the end of the process of normalization.
                        Rapacki stressed the importance of European and world-wide non-proliferation
                        agreements in ensuring peace. He mentioned the problem of NATO consultation
                        on nuclear weapons and said that Poland was particularly concerned that
                        these consultations should not lead to giving non-nuclear powers a voice in
                        the use of nuclear weapons. He also emphasized Poland's interest in the
                        reduction of conventional forces and suggested that a collective
                        renunciation of the use of force in changing the status quo would be useful. </p>
                    <p>In reply, the Secretary stressed that the United States was “utterly and
                        completely” opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He cited our
                        refusal to assist the French nuclear weapons program, with its consequences
                        for US-French relations, as proof of our determination not to transfer
                        nuclear weapons or technology. The Secretary pointed out, however, that the
                        Warsaw Pact could not have a seat at the NATO table with a veto over NATO
                        matters. When Rapacki expressed surprise at this <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0501"/>statement, the Secretary said that some of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s objections to NATO procedures
                        appeared to require a veto over NATO decisions. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the United States welcomed increased East-West
                        contacts and informed Rapacki that the Administration planned to reintroduce
                        the East-West trade bill early in 1967. He observed that the question of
                        holding a European Security Conference was well worth discussing and
                        stressed that the United States must be present when the great political
                        problems of Central Europe are discussed. Rapacki asked whether the United
                        States was really interested in these problems and said that our lack of
                        interest in the Polish proposal for a Conference indicated that we were not.
                        The Secretary pointed to our involvement in two world wars which originated
                        in Central Europe as proof of our interest. He said that extensive
                        preparations were required before a European Security Conference could be
                        held since a conference which fails is worse than no conference. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed an interest in discussing this and other questions
                        with Rapacki if time permitted before his return to Poland. Rapacki said
                        that he planned to remain in New York through October 4 or 5 but that
                        Winiewicz planned to stay somewhat longer. </p>

                    <p>The President welcomed the Chancellor and suggested the Chancellor give him a
                        summary of his thoughts to begin the conversation. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor started out by saying the two were meeting at a difficult time
                        in the world. There was much uncertainty. He and the President <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0502"/>were personally involved in many
                        difficulties. There were always people searching for somebody to put the
                        blame on, but both of them were used to that by now. </p>
                    <p>The public was expecting some progress out of these talks. He was hopeful
                        that progress would be achieved. He wanted to assure the President that his
                        Government would stay on course and would continue the very close
                        cooperation with his American friends. These close and friendly ties were a
                        stabilizing factor all around the world. </p>
                    <p>There were some trends in Germany to lean closer to France. He was convinced
                        that Franco-German reconciliation was important for Europe as otherwise
                        there could be no progress on the road to economic and political unity of
                        Europe. </p>
                    <p>Those that wanted to lean more towards France and away from the United States
                        were in the minority but they made a lot of noise and the number of them
                        were to be found right in the Parliament. He did not believe in a bilateral
                        arrangement with France but all the free European countries should get
                        together as one unit. </p>
                    <p>There were two big issues the two should talk about which could not be
                        exhausted in this initial conversation. </p>
                    <p>First, there was the offset problem with a deadline coming up on the 30th of
                        June. A new formula would have to be found in a follow-up agreement at that
                        time. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, there was the question of the US troops stationed in Germany. Their
                        presence was the best protection and guarantee for German security. </p>
                    <p>On both these points he felt sure solutions could be found that would be
                        useful to the United States and practicable for the Germans. Such solutions
                        would have to be connected with the general aspect of the strategy of
                        defense for Europe. Technical changes had taken place and also changes in
                        philosophy. These had injected an element of uncertainty and insecurity.
                        There was no lack of trust in the United States but the German people wanted
                        to know where exactly they stand at this point in terms of security, how
                        they would be protected in the event of the conclusion of a
                        non-proliferation treaty. They would have to know which voice they would
                        have in nuclear strategy. Nobody was expecting a “hardware solution” any
                        longer. What was needed and desired was a common solution under NATO. As
                        affirmed in the Peace Note, Germany had renounced the right to produce
                            <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons nor did they want national
                        control of such weapons. However, there was an arsenal of <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s in Eastern Europe as well as mobile
                        launch facilities threatening Western Europe. The question was where the
                        Germans' voice would come in on the spectrum that might range anywhere from
                        0.1 to 100. And the point to be chosen would have to be believable to the
                        public. </p>
                    <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0503"/>
                    <p>He believed both questions (offset, troops) were soluble. He was under great
                        pressure because of the reports circulated by the press and the public
                        opinion generated by it. He knew the President had similar problems. It
                        would be advisable, therefore, for them to put things into a clear language. </p>
                    <p>He had had a two-hour discussion in depth on the previous day with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> where a lot of ground had already been

                    <p>The President said no, he had not been informed yet. He had only come back to
                        Washington late yesterday. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated that he had expressed his willingness to engage in
                        tripartite talks if they should be necessary, but he thought the bilateral
                        talks should first continue. </p>
                    <p>The President could be assured of the continuing loyalty to the Alliance and
                        deepest friendship of the German people. </p>
                    <p>The President replied he respected greatly the leadership of the Chancellor
                        and he had a great personal affection for him. He generally agreed with all
                        the Chancellor had just said. This was a critical time in the world and both
                        countries were in a serious situation. He was anxious to help the Chancellor
                        wherever he could. He was sure constructive solutions could be found. He was
                        anxious to hear and interested in any ideas the Chancellor might want to
                        expound. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that not only he himself but all the Germans knew how
                        much they owed to the United States. They were deeply appreciative of the
                        American sacrifices for freedom in Viet-Nam. The German Government wanted to
                        again review how much more they could do to support the US in Viet-Nam. If
                        it was not for the firm stand of the US there, the insecurity, for instance
                        in Berlin, would be much greater. The loyalty of the US to its commitment as
                        demonstrated in Viet-Nam was a beacon of hope to the Germans and deeply
                        appreciated by them. </p>
                    <p>He hoped the President would not misunderstand him but he wanted to say that
                        a different German Government that might succeed his Government may not show
                        the same loyalty and determination to cultivate close ties with the United
                        States. Though such a Government would not turn its back on the NATO, it
                        might, however, contribute to at least a moral loosening of the NATO ties. </p>
                    <p>He hoped the President would not misinterpret this remark. He was not
                        concerned about himself but was only thinking of the common good for the two
                        countries. </p>
                    <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>
                    <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">offset</hi> problem, which he knew had
                        played a big role in the US balance of payments situation, he wanted the
                        President to understand that the Government found itself in a very difficult
                        situation. The steep economic growth curve of the past had flattened out.
                        Germany had made financial commitments in the past counting on the
                        continuation of such growth. They had now been forced to make serious
                        reductions in their forthcoming budget. The situation was so bad that about
                        thirty existing laws calling for certain expenditures would have to be
                        changed, though they had already been passed and approved. One could imagine
                        what the reaction would be in Parliament and in public opinion. </p>
                    <p>The Government had been forced to propose a stabilization act which was just
                        taking effect. There were some hopeful signs for the future. Prices showed a
                        trend of stabilizing in the recent past and the exhausted capital market
                        showed some signs of recovery. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">However, out of the current budget it would not be
                            possible to fulfill all financial obligations under the current offset
                            agreement to the full amount</hi>. This did not mean that Germany would
                        not stand by its promise. The whole amount would definitely be honored in
                        full. What was needed was just some easement for the current time. </p>
                    <p>The Central Bank was contemplating certain possibilities, as far as feasible
                        under the limitations of the Central Bank Act. Under the current two year
                        agreement $450 million in treasury bills would have to be purchased still
                        this year. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could pay $250 million of
                        this amount still in 1966. This would leave $650 million still to be paid by
                        June 30, 1967. </p>
                    <p>This problem might be tackled in a business-like way. A businessman finding
                        himself in unexpected cash difficulties may sometimes ask to pay with a
                        note. This would not necessarily make him any less trustworthy. He wanted
                        the President to understand that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        would of course pay as much as at all possible by July 1, 1967 out of their
                        budget as well as other available sources. Any remainder would have to be
                        carried into next year's follow-up agreement. The military budget would be
                        raised proportionately next year.. </p>
                    <p>The attitude of the FRG towards the American dollar had shown their goodwill.
                        The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had bought $750 million worth of
                        Roosa Bonds, had raised the swap-line from $250 million to $400 million, had
                        not sold any dollars or bought any gold since 1962. The trade balance, apart
                        from the offset payments, was showing a favorable balance in the amount of
                        $800 to $900 million a year for the United States. Private US investment in
                        Germany had risen from $50 million to $250 million over the last six years
                        and no change in the generous German attitude in this field was anticipated. </p>
                    <p>He was just mentioning these data to illustrate the basic goodwill and
                        sympathetic attitude of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The
                        President might recall that the <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0505"/>German Government paid some war debts off ahead of time to help the
                        American position. </p>
                    <p>As far as the amounts in question here were concerned it should be easy to
                        find an agreeable solution acceptable to both sides. A new agreement on July
                        1 could settle any remaining questions. </p>
                    <p>The President asked the Chancellor to tell him something about the nature of
                        the new Stabilization Act. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor explained the reasons for the necessity of this Act and its
                        basic provisions to the President and volunteered to send him a copy of the
                        Act if he should be interested. </p>
                    <p>The President said yes, he would appreciate getting a copy of the law. </p>
                    <p>He said he agreed with the Chancellor that the two points he had singled out
                        (offset, troops) represented the critical area in the current relations
                        between the two countries. If anything, his problems were even more severe
                        than those of the Chancellor. It was not quite clear to him what the essence
                        of the Chancellor's remarks was. In the past he had always taken the German
                        word for granted. The US situation in this respect was serious enough even
                        if the Germans would keep their commitments. Maybe some of them could be
                        covered by non-military purchases. If the Germans could not keep their
                        commitments it would put them in a very serious and disconcerting position.
                        He would have to look at this very carefully then. This would just nullify
                        the existing agreement. The Chancellor was aware of his problem here with
                        regard to the troop situation. This was very disheartening to him. However,
                        he would try to be as flexible as possible. Did the Chancellor mean to say
                        he could not fulfill his obligations through military purchases alone or did
                        he imply other things were to be included like buying bonds? Or not at all?
                        How could he (the President) defend himself if the Chancellor was not
                        meeting his commitments? </p>
                    <p>On troops, it might be easier to find a solution. Certain reductions could be
                        made, if the Chancellor was willing to take the lead. He asked the
                        Chancellor to specify exactly what he could not do this year. Could he not
                        do anything in space cooperation and bonds either? </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor pointed out that in the overall foreign exchange position the
                        US showed a favorable balance of about $510 million a year, despite the
                        support of troops on German soil. To the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        this was not so much a balance of payments problem as a serious budgetary
                        problem. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was determined to fulfill
                        the offset agreement to the last dollar. All that was asked, and he hoped
                        the President would understand this, was a prolongation for a certain amount
                        at the current time. A new agreement could specify how the rollover would
                        exactly be paid and it would be paid just like that. He would check and see
                        if more could be paid by <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0506"/>July 1
                        through inclusion of purchases of computers, space equipment and items of a
                        similar nature. </p>
                    <p>He regretted it very much if the impression arose on the outside that
                        maintenance of US troops in Germany was directly connected to the German
                        financial payments. In the past this matter never presented any problem. The
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had to build an army from scratch.
                        But now the process was completed, the defense needs are lower, and the two
                        ends did no longer fit. </p>
                    <p>Another possibility might be to free through the Central Bank, if this turned
                        out to be feasible, $220 million in postwar aid, bearing an interest rate of
                        2.1 percent, and falling due only in 1989. This might be paid this year and,
                        of course, would not be deducted from the total offset obligation. This,
                        together with the $250 million previously mentioned, would allow the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to buy $470 million worth of bonds. </p>
                    <p>The President reiterated his disappointment about a German commitment not
                        being truly honored. He said he had been able to always completely count on
                        the German word in the past. This was now putting him in deep trouble. He
                        did not want to be arbitrary with the Chancellor, but if he could not keep
                        his word it would seriously aggravate his own position, financially and
                        otherwise. He suggested both sides refer this to their experts (Bank,
                        Defense, Treasury) to see what proposals they could come up with. He
                        understood the Chancellor's problems. He wanted to be a true friend to him.
                        However, he did not want to see a situation created that might have
                        regrettable results for both of them.</p>
                    <p>He did not want to be too inflexible. Otherwise he might win the argument but
                        lose the sale. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied it was bitter for him to hear the President say he
                        could not trust the German word. The President had no reason to doubt the
                        German sincerity and loyalty. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was
                        not unilaterally saying it would not pay or would not stand by its promise.
                        The agreement would be honored to the last penny. Only some easement in time
                        was asked. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would make every effort
                        to pay as much as at all possible by July 1. He would never break a promise.
                        The President had no reason to doubt the German sincerity. The past had
                        shown their ties of friendship to be very close and these two items should
                        and would not interfere with this. </p>
                    <p>The President suggested they join the other members of the delegation in the
                        Cabinet Room and take the matter up with them. </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor agreed to this and added, as long as they were still alone
                        together, he would like to pronounce another very special request. </p>
                    <p>He would like to very warmly invite the President to come for a visit to
                        Germany at a time that would be suitable to him. Next spring might be a good
                        time. The President could not at all imagine how much this would mean to
                        Germany. It would disperse a lot of doubts. He was certain he <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0507"/>would get a tremendous spontaneous
                        reception. Such a visit should be extremely valuable to both countries. By
                        modern standards it had been a long time since an American President had
                        visited Germany. Such a visit would make some problems in Germany a lot
                        easier to solve and would make the German people more willing to make
                        sacrifices for the common cause. It would be a great thing for both
                        countries. </p>
                    <p>The President thanked the Chancellor for the invitation. He said he would
                        think about it and suggested they now join the rest of the party in the
                        Cabinet Room.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">A 2-page memorandum of

                    <p>I had a strenuous but useful meeting with the Chancellor. As you know, he has
                        now agreed to join with you and ourselves in a tripartite review—to begin
                        promptly—of the entire range of relevant questions: the nature of the
                        threat; strategy, force levels and deployments; burden-sharing; and foreign
                        exchange neutralization. I have in mind asking <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> to represent me in these talks. I would very
                        much hope that you could name some public figure of comparable stature and
                        objectivity. </p>
                    <p>In connection with the points you made to me in your note of August 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">
                            <ref target="#d198fn3">See footnote 3, Document 198</ref>.</note> let me
                        say that I can certainly understand why it may be necessary for you to
                        announce in mid-October your determination to reduce by some 33 million
                        pounds the foreign exchange drain associated with the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>. However, I am sure you will understand
                        why I must emphasize again the importance of avoiding public commitment to
                        troop cuts and drawdown of stocks until we have completed our tripartite
                        talks. Otherwise, these talks will lose credibility and political usefulness
                        in all three countries and throughout the Alliance. (None of this, of
                        course, arises in connection with the 8 million pounds of the 33 million
                        pounds which would not involve reductions in either troops or stocks.) </p>
                    <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0508"/>
                    <p>In your shoes, I would certainly not back away from the savings target. The
                        question is only whether it would be possible for you to say that the steps
                        by which <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> will realize these savings
                        cannot be decided until the completion of the tripartite discussions. I
                        myself have every intention of insisting that we complete these discussions
                        by mid-January. This should give you time to make whatever moves will be
                        necessary to achieve your savings target in your fiscal year beginning April
                        1, 1967. </p>
                    <p>You will not be surprised, incidentally, that the newspaper reports on what
                        was agreed between myself and Erhard are, as usual, thoroughly mixed up.
                        Specifically, we in no sense agreed, either explicitly or tacitly, to the
                        German proposition that there would have to be some fixed upper limit to the
                        amount to foreign exchange neutralization after June 30, 1967. Our position
                        was—and is—that the question of future offset will have to be thrashed out
                        thoroughly in the tripartite discussions. (Your people will of course have
                        made available to you the communique.) </p>
                    <p>If we make the tripartite procedure work, it can help us hold off the
                        pressures on each of us, including <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, to do things which would badly damage NATO and the
                        Western position in Europe. Indeed, it can give us a start in
                        reconsolidating the Alliance for the longer pull—and on a more sustainable
                        basis—until the day when the French will be ready to rejoin the fold. And,
                        if we fail to make it work, I am afraid we are in for serious trouble. </p>

                        Secretary's post-luncheon conversation with French Foreign Minister on
                        October 3 regarding NATO matters were as follows: </p>
                    <p>1. Secretary said he had impression French did not wish have any arrangements
                        which would prejudge in advance position they might take in event of war and
                        it is therefore hard to see how <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> could
                        count on functioning effectively in Paris in wartime. He asked how French
                        could guarantee this. Couve, in response, wondered why same question did not
                        apply to location in some other country. Secretary replied that other
                        members have not brought into question their readiness to take common
                        action, and that rest of us have made arrangements on basis of contingency
                        that we will act together. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said
                        French are prepared make arrangements in event we go to war together and
                        could not understand how this differed from previous situation. </p>
                    <p>2. Foreign Minister said he did not dispute right of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to move to Brussels if they wished do so. Secretary said
                        that if in wartime NAC is cut off from communications with military
                        commands, its position would be difficult. He said we operate on assumption
                        Belgium and Netherlands will join together in common action in event of war.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said this was
                        “psychological analysis” and if this is case then <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should go to Brussels and France would make no objection.
                        Secretary thought question of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> relocation
                        would be settled during next thirty days. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> repeated that problem did not lie with France
                        regarding <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> relocation.</p>
                    <p>3. Foreign Minister felt current discussions academic since there would be no
                        war in Europe. Secretary differed in recalling that we had very close call
                        only four years ago over Berlin crisis and wondered if four years is long
                        enough to be sure about Soviet intentions. He said that if NATO breaks up
                        this might stimulate USSR to draw wrong conclusions and to provoke another
                        crisis. Couve said NATO must readjust to meet changed conditions and
                        Secretary asked whether there have been real changes or illusions of change.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> thought stabilizing element
                        of nuclear standoff between US and USSR became apparent during Cuban crisis
                        and that this is basis for equilibrium in Europe rather than existence of
                        NATO.</p>
                    <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0510"/>
                    <p>4. Foreign Minister said question of arrangements to be made in event of war
                        is in French view not urgent and does not have to be settled now. He said we
                        can wait to see how things develop in NATO particularly from psychological
                        standpoint. He said same would hold true concerning French military presence
                        in Germany. </p>
                    <p>5. Secretary recalled Couve had said in Brussels that French air defense
                        units must be withdrawn from Germany since they could lead to automatic
                        French involvement in war. Foreign Minister had said this did not apply to
                        ground forces and French were indifferent whether latter forces remained in
                        Germany or returned to France. Secretary noted situation with our troops is
                        quite different. Couve acknowledged this true but said this was statement of
                        fact, not of legal situation. </p>
                    <p>6. On US facilities in France, Secretary said he wished make clear we never
                        accepted April 1, 1967 date as compelling with regard to our withdrawals.
                        While we will get out of France as soon as possible there will be some
                        material not removed until after April 1. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said this has been clear all along. Secretary also
                        said we make complete reservation regarding financial aspects of relocation
                        in addition to those provided for in US bilateral agreements with France.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he noted US position,
                        although this position of course did not commit France. </p>
                    <p>7. Foreign Minister recalled his discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">The discussion under reference here has not
                            been further identified. </note> about civilian control of US pipeline
                        in France in peacetime and said arrangements for wartime use could only be
                        made when time comes. Secretary said that arrangements to use facilities in
                        France if made only when war comes would be too late, and that arrangements
                        must be made in advance if they are to be effective. Couve reiterated
                        unwillingness of France to make wartime arrangements in advance and said if
                        France decides to go to war all this can be arranged. Secretary postulated
                        that it may be easier for US forces to secure oil through neutral countries
                        in wartime than through France. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                        doubted it would be any easier in wartime to secure oil through Sweden or
                        Switzerland than France. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                        thought pipeline question could be left open regarding possible wartime use
                        and only present question is therefore that of periodic US inspections of
                        French management. </p>
                    <p>8. While peacetime use of pipeline and telecommunications would continue into
                        wartime unless operation stopped by French, <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> pointed out this not case with other facilities which
                        would have to be prepared in advance to be useful. Foreign Minister wondered
                        how any country could agree to our use of facilities without that country
                        having declared war. Secretary said we operate on basis of common assumption
                        with other countries as indicated in point 1 above. </p>

                        discussion of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> relocation. Full report

                        </note> Highlights in this cable.</p>
                    <p>2. Meeting provided snapshot of present state of thinking of every member of
                        Fourteen. </p>
                    <p>A. US, Netherlands, UK, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Luxembourg and
                        Iceland clearly favor a decision to move, and would be willing to have
                        decision made at PermRep level. </p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, Norway and Portugal are ready to go
                        along with majority; Norway is relaxed upon how decision is taken, Portugal
                        leans toward and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> favors a formal
                        confirmation at Ministerial level in December. </p>
                    <p>C. Canada and Denmark are not yet ready to make the substantive decision, and
                        strongly favor decision taken at Ministerial level in December. </p>
                    <p>3. Arguments used by those who want to act soon were mostly familiar: need
                        for propinquity to SHAPE and collocation with Military Committee; need for
                        assured communication; need for decision before December to avoid undue
                        political significance of having December meeting in Paris; need for NATO
                        headquarters to flourish in simpatico atmosphere; need to maintain
                        credibility NATO deterrent and determination vis-a-vis the Soviets. </p>
                    <p>4. One argument not previously stressed was high economic cost of further
                        delay in deciding to move. Point (stressed by Netherlands, Norway and UK)
                        was that if we stay in Paris after SHAPE, <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss>, and other agencies move out, we will have to set up new
                        communication channels which will then have to be duplicated by later move
                        to Brussels. An early decision to move might obviate some of the duplicate
                        expenses. </p>
                    <p>5. Next session on this subject will be Thursday Oct 20. Hope of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and most PermReps is that
                        today's demonstration of overwhelming majority sentiment for relocating
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will soften position of Canada and
                        Denmark, whose representatives here do not yet even have authority to
                        discuss the substance of the question. </p>
                    <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0512"/>
                    <p>6. We will continue to press for early decision to leave Paris and move to
                        Brussels. (There is no objection to Brussels as new site, once decision to
                        move is agreed.) We can then afford to demonstrate some flexibility in
                        procedure whereby decision is somehow formally taken at Ministerial level.
                        But meanwhile our interest lies in driving toward a consensus on the
                        substance, reserving procedural flexibility for the moment when it is needed
                        to bring the Danes and Canadians aboard. </p>
                    <p>7. My guess is Danes will be more impressed with the near consensus already
                        reached to move than the Canadian Foreign Minister will be. If Chalfont
                        heard Danish Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName>
                        correctly, there may already be the basis for softening the line in
                        Copenhagen. In any case, it is now clear that Danes and Canadians are only
                        real holdouts.<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">By October 19, the countries in
                            doubt had lifted their reservations of moving the North Atlantic

                        that the United States and its European allies must move ahead on three
                        fronts: “First, to modernize NATO and strengthen other Atlantic alliances.
                        Second, to further the integration of the Western European community. Third,
                        to quicken progress in East-West relations.”</p>
                    <p>The President then outlined what steps needed to be taken on each of these
                        fronts. For text of his remarks on this occasion, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, pages

                    <p>6007. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subject: French forces in
                        Germany. </p>
                    <p>1. Position on French forces in Germany is briefly this: </p>
                    <p>A. French have clearly run out on the arrangement worked out between the
                        Secretary and Couve de Murville, and confirmed by all fifteen Ministers, at
                        Brussels in June. French now insist that talks on French forces in Germany
                        be conducted only by military commanders; there is no indication they would
                        ever (even after report from the commanders) be willing to negotiate in the
                        Council the “mission” of those forces, which they regard as solely a
                        decision for French Government to make. </p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has abandoned (without due notice to
                        us, by the way) the joint strategy we worked out with them for a preliminary
                        agreement with French in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Germans are
                        quite prepared for talks between <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>
                        and General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName>, without any
                        political preliminaries at all. </p>
                    <p>C. The only conceivable way to budge French from their position would be for
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to be clearly willing to invite
                        French troops to leave Germany unless they are satisfactorily related to
                        NATO. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is clearly in no position
                        to do any such thing, and said as much to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> at their last meeting—or so the French believe. </p>
                    <p>D. There is no prospect that <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> can
                        settle this matter with the French unless the Fourteen instruct General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> to accept whatever
                        General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName> has been authorized
                        to offer, and that is not a position in which the Alliance should place its
                        Supreme Commander.</p>
                    <p>E. In these circumstances an agreement with France that gives these forces a
                        NATO character, even tentatively and tenuously, is not achievable. </p>
                    <p>2. Our options are therefore in a very narrow range indeed. We can either </p>
                    <p>a. Pretend that these troops might somehow be related to NATO even though the
                        French won't say just how, in order to help the Germans pretend that they
                        are not there as purely French national troops under French national
                        control; or </p>
                    <p>b. Do nothing in NATO, and thus invite a bilateral side agreement between FRG
                        and France to keep the French troops in Germany anyway. </p>
                    <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0514"/>
                    <p>3. A bilateral agreement outside of NATO is so damaging to so many of our
                        objectives in Europe, and regarded as so dangerous by all our allies, that
                        let's pretend alternative a is the least worse. </p>
                    <p>4. I see no use at all in prolonging the agony at the political level. If we
                        delegate the problem to the military commanders with instructions to report
                        back to the Council, we will just have to recognize in a month or so (or
                        perhaps at the December Ministerial Meeting) the facts of life as set forth
                        above. Therefore, let's end these “negotiations” now. </p>
                    <p>5. There is a simple and effective way to do this. The Fourteen can draft a
                        short instruction to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, saying in
                        effect: </p>
                    <p>a. We have listened carefully to what French representatives have told us, on
                        several occasions, in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>b. We derive from these French statements the conclusion that the French
                        troops in Germany might in some future circumstances be associated with NATO
                        in the defense of Western Europe. </p>
                    <p>c. In view of this possibility, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>
                        should maintain continuous liaison with the French military authorities for
                        discussion of any plans and preparations which may be appropriate to the
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>6. This would not require <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> to try to
                        reach agreement with General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName> on any particular subject at any particular time.
                        They would not be required to make joint recommendations to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. If General Lemnitzer felt the need for
                        further political guidance on particular problems that might arise in his
                        liaison relationship with the French Chief of Staff, he would repair to the
                        Fourteen for such guidance. </p>
                    <p>7. The desire to get rid of the problem for this month, even if it has to
                        come up again later, is now so great among the Fourteen that the procedure
                        in paragraphs 5 and 6 may not be saleable at this stage. (It could also be
                        used later on, if the military commanders first try and fail to arrive at an
                        “agreement”.) But in my judgment it is so much better than dragging on
                        through a predictably humiliating non-negotiation, that I recommend I be
                        authorized to try it on for size the next time the Fourteen take up French
                        forces in Germany. If it cannot be sold at this stage, then there is no
                        alternative to going ahead with <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>-<persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName> talks
                        ad referendum to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, and I should be in a
                        position as fallback to go along with the majority that already wants to
                        take that next step. </p>
                    <p>8. Since Secretary was personally involved in the Brussels arrangement from
                        which his French colleague has now “withdrawn”, I am repeating this message
                        to Manila for his attention.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">On October 25, in a

                    <p>1. In informal atmosphere at <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>
                        residence, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> gave candid
                        informal account of his mission he has been given by President and of
                        just-concluded two days of trilateral talks in Bonn. Present were Deputy SYG
                        Roberts of Fourteen, and PermReps except Portugal and Turkey represented by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Charles</persName>, as well as State
                        Department Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>. French
                        PermRep was not invited. </p>
                    <p>2. Half hour of lively interchange that followed was carried by <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> (Belgium), Alessandrini
                        (Italy), and Boon (Netherlands) by now, ghost of tripartite directorate has
                        been exorcised, but exclusion from even ad hoc temporary tripartite group is
                        clearly underlying cause of Italian pique. Main burden of complaint was that
                        three, however worthy their motives—and candid persuasive <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> presentation left no room for
                        innuendos on this score—had constituted themselves a “self-appointed group”
                            (<persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName>'s phrase), without
                        prior consultation, to do what all members of NATO had an interest in, and
                        what NATO was created to do and was actively undertaking in current force
                        planning exercise. Thus, action of three implied lack of confidence in NATO
                        and their partners, condemned NATO force planning exercise to ineffectuality
                        until results of trilateral talks were in hand, and all this quite
                        unnecessarily since NATO if only it had been asked could either have done
                        itself the job that the trilateral talks were seeking to do on an urgent
                        basis, or could have established the group of three with a formal NATO
                        blessing.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> was most helpful in
                        emphasizing that Germans could not have accepted decisive talks with US and
                        UK on offset problems without also embracing broader issues of strategy and
                        force levels. He challenged <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0516"/>his
                        colleagues to show what real alternative procedure there was to that chosen
                        by three. <persName corresp="#p_SSCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> was more
                        cautious, reiterating familiar UK points about need for quick conclusion of
                        trilateral talks and for close ties between these talks and NATO work. He
                        did, however, quietly counter Dutch argument that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> could have done what trilateral talks are designed to do,
                        by pointing out that UK this year has twice brought its financial and
                        budgetary problems of troop maintenance into <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> without noticeable results either from “Callaghan study” or
                        recent Annual Review committee study. </p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> with help from Bowie good
                        humoredly but firmly reiterated that US had launched trilateral talks to
                        meet what it continued to feel was clear and pressing financial problem in
                        US and UK with political overtones which ran real risk of producing
                        extremely dangerous attrition of NATO defense posture and required
                        extraordinary and rapid action to cope with it. They insisted that US and
                        its partners in trilateral talks had need to clear their minds jointly and
                        stave off possible unilateral or bilateral actions that would indeed present
                        Alliance with fait accompli. Trilateral talks would be conducted with full
                        opportunity for <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to participate and
                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> to make his voice heard, and
                        results would be put to NATO as whole, beginning with report at December

                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said he thought the
                        comments by his colleagues on trilateral procedures (in meetings of Fourteen
                        and at this informal session) had been clear and forceful, and had
                        adequately registered the reaction of some of our allies, for future
                        reference. But problem now was to get on with deciding just how work in NATO
                        between now and December would be meshed with trilateral talks, and how
                        results of trilateral talks would be fed into preparations for NATO's
                        December Ministerial Meeting. He hoped that at meeting of Fourteen on Monday
                        and thereafter further postmortems on procedures already adopted could be
                        held to a minimum, in favor of practical discussion of what NATO is going to
                        do about undeniably important and urgent matters of substance.</p>
                    <p>6. Most PermReps remained silent, letting Belgian, Dutch and Italian carry
                        dialogue. (Canadian PermRep Ritchie made one brief remark along the same
                        line.) But after meeting Kristianson (Norway), Palamas (Greece) and Reuter
                        (Luxembourg) indicated separately that they thoroughly agreed we have had
                        enough catharsis, and time for some accelerated force planning was already
                        overdue. There were many expressions of great appreciation for <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s willingness to stop by Paris to
                        conduct this briefing. </p>

                        trilateral talks will try to accomplish will be a reference point in future
                        NATO discussions. He made it transparently clear that neither he <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0517"/>nor US has any purpose other than to
                        strengthen Alliance on basis of realistic assessment of current

                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Now that we have been working out new relationship between NATO and France
                        for the past eight months, I think it would be helpful to have agreed
                        picture of situation. I would appreciate your comments on scene as we see
                        it: </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"> NATO </p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has given clear
                        instruction that France is to disengage from all NATO military activities
                        with few exceptions such as early <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0518"/>warning activities which he is willing to tolerate as sop to French
                        military. He is willing to have General Staff talks between France and NATO
                        military authorities as well as permanent French military liaison missions
                        to NATO military components, which will be empowered to exchange information
                        and arrange for communications but will not be empowered to enter into
                        arrangements or undertake engagements which might compromise French ability
                        to remain neutral if it so chooses in event of war. On political level
                        France remains a party to the Treaty and member of Alliance represented on
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and other non-military activities.
                        For public consumption, it is “an ally of its allies,” even though it has
                        undermined the confidence of both its NATO and <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> allies in sincerity of its undertakings. This posture
                        should be adequate to get French Government through next parliamentary
                        elections without any serious domestic questions being raised on French
                        relations with NATO.</p>
                    <p>3. Rigid French position has finally brought back to reality those Allies who
                        put primary value on maintaining French association at whatever cost to
                        Alliance. Thus pace of decisions has increased. Major steps taken or
                        underway to date are: </p>
                    <p>a) <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will move to Brussels, SHAPE to
                        Casteau in Belgium, <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> to Maastricht
                        area in Netherlands. The Military Committee is expected to follow <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to Brussels. </p>
                    <p>b) French forces will remain in Germany. Germans clearly want them to remain
                        and need multilateral cover for Franco-German bilateral on facilities.
                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> and General <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName> will discuss technical
                        arrangements to relate French and NATO military activities and report to
                        their Principals. France proved unwilling to implement pertinent portion of
                        Brussels Ministerial communique of last June and was unwilling even to agree
                        that, once it had declared war under Article 5 of the Treaty, French forces
                        would serve in the NATO military framework. </p>
                    <p>c) <gloss target="#t_NADGE1">NADGE</gloss> is major exceptional activity
                        which Fourteen and France have preliminarily agreed to carry through.
                        Fourteen want France's financial contribution. France wants early warning
                        intelligence. Project would be operable without French stations. </p>
                    <p>4. There remain a number of areas to be clarified, negotiated or decided: </p>
                    <p>a) The “constitutional question” of continuing French role in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and its subsidiary bodies, and how we deal
                        with this at the short and medium term. Our general position has been to let
                        French initiate own withdrawals (which being rapidly done) and, where they
                        remain, to assert principle that France is not permitted to negate or stop
                        work from which it has withdrawn. The Fourteen is now considering a proposal
                        by which the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>, without France, would have
                        broad responsibilities as Board of Directors for NATO defense activities. </p>
                    <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>b) Terms of French participation in certain NATO military support agencies
                        such as NATO Supply Center, SHAPE Technical Center and <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> Research Center. </p>
                    <p>c) Possible relocation of those military support agencies now located in
                        France such as Hawk NPLO, NATO Maintenance and Supply Organization, and
                        AGARD.</p>
                    <p>d) French financial participation in selected activities which fall under the
                        military budget and future infrastructure projects. While France is
                        withdrawing from such activities and projects, it has indicated interest in
                        participating selectively. We have under consideration proposal to increase
                        percentage price to French since they would be choosing only nationally
                        useful programs. </p>
                    <p>e) French financial liability arising from French unilateral abrogation of
                        agreements, which forced US and NATO withdrawal from France. </p>
                    <p>f) Overflights of French territory. France continues to permit these on
                        monthly basis, but will give no firm assurance about policy in time of
                        crisis. Fourteen agree it is better to proceed on this basis than to
                        precipitate issue which might lead French to reduce degree of cooperation. </p>
                    <p>5. In sum, major relocations and decisions of principle have now largely been
                        taken; there remain number of lesser points to be worked out, chiefly in
                        liaison and financial areas. There will be no definitive overall France-NATO
                        arrangement, but series of agreements and understandings is emerging which
                        cumulatively and pragmatically have already clearly defined France's
                        relationship to Fourteen as “neutral” nation which will not accept
                        commitments of any nature which hamper its freedom of decision. </p>
                    <p>6. We expect that it will take good part of next year to wrap up loose ends.
                        French actions since de Gaulle announced public withdrawals last spring have
                        already resulted in more extensive withdrawals than originally anticipated
                        by many Allies. This is particularly evident in such areas as French
                        abstention from the Military Committee and French treatment of the problem
                        of mission of French troops in Germany. We would expect in general that
                        future actions by both France and the Fourteen will result in even more
                        complete French divorce from the military side of the Alliance. Unknown, at
                        this point, is degree to which France may restrict its own participation in
                        non-military, and especially political, activities of the Alliance. French
                        abstention from <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> report on East-West
                        relations may be straw in the wind. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">France-US </p>
                    <p>7. Bilateral discussions have been held with French regarding withdrawal from
                        facilities in France during which (a) we have reaffirmed we do not accept
                        April 1, 1967 deadline for withdrawals, (b) <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0520"/>French have reiterated they are prepared recognize problems
                        we have that will stretch out our withdrawals but ask that we inform them
                        fully regarding our plans, (c) French have cooperated in enabling special
                        measures and workers to be introduced to move stocks, and in allowing
                        schools to complete this academic year with continuation of appropriate
                        support facilities. </p>
                    <p>8. Separate bilateral discussions have been held between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> and French Foreign Minister in which
                        French have made clear that: </p>
                    <p>a) They are unwilling for any US equipment or military personnel to remain in
                        France even under French control.</p>
                    <p>b) They are willing to permit continued US use in peacetime including time of
                        crisis of petroleum pipeline and telecommunications facilities under French
                        management, and are awaiting our response to this offer. </p>
                    <p>c) They can give no assurance regarding continued use of pipeline and
                        telecommunications facilities, or re-entry into any other facilities in
                        event of war. </p>
                    <p>d) They willing to consult regarding possible re-entry into other facilities
                        should new crisis arise. </p>
                    <p>e) Any re-entry into facilities will depend upon French national decision at
                        time of crisis or in event of war, and no assurance can be given regarding
                        French position in advance. It is apparent French wish to be in position to
                        exercise option of avoiding any involvement. </p>
                    <p>9. Although <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is not likely to
                        revive notion of withdrawing from North Atlantic Treaty prior to March 1967
                        elections, he will continue to disentangle France from any bilateral or
                        multilateral military relationship with US in order to retain maximum
                        flexibility in exploiting Viet Nam situation, enhance French role in Europe
                        at expense of US, and ensure full French freedom of action in event Viet Nam
                        conflict develops into general war. French relations with US in private
                        sector will continue on normal basis with constantly expanding trade, travel
                        and other relations. French will seek correct and friendly government
                        relations on all strictly bilateral questions. In military field, US expects
                        to complete its bilateral reentry discussions with French and submit report
                        to Fourteen during next month. </p>

                    <p>I am immensely heartened by your courageous announcement about joining the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Your entry would certainly help to
                        strengthen and unify the West. If you find on the way that there is anything
                        we might do to smooth the path, I hope you will let me know. </p>
                    <p>The report from <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> on the
                        Trilateral talks is encouraging, despite the real difficulties we still
                        face. <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> made an excellent
                            contribution.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">The second round of trilateral
                            talks took place at the Department of State November 9–10, with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> again representing their countries. In this
                            round they discussed questions of military capabilities, the defense
                            burden, and the foreign exchange problems resulting from the stationing
                            of troops in Germany. Summaries of the meetings were transmitted to
                            Paris in telegrams 82537, 83122, and 83129, November 10. (Ibid., Central
                            Files, DEF 1 <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> W) The text of an
                            agreed tripartite minute, which outlined the steps necessary to deter
                            aggression, was transmitted to Paris in telegram 83128, November 10.
                            (Ibid., DEF 6 NATO) For text of the communique issued at the conclusion
                            of the second round, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 6, 1966, p. 867. </note> I am hopeful that
                        we can get a genuine return from this exercise—militarily, politically and
                        financially. </p>
                    <p>The immediate snag, which <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>
                        confirmed, is the inevitability of delay on the German side. While they can
                        fruitfully continue to work with us in the Trilateral Group, it would be
                        impossible for them to reach a responsible government position on these
                        matters in time to keep the present schedule. We should surely give the
                        Germans a chance to get themselves a government. </p>
                    <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0522"/>
                    <p>I know we agree that we must move together in order to maintain NATO as a
                        credible deterrent and as a stabilizing influence, especially in Germany.
                        Your presence in Germany is as important to us as your presence in the East,
                        which I assume remains as we last discussed it. </p>
                    <p>I understand, as you know, the importance to you of being able to justify a
                        change in your announced program, in view of the pressures inherent in your
                        difficult but promising policies of economic adjustment. Would it help if I
                        placed in the United Kingdom in the near future $35 million in orders beyond
                        those already agreed to? I think I could do so on assurance from you that
                        you will stay with us and the Germans in completing this fundamental review
                        of the military, political and financial basis for the US–UK presence in
                        Germany, making no change in your troop and supply dispositions there until
                        after the completion of the review, and then that you will concert with us
                        on any such changes in the light of that review. This procurement would
                        supplement the accruals of dollars to you associated with the recent shift
                        of our forces and installations to Britain from the Continent. </p>
                    <p>I may get some heat from Congress on this, and cannot move definitively until
                        I have talked it over with some of my people on the Hill. I think I can
                        persuade them to go along on the basis outlined here. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and our government officials
                        are working on plans to handle deficits that result from the presence of our
                        troops abroad through a multilateral clearing arrangement that should help
                        neutralize balances, and contribute to an ultimate resolution of the
                        monetary problem. That may take some time to negotiate. If successful, such
                        an arrangement should help to satisfy some of our critics in Congress, and
                        move the Germans to accept their own proper responsibilities. </p>
                    <p>I cannot stress too strongly the need for progress towards more equitable
                        patterns for dealing with the various responsibilities we all bear
                        throughout the world. As we both know, some of the criticism I get here on
                        the subject is justified. And, as you can imagine, the new Congress will not
                        be easier to persuade than its predecessor. </p>
                    <p>I very much hope that the arrangements proposed here will help you to join us
                        in keeping this exercise on the tracks. Let us keep in close touch on
                            this.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Printed from an unsigned copy. </note>

                    <p>1. NATO Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        visited Washington Nov 16–18 for informal discussions. He met with
                        Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Under Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> and Rostow, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>, among others.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">Memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s conversations with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>,

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Following are highlights of discussions in Department based on uncleared
                        memoranda of conversation, <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_Noforn1">Noforn</gloss>, and subject to revision on review. </p>
                    <p>3. Organization of December Ministerial Meeting. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and US participants agreed appropriate arrangement of
                        agenda items would be necessary so as to clearly delineate business to be
                        considered by the Fourteen Ministers (meeting as Defense Planning Committee)
                        and business to come before the full Ministerial Council with French
                        present. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed
                        preference for following order: First half-day, the full Council for
                        ceremonial opening and to begin traditional tour d'horizon; afternoon of
                        first day and morning of the following day, meeting of the Fourteen
                        Ministers as <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>; afternoon of second day
                        and, as necessary, morning of third day full Council to resume
                        deliberations. </p>
                    <p>4. Foregoing was discussed on assumption that Special Committee would meet in
                        Paris just prior to Ministerial. One of main points emphasized by Brosio was
                        the <gloss target="#t_SPECOM1">SPECOM</gloss> report to Ministers should be
                        addressed to <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. He made clear his view
                        that this procedure should be followed both on organizational aspects of
                            <gloss target="#t_SPECOM1">SPECOM</gloss> and on political consultation
                        aspects growing out of Italian proposal. In Brosio's view it is important to
                        watch the precedents now that NATO has found pragmatic solution to
                        “constitutional problem” arising out of French withdrawal. Therefore he
                        considered it important that <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> take
                        decisions on Special Committee, leaving it up to French to raise any
                        questions they wish in full Council. We expressed preliminary agreement with
                        this view. </p>
                    <p>5. East-West Issues in NATO. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        repeatedly emphasized his belief that, while NATO powers should do what is
                        possible to improve <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0524"/>atmosphere of
                        relations with Eastern Europe and USSR, NATO work on matters of interest to
                        Germany should parallel further progress on detente. He considered this
                        absolutely essential for stability of Europe and Atlantic area. </p>
                    <p>6. On specific matters now under consideration in NATO, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consideration of <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>s
                        report is now well advanced; that, in his opinion, UK proposed declaration
                        on Europe is not apt to give significant results but also not apt to cause
                        great problems. He indicated there would be problems with some of the
                        Fourteen on a special Declaration on East-West relations, primarily because
                        of French reservation. He thought more likely result would be a section in
                        the regular communique. US pointed out that French might well reserve even
                        on communique language in this area and that we did not wish now to
                        foreclose possibility of a special NATO Declaration in December or
                        subsequently. </p>
                    <p>7. France-NATO Problems. In addition to French attitude on East-West issues
                        (which he regretted), <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> also
                        commented on general French policy. He expressed personal view that French
                        policy is incompatible with spirit of the Alliance on two fundamental
                        points: (a) its interpretation of Article V of the Treaty, and (b) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s concept of “Atlantic to the
                        Urals” which implies inclusion of USSR in Europe and exclusion of US from
                        European affairs. He nevertheless stressed view that it would be most unwise
                        and dangerous to push showdown on this point. Wiser course was pragmatic
                        approach that has been followed to date. </p>
                    <p>8. On French forces in Germany, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        thought French Government was in no hurry and would be prepared to let
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGBC1">Ailleret</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> conversations proceed at
                        leisurely pace. He did not believe this should be an issue at Ministerial
                        Meeting. </p>
                    <p>9. NATO Force Planning. Brosio recalled that NATO had accelerated force
                        planning. He expressed view that, given problems in trilaterals (notably
                        German political situation), NATO should probably slow down its effort
                        somewhat but in framework of present accelerated timetable; i.e. not
                        returning to previous schedule. </p>
                    <p>10. On general question of force levels and defense burdens, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and other US participants
                        emphasized to Brosio the increasingly difficult character of our domestic
                        political problem. Essentially two points were made: (a) especially at time
                        when US is carrying heavy burden for free world in Vietnam, US Congress and
                        public opinion is increasingly restive at European failure to carry its
                        share of the load in defense of NATO area; (b) European governments seem to
                        be speaking with two voices. Foreign and Defense Ministers are anxious for
                        US to keep up its military strength. Finance Ministers and central bankers
                        keep urging us to correct US balance of payments problem. There needs to be
                        a <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0525"/>better link in Alliance affairs
                        between political-military issues on one hand and financial and monetary
                        issue on the other. </p>
                    <p>11. Special Committee. Reviewing difficulties in deciding on composition of
                        Nuclear Planning Group, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he
                        had recently received reply to letter he sent Luns urging more flexible
                        Netherlands position. Reply hinted at some give in Dutch attitude but was
                        couched in such terms that Netherlands could move in any direction it wished
                        at Ministerial. The Turks remained a problem because they wanted a
                        seven-member NPG. In <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s view
                        Canada was most difficult problem of all. Canada did not even accept the
                        principle of four permanent members for NPG unless Canada were included.
                        Problem in <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s view is
                        essentially political and psychological. Despite validity of Canada's claim
                        to play a significant role in NATO nuclear affairs, another European country
                        is needed in NPG to build in balance to Germany. </p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President: </p>
                    <p>I have completed the review of our NATO policy which you asked me to
                        undertake in your letter delivered to me on October 7.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">Not found. </note> I enclose my report herewith. </p>
                    <p>Within the time available, I have sought to obtain and analyze as much data
                        and thinking in the Government bearing on the problem as I could. In doing
                        so, I have had the full cooperation of the Secretaries of State, Defense and
                        Treasury, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the CIA, as well as
                        many other officials of the Government who are charged with responsibilities
                        related to the subject of my inquiry. They have made available many studies
                        and reports bearing on my report, prepared in their Departments and
                        Agencies. Members of their staffs have assisted in various ways, including
                        preparing special studies for my benefit. </p>
                    <p>I have been much impressed with the dedication of the staffs and the quality
                        of their work. Without this help it would have been quite impossible <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0526"/>to carry out the assigned task. For
                        all of this assistance, I am very grateful. </p>
                    <p>In the course of my studies, I have found unanimity among all the responsible
                        officials that NATO is vital to the security of the United States, and I
                        have proceeded on that assumption. </p>
                    <p>In conducting my review, I have confined myself essentially to the strength
                        of the ground and air forces of NATO for the Central Front as the question
                        of United States force levels is related to such forces. Accordingly, I have
                        not dealt with naval forces or those which have been committed to the
                        northern and southern flanks of NATO.</p>
                    <p>During my consideration of these matters, there occurred the collapse of the
                        Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, an event which complicated an
                        already complex task. Representatives of the German Government have
                        continued to cooperate fully in an exchange of views and data, but the lack
                        of a government in Bonn may delay our progress considerably. Insofar as any
                        decisions by the Federal Republic bear on fiscal matters, it may, therefore,
                        be some time before we can complete our tripartite review. Indeed, for the
                        same reason, my own report to you on this aspect of our study cannot be as
                        definite as it might otherwise have been. </p>
                    <p>To present my thoughts to you as simply and briefly as possible—and in a
                        manner that I trust will assist decision-making—I have led off with: </p>

                    <p rend="center">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>1. NATO continues to be indispensable for European security and
                        stability—interests vital to the US. (Section A) </p>
                    <p>2. The strategy of flexible response, backed by adequate conventional, as
                        well as nuclear capabilities, is essential for balanced defense and
                        effective deterrence under present conditions. (Section B) </p>
                    <p>3. Existing NATO conventional forces for the Central Region are adequate in
                        size to support a flexible response strategy, though certain imbalances and
                        deficiencies need correction. (Section B) </p>
                    <p>4. Any material reduction in US forces will probably trigger Allied force
                        cuts. The cumulative effect could reduce substantially NATO conventional
                        capability to support a flexible response strategy and lower the nuclear
                        threshold. While the effect of such cuts on the deterrent cannot be assessed
                        with precision, they could enhance to some degree the risk of Soviet
                        pressures or actions at lower levels, especially in view of the growing
                        Soviet strategic nuclear strength. (Section C) </p>
                    <p>5. With our existing capacity for deploying forces from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> to Europe, the time required to return
                        any forces withdrawn to the US <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0528"/>would make them much less effective than forces in place in Europe in
                        terms of the flexible response strategy and the deterrent. The time required
                        to deploy ground forces can be substantially reduced during the next several
                        years by major expenditures for duplicate equipment, facilities, and
                        necessary readiness. With such improvements, reinforcement would still take
                        at least three weeks. (Section C) </p>
                    <p>6. Politically, any material withdrawal of US forces from Europe, in its
                        present unsettled state, would seriously increase the risks of NATO
                        disintegration and reduction of US influence in Europe. (Section D) </p>
                    <p>7. The extent to which Germany will be prepared to provide future offsets for
                        US military expenditures in Germany will be uncertain until a new German
                        Government gains a solid footing. The prospects for offsets should be
                        improved by—(a) relating their amount to the net foreign exchange gain to
                        the Federal Republic from the US military expenditures in Germany; (b)
                        expanding the forms of offset to include non-military purchases, as well as
                        neutralizing by financial means; and (c) relating the offset obligations to
                        the state of the US and German balance of payments. (Section E)</p>
                    <p>8. The US has an interest in the continued maintenance of UK forces in
                        Germany for their effect on the cohesion of NATO and the position of the UK
                        in Europe. (Section F) </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. I recommend, for the political and military reasons outlined, that the US
                        should not withdraw any significant forces from the Central Region in Europe
                        under current conditions. </p>
                    <p>2. I recommend that the US explore with the Government of the Federal
                        Republic new arrangements to neutralize balance of payments effects of US
                        expenditures in Germany: </p>
                    <p>(a) to the extent of net gains to the German balance of payments; </p>
                    <p>(b) by means of military purchases, other additive purchases, and appropriate
                        financial devices; and </p>
                    <p>(c) subject to the general state of US and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> balance of payments. </p>
                    <p>3. I recommend that the US explore with the UK and the Federal Republic of
                        Germany how the UK can be enabled to retain on the Central Front its present
                        level of forces. </p>
                    <p>4. I recommend that the US continue to encourage its NATO Allies to provide
                        reasonable stocks, equipment, support and reserves for forces in conformity
                        with a flexible response strategy. </p>

                    <p>1. After day's discussions with British Ministers and officials ending in
                        meetings with Callaghan <note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"> James Callaghan,
                            British Minister of Finance and member of the Privy Council.</note>

                        Callaghan together in which all points in three messages between President
                        and Prime Minister<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">The three messages are <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref> and an exchange of messages on
                            November 18 and 19. In his November 18 message, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> thanked the President for his
                            offer of $35 million and suggested that since Rostow was visiting London
                            the next week, he might be used to iron out the details. (Department of
                            State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D
                            327) In his November 19 letter, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> agreed to having Rostow discuss the problem, but
                            reminded the Prime Minister that any arrangement would have to be
                            approved by Congress. (Ibid.) </note> were intensively canvassed, Prime
                        Minister authorized me to tell you that he accepts the President's proposal
                        ad referendum to the Cabinet on the understanding (a) that “concert” means
                        we move together but does not give us a veto, and (b) that Britain is now
                        committing itself to a delay of about six months. Beyond that point
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> insists that Britain would
                        not settle for anything less than full coverage of its exchange costs in
                        Germany. Wilson expressed hope US procurement would not be for
                        petroleum—with its high import content—and Callaghan urged us if possible to
                        put orders that would create employment in Britain. </p>
                    <p>2. I made clear US cannot promise that trilateral talks will come out with
                        recommendation for troop and stock withdrawals. I expressed hope we could
                        wind up the trilaterals within six months, but said that difficulties
                        inherent in the talks made a strict timetable impossible. I warned Wilson it
                        might be damaging or impossible to insist on 100 percent coverage. </p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> said he could go ahead on
                        this basis and would reply to President after Cabinet decision. We agreed
                        this arrangement should be kept secret for present. US and UK should work
                        out time and mode of announcement, which could well be made at NATO
                        Ministerial Meeting next month. </p>

                    <p>7885. During my call at the Elysee today I asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> if there was anything he could tell me as to his
                        view of France's relationship to the Alliance and NATO in the coming years.
                        He said he envisaged France's relations with NATO becoming “more and more
                        difficult” as time passed. He said the organization of the Alliance had been
                        set up to deal with the threat of war but it was not to be expected that
                        this semi-state of mobilization could be carried on when the threat of war
                        was visibly diminishing. However, he said that France would remain in the
                        Alliance since the danger had not been totally eliminated, and there was
                        also he added the question of Germany: it was preferable to have Germany
                        inside a Western Alliance. In his view however he felt that NATO as an
                        organization would be progressively weakened as time passed and as the
                        danger receded. He repeated when I raised again the question that France had
                        no intention of withdrawing as matters now stood in the world.</p>

                    <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0531"/>
                    <p>1. Primarily as result of Belgian initiative with US (reftels), Dept has been
                        considering desirability and feasibility of NATO Ministers in December
                        commissioning a major study on future of Alliance. Briefly, US like many
                        European countries is concerned with need to articulate up-to-date role for
                        the Alliance; to assure its continued relevance to improved East-West
                        relations in line with the President's October 7 speech;<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">See <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note> and,
                        against background of French withdrawal and approach of 1969, to assure
                        continued governmental and public understanding and support for goals of
                        Western cohesion and deterrent strength of Alliance.</p>
                    <p>2. Tactically, we prefer that initiative on this problem come from Europe.
                        Belgian suggestion is most helpful from this standpoint. As to content, we
                        believe any new study should concentrate on political and non-military side
                        of NATO and Atlantic policies.</p>
                    <p>3. We are convinced that questions of strategic doctrine, force levels and
                        deployment, and nuclear planning should continue to be handled in existing
                        framework. A new study might take note of NATO progress on these issues to
                        provide balance and necessary background for a report to Ministers. Terms of
                        reference should not however provide for any independent substantive study
                        of these matters.</p>
                    <p>4. Among the many problems in formulating and getting underway a study on
                        future of the Alliance is method and timing of approach to Germans.
                        Immediate question is whether in time remaining before the December
                        Ministerial meeting, the existing German Government or a new one can take
                        decision to go along with study. If not, it might be better simply to have
                        ideas advanced in December with final decision to be taken subsequently by
                        the Permanent Council or by Ministers in the spring. We think it highly
                        unlikely study could be a success without full German cooperation from the
                        outset.</p>
                    <p>5. In light of Belgian suggestions and our own thinking we have concluded
                        that a NATO decision in December or subsequently might embody the following
                        elements:</p>
                    <p>a. Ministers should ask Brosio and the Permanent Council to undertake a
                        thorough study of broad policies, activities and organization relating to
                        NATO's non-military functions. In part this would be a follow-up to existing
                        work on East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>b. The study should be completed in time for action to be taken at the
                        December 1967 Ministerial meeting. We doubt that work of this scope and
                        importance could be gotten underway and completed in time for Ministerial
                        consideration next spring.</p>
                    <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and the Permanent Council
                        could be assisted by senior officials from capitals and, subject to limits
                        explained below, by consultation <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0532"/>with independent experts or public figures having a suitable background in
                        Atlantic and international affairs. As a variant of this idea, creation of a
                        special commission might be envisaged. Membership in such a commission would
                        be open to all NATO countries. Governments could designate either special
                        representatives or their NATO Permanent Representatives to sit on the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>d. The work might be organized under several main headings. The following
                        seem logical to us but we recognize that other variations may be
                        preferred.</p>
                    <p>(1) Improving East-West Relations. This might be essentially a development
                        from the present NATO exercise. It would concentrate on such areas as
                        contacts, cultural affairs and economic relations—with a view to seeing how
                        these could be handled so as not only to improve East-West relations but
                        also encourage constructive change in the East. Independent experts could be
                        helpful on these aspects.</p>
                    <p>(2) European Security and the German Problem. This field must be reserved to
                        governments and take due account of quadripartite responsibilities.
                        Therefore outside experts should not be used for this part of the study.</p>
                    <p>(3) General Atlantic and European Relations. Work in this area could
                        concentrate on such things as a restatement of the principles of Atlantic
                        cooperation and their relationship to Western European unification.
                        Independent experts and public figures might be consulted on these
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>(4) Organization of NATO. Under this heading there could be a reexamination
                        of Alliance machinery in light of recommendations made under the three
                        preceding headings. Outside advice could also be sought on these
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>6. For Brussels: As follow-up to Under Secretary Rostow's talks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> B), please inform Belgian Govt that
                        we are grateful for ideas in Belgian memorandum; that our study has resulted
                        in tentative points outlined in para five above which have been developed
                        with benefit of Belgian ideas; and that we assume they will be taking
                        soundings with other key NATO countries. You should also make clear we will
                        probably be talking with others informally to clarify our own views. We wish
                        to emphasize however that any such discussions would not involve preempting
                        this important Belgian initiative. Please ascertain whether Belgians see any
                        problem in our referring to fact they have raised subject with us and noting
                        that they may be making a proposal in connection with the Ministerial.
                        Meanwhile, we shall be giving further thought to entire subject, including
                        the detailed points in body of Belgian memorandum.</p>
                    <p>7. For Bonn and London: As soon as we have results of approach to Belgians we
                        expect to take soundings with UK and Federal Republic.</p>
                    <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0533"/>
                    <p>8. For <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>: We hope to provide guidance for
                        action with other NATO delegations as soon as we have results of soundings
                        with Belgium, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and UK. Meanwhile, we
                        think it important to avoid any general NATO discussion of matters covered
                        in this message.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> said that he
                        wished to raise very briefly the question of composition of the Nuclear
                        Planning Group. The matter will have to be decided within the next two weeks
                        and he wanted the Secretary to understand fully the vital importance to the
                        Italian Government of obtaining permanent Italian membership in the NPG. The
                        Secretary was of course aware of the great difficulties that would be caused
                        in Europe by a decision which upset the balance among major countries of
                        Western Europe. The Ambassador stated that three years ago, when the
                        question of possible expansion of the NATO Standing Group was under
                        consideration, he had been given firm assurances here that the group would
                        not be expanded to include Germany without also including Italy. In the
                        present circumstances in Europe and in light of the current domestic
                        political scene in Italy it is now even more important that Italy receive
                        the same status as the other major NATO members.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said that he was well aware of Italian views on this matter and
                        wished to reassure the Ambassador that there had been no change in the U.S.
                        position of firm support for Italy as a permanent member of the NPG.</p>

                    <p>The December 1966 Ministerial Meeting will take place in an atmosphere of
                        transition and ferment. Western Europe remains a collection of relatively
                        weak sovereign nations. While economic progress continues, the move towards
                        political unity has been stalled, and each nation seeks to maintain a
                        balance in its immediate environment, avoid entanglement in global problems
                        and ensure its security. The traditional European leaders (a neutralist
                        France, a weak, self-centered UK and a Germany governed by an untested
                        coalition) are unable to provide reassurance to the other Alliance members.
                        The latter are uneasy about the evolving balance of power (i.e., read
                        Germany) in Western Europe, unready to abandon NATO's security but unwilling
                        to contribute a larger share to its defense effort, uneasy about the US
                        commitment to the Alliance and our increasing involvement in Viet Nam, and
                        interested but uncertain about how to capitalize on the apparent detente in
                        East-West relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Alliance</p>
                    <p>Despite these uncertainties the Alliance in 1966 has met <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s challenge. The Fourteen, who
                        formalized their determination to maintain NATO at the Brussels Meeting in
                        June, have in large part sorted out the France-NATO relationship. They are
                        prepared to have France participate in NATO activities so long as she pays
                        her share and does not try to obstruct the others. But France has
                        effectively bowed out of almost all military aspects of the Alliance and in
                        the process has made it increasingly clear how tenuous is her claim to be
                        “the ally of her allies” and how <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0535"/>determinedly she is bent on an independent course tantamount to
                        neutralism.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the French position, the Fourteen recognize more clearly the
                        benefits provided by NATO for which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> offered no substitute: (a) security (the Soviet
                        machine is still there and NATO's joint defense effort is the only effective
                        protection against possible Russian encroachment or blackmail); (b) Western
                        European political stability (this looks ever more precious to them in the
                        light of the recent German political shifts); and (c) political influence
                        (they see the NATO consultation process as their best hope of securing US
                        attention to their interests and objections, and indeed Russian respect for
                        them). An evidence of this need for and support of NATO is the fact that
                        they are now prepared to take the decisive forward step to make the Special
                        Committee on nuclear planning into a permanent NATO institution (the NATO
                        Defense Affairs Committee) in spite of past French opposition.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, there are serious strains in the Alliance. European confidence
                        in a solid US commitment to NATO has been weakened not only by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s unremitting attacks and
                        innuendoes, but also by events in the US like the Mansfield Resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref target="#d199">Document
                            199</ref>.</note> and the periodic Washington intimations linking
                        withdrawals to manpower needs in the Pacific or balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>At the same time the detente atmosphere has fostered heavy public and
                        parliamentary pressures to relax NATO defense efforts. Some nations (such as
                        the UK and Belgium) are already looking for ways to rationalize defense
                        reductions. Others are prepared to follow. NATO strategy and force levels
                        are under scrutiny in the Trilateral talks as well as in NATO force planning
                        studies. Further progress in both areas is delayed until the US, UK and the
                        new German government are ready to take some vital policy decisions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The East-West Aspect</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere of detente has also spurred the NATO nations to an intense and
                        occasionally uncritical pursuit of improved East-West relations. Thoughtful
                        examination within NATO during 1966 of bilateral activities and future
                        possibilities revealed a considerable variety of views. The Scandinavians
                        and Belgians were optimistic as to possibilities of future developments. The
                        Greeks, Turks and Germans viewed the situation with considerable reserve,
                        feeling that the attitudes of some of their Allies underestimated the
                        continuing Soviet threat as a bar to detente. The French have disassociated
                        themselves from any concerted NATO position.</p>
                    <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0536"/>
                    <p>In essence, the Allies recognize NATO's real value and indispensability as
                        long as the basic problems of peace and of European security and German
                        reunification have not been resolved—but they are searching more insistently
                        for ways to adapt NATO to changing conditions and enlarge its
                        usefulness.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Objectives</p>
                    <p>Our general objectives at the December Ministerial Meeting will be:</p>
                    <p>a) to present the picture of an Organization and of an Alliance which has
                        surmounted its crisis with France but which will continue to accept French
                        cooperation to the extent this does not damage essential NATO interests.</p>
                    <p>b) to demonstrate that the Fourteen are going ahead in a businesslike manner,
                        modernizing NATO to meet their needs—in the defense structure, in the
                        nuclear field and in the area of communications and crisis consultation as
                        well as in the non-military fields.</p>
                    <p>c) to demonstrate that, in spite of a reduced probability of war in Europe,
                        the nature of the Soviet threat still calls for an effective NATO.</p>
                    <p>d) to evidence that a strong Alliance is an essential prerequisite to the
                        attainment of a genuine detente and an equitable settlement in Europe.</p>
                    <p>e) to support European efforts to study the future organization and
                        activities of NATO.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Organization of the Meeting</p>
                    <p>As a result of a “constitutional” arrangement which was recently agreed in
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, the Fourteen, sitting as the
                        Defense Planning Committee, conduct the Alliance's military business and the
                        Fifteen conduct its non-military business. Thus in December for the first
                        time in NATO history business will be formally divided between these two
                        groups, meeting at the Ministerial level.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Work of the Council of Fourteen (<gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Specifically we hope that the Ministers of the Fourteen will accomplish the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>1. Note the favorable progress made since last June in resolving the
                        France-NATO relationship. We are midstream in relocating <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AFCENT1">AFCENT</gloss> and the NATO Defense College. NATO has taken the last
                        remaining major relocation decisions, to move the Military Committee and the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to Brussels. Some Ministers may wish
                        to examine the details of financing and timing for moves; the actual work
                        would normally be left to the Fourteen PermReps. At this point there appear
                        to be no tendentious issues with France on matters relating to its
                        withdrawal from NATO. Politely and publicly, NATO is leaving France.</p>
                    <p>2. Approve the Special Committee reports which (a) would make the Special
                        Committee and six-nation Nuclear Planning Group into permanent NATO
                        institutions for nuclear consultation, and (b) set in train <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0537"/>arrangements for improved data exchange and
                        communications and for crisis consultation. This will be a major
                        accomplishment and dramatic evidence that the NATO nations are moving to
                        give substance to their common interests in the nuclear area—in spite of
                        past French objections and the deep-seated reservations of NATO nations
                        about smaller or inner groupings.</p>
                    <p>3. Note the report of the US–UK–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        Trilateral talks and recognize that the original time table for winding them
                        up, mid-January, has slipped. Any concern by Ministers over the slippage
                        should be balanced by relief that the UK is willing to defer precipitate
                        action with regard to the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> and by the
                        recognition that this interim trilateral report is sufficiently
                        comprehensive to permit the regular NATO force planning to proceed in
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>4. Provide the necessary guidance for the NATO military authorities to push
                        on with their studies and activities on aspects of strategy and force
                        posture, looking toward a full examination of these matters at a special
                        Defense Ministers' meeting in the spring or at the next regular Ministerial
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>5. Express their interest in and support for the DefComSat proposal which
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> is now studying. It will not be
                        ready for final action at the Ministerial.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Work of the Council of Fifteen</p>
                    <p>We hope that the Ministers of the Fifteen will undertake the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Consider thoughtfully Belgium's proposal for a NATO study on the political
                        future of the Alliance and instruct Brosio and the Permanent Council to work
                        out and recommend to governments procedures for a productive study. It would
                        be premature to expect a more decisive response at this stage since the
                        Ministers will have had little or no time to consider the fundamental
                        objectives and potentialities of this initiative.</p>
                    <p>2. Welcome Italy's proposals in NATO for dealing with the “technological gap”
                        and encourage her to refine her ideas.</p>
                    <p>3. Endorse the Permanent Representatives' report which examines possible
                        initiatives looking toward improved East-West relations. The French are
                        expected to abstain, being opposed in principle to any evidence of concerted
                        Western “bloc” activity.</p>
                    <p>4. Stress as fundamental to the East-West problem that (a) Western strength
                        and cohesion is a precondition to improved East-West relationships, (b)
                        progress toward detente and progress towards the solution of the German and
                        Central European problems are complementary objectives, both of which we
                        support, and (c) the foregoing are a part of the determined search for ways
                        to build a “surer foundation of mutual trust” <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0538"/>between East and West which the President advocated in his
                        speech on October 7.</p>

                    <p>Under Secretary Rostow opened the conversation by briefing Senator Mansfield
                        on the tripartite talks on the NATO troop strength and offset problem in
                        Germany being conducted for the United States by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>. He explained why, if we were to
                        avoid the danger of a serious unravelling of the NATO Alliance, it seemed
                        necessary to authorize $35 million of additional defense procurement in the
                        UK in order to gain necessary time to study this entire problem and reach a
                        sound conclusion with the British and Germans, both of whom have a serious
                        domestic problem He also explained some of the possibilities we are
                        exploring to neutralize the adverse balance of payments effect of troops
                        abroad as well as the commitments that Britain would make in return for our
                        additional procurement.</p>
                    <p>Senator Mansfield listened impassively and at the conclusion of Under
                        Secretary Rostow's presentation said that the resolution which he had put
                        forward in the last Congress calling for a reduction of our forces in Europe
                        was a very serious one and had widespread appeal in the Congress. He pointed
                        out that we are the only NATO country that is meeting its commitments,
                        except possibly for some withdrawals for Vietnam, and that he had offered
                        the resolution not just for financial and balance of payments reasons,
                        important as they were, nor because of Vietnam. Basically <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0539"/>he felt there were clear indications that
                        fundamental changes had taken place and that the continued presence of so
                        many American troops in Europe 20 years after the war was beginning to grate
                        on the nerves of Germans and Europeans outside of government. He felt in
                        terms of our own overall political and security stance the time had come to
                        make a reduction in forces.</p>
                    <p>Senator Mansfield said that his resolution in no way weakened the President's
                        hand since it left to the President the judgment on the extent to which
                        there should be U.S. troop reductions as well as the timing. He believed his
                        resolution actually strengthened the President's hand in these matters
                        rather than weakening it.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as the proposed arrangements with the British to place $35 million of
                        additional defense procurement are concerned, he did not think it was a good
                        idea to “subsidize the British” unless the end result would strengthen our
                        overall security arrangements and the position of the dollar and the pound
                        sterling—as a result which he obviously considered very dubious.</p>
                    <p>He concluded the conversation on this subject by saying cryptically that he
                        appreciated being informed and thought “we understand each other's viewpoint
                        on this matter.”</p>

                            report<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>/D(66)39, “Suggested Improvements for
                            Nuclear Planning,” a report of the Special Committee of Defense
                            Ministers. (Ibid., Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF 113)</note>
                        secures Ministerial approval next week. NATO, through the <gloss target="#t_DPWG1">DPWG</gloss>, has made good progress down the road
                        toward rational and meaningful planning for conventional forces. The
                        pressing need has <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0540"/>been to extend
                        this systematic approach to problems which have faced us for a decade in the
                        nuclear field. By establishing a small and flexible nuclear planning group,
                        NATO will have, at last, machinery which will enable Ministers to grapple
                        with the substance of Alliance nuclear planning and policy.</p>
                    <p>2. In the NPG's first year, no task is more urgent or important than to begin
                        to fill in great void which surrounds question of the role of 7,000 nuclear
                        warheads in Europe and their proper relation to external and conventional
                        forces. Our objective is to strive for some understanding, and hopefully
                        agreement, about what kinds of nuclear weapons are needed in NATO, in what
                        amounts and for what purposes.</p>
                    <p>3. In our view, a good approach would be to divide the problem of the role of
                        NATO's nuclear forces into its strategic and tactical components. Putting
                        the NPG to work simultaneously on both the strategic and tactical phases of
                        these problems would avoid distortion inherent in focusing on one aspect
                        alone and would permit development of a coherent view of the appropriate
                        balance and mix of NATO's nuclear forces and their relationship to external
                        strategic forces.</p>
                    <p>4. In the strategic category we would envisage the NPG starting out on ground
                        already prepared by Working Group III and going on to a thorough examination
                        of the targeting politics, tasks and objectives of NATO strike forces. By
                        taking advantage of consensus already developed in Working Group III
                        concerning <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s scheduled program,
                        there would be good chance that NPG could produce an agreed NATO targeting
                        and attack policy at an early date. Such a prompt outcome would not only
                        establish prestige of NPG (thereby undercutting FRG doubts about its value)
                        but would also in another way demonstrate Alliance is up to date and
                        vital.</p>
                    <p>5. On the tactical side, we would see the NPG beginning with studies of the
                        possible use of battlefield nuclear weapons (tubes, missiles, aircraft) and
                        of denial and defense nuclear weapons (AA, <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>). This ground-up
                        approach to tactical systems has the advantage of immersing NPG at outset in
                        systematic examination of some problems of principal concern to its members.
                        It would also lead to more informed and orderly consideration of such
                        problems as selective use, command and control, rules of engagement, special
                        release procedures, contingency studies, etc.</p>
                    <p>6. We understand that as soon as NPG formally comes to life (which should be
                        next week) UK intends to raise question of the first steps to be taken. To
                        get off to a brisk start, and in the right direction, it would be useful to
                        arrange toward end of Ministerial Session a meeting of the six Defense
                        Ministers who will be participating in NPG during 1967.</p>
                    <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0541"/>
                    <p>7. There may be political obstacles that make this too difficult. The six
                        ministers can hardly meet (even if there is already a firm gentlemen's
                        agreement) until they have been formally selected by the (probably
                        twelve-member) <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>. Since <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> is chairman of both <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> and NPG, he needs to be present
                        especially the first time each body meets; yet he will be chairing North
                        Atlantic Council during this period. Probably we can and should do nothing
                        about this idea until the <gloss target="#t_SPECOM1">SPECOM</gloss> report
                        has been considered and approved; backfield in motion might draw penalty of
                        resentment. But once action is taken hopefully in final form at <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> Wednesday, then we can see whether the
                        formalities can be sufficiently complied with to enable us to get to work on
                        the substance of a work program.</p>
                    <p>8. We have some specific suggestions for work program (following general line
                        in 2–5 above), for discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> when that moment comes.</p>

                    <p>The technological gap, the nature of which is not clear.</p>
                    <p>At a forthcoming NATO meeting in Paris next week, we do not expect dramatic

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Nuclear
                        Planning Group, which we are developing, meets the needs of our allies,
                        especially Germany. It will more closely tie in Germany with the U.S. and
                        the U.K. in the nuclear field. It will end talk of the Multilateral
                        Force.</p>
                    <p>As for tripartite discussions, it is doubtful that the Germans will present a
                        proposal acceptable to us and to the British with respect to the troop
                        offset problem. This means that there will have to be a relocation of U.S.
                        and U.K. forces. We must act to keep the British from suddenly withdrawing
                        U.K. troops.</p>
                    <p>As to the relocation of our forces outside France, 90 percent of our
                        personnel will be out by April 1. The remainder will be out by mid-summer.
                        The cost of getting out of France we do not yet know.</p>
                    <p>The President: Let us get out rather than be pushed out by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Estimates of the
                        cost of getting out range from $175 to $275 million. Some 75,000 Americans,
                        plus 14,000 French civilians on the U.S. payroll are involved. Foreign
                        exchange costs to us may drop from $175 million to $100 million, a yearly
                        saving of about $75 million.</p>
                    <p>The President: Expressed general agreement with the State Department paper.
                        We should get out of France as quickly as possible. If we cannot meet the
                        French deadline for withdrawal, we should avoid a public fight about it if
                        we can. As soon as our team returns from the Paris meeting, they should
                        report their evaluation of whether the 14 NATO powers can hold together.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>: We should
                        await the results of the <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        mission sometime in mid-January to make up our minds on the level of U.S.
                        forces remaining in Europe. We must be very careful of the political effect
                        in Europe off any withdrawal we make. We must reach an agreed government
                        position on whether we think the allies are carrying their fair share in
                        relation to what we are doing. This position will be essential in defending
                        our policy domestically.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: The
                        allies' view of the Soviet threat is such that they are not willing to make
                        adequate force contributions. Our allies face the difficult problem of not
                        wanting to accept de Gaulle's solution but not wanting to pay for a NATO
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>The President: Recent French, British and German actions make clear that they
                        are looking inward. We can't get the American people to support our NATO
                        policy when they see the actions taken by the French, British, and Germans.
                        We are fast approaching a day of reckoning. Our recent elections make this
                        quite clear. Our policy must take into account the diminishing support of
                        U.S. citizens for the present level of our forces in Europe.</p>
                    <p>We should do our very best to comply with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s request that we leave—even if it means putting men
                        in inadequate housing during <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0543"/>winter. We should try to get through to the Germans to convince them of
                        the necessity of offsetting a greater amount of our expenditures in Europe.
                        The serious nature of the problem we face in maintaining support for NATO
                        must be conveyed to the allies. They must understand that the demands on us
                        to meet home front needs are serious—that we are facing a budget of 142
                        billion with revenue estimates of 120 billion. The labor unions are going to
                        get raises and U.S. Government employees merit salary increases.
                        Expenditures for the poor in the U.S. have increased tremendously since the
                        Kennedy Administration. We are now very near a debt limit.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: The NATO alliance is vital. However, changes are
                        necessary. The dissolution of the alliance means the loss of our diplomatic
                        cards in dealing with the Russians. We must talk to Congress every chance we
                        get about the continuing but changed NATO structure.</p>

                        Secretary and Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> from
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>. I have had only the
                        briefest opportunity to discuss these matters with Defense but thought you
                        might like to have my personal views in the event the question is raised
                        during Secretary's stay in Paris.</p>
                    <p>1. As suggested in paragraph 1 of reftel A, I believe it would be highly
                        desirable to sell the French the equipment and installations on various air
                        bases in France wherever such sales would be to the economic advantage of
                        the US. This would give us a dollar return and might also speed up our time
                        of departure from France thus helping us to meet the <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0544"/>April 1 date. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will no doubt inform Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> there is an intense interest
                        here in getting out as soon as possible and avoiding any disagreement with
                        the French over US delays.</p>
                    <p>2. Frankly, I see no advantage and some clear disadvantages in attempting at
                        this moment to re-engage the French in a discussion of US use of military
                        facilities in France. We may be certain that if they have to foot the bill
                        they will in fact maintain only such facilities as they intend to use in any
                        case. Presumably if France is at our side in an emergency or hostilities we
                        would at that time be permitted to use these facilities. If we now suggest
                        that we have an interest in their maintaining specific facilities they might
                        very well demand some payment from us, such as, for example, free or
                        cut-rate sales to them of existing equipment and installations on the theory
                        that these facilities are of potential use to us even though in fact they
                        had decided to keep these facilities for their own purposes. Finally,
                        protracted discussion of this subject with the French could lead to
                        additional delays in our departure and possibly a further exacerbation of
                        our relations on this entire question.</p>
                    <p>3. The disadvantages cited in paragraph 2 would not necessarily apply at a
                        later stage after we have left France and have sold them whatever equipment
                        and installations we jointly decide upon. At that point we could simply
                        present them with a list of the facilities which they had already decided to
                        maintain and to which we might want access, with their approval in time of
                        emergency or hostilities in which they concur, simply in order to facilitate
                        planning. An approach at this later stage would avoid presenting them with
                        an excuse for demanding payment and would not engage us in a request for
                        some “commitment” on their part.</p>
                    <p>It would also avoid political disadvantages mentioned at end State

                    <p>1. Secretary met December 13 with NATO Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> accompanied by Bacchetti (NATO
                        International Staff). In addition to Secretary, Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGSJ1">Springsteen</persName> and Vest were present from U.S.</p>
                    <p>2. Nuclear Planning Group membership. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was worried about Dutch attitude and uncertain
                        whether exhibition of bad temper resulted from grudges against U.S. or was
                        pre-meeting tactics. Luns inconsistently on one hand had said that Dutch
                        might not even want to participate in <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>
                        and on the other had suggested need for a basic three-year tenure as minimum
                        time in which NPG member could do meaningful work. Secretary said we
                        prepared to proceed without Dutch if necessary. He was ready to talk to Luns
                        but thought others like UK and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        could be more helpful in influencing Dutch. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed and said he would probe extent of German
                        interest (which influential factor with Dutch always), talk to Dutch PermRep
                        and press British to use their influence. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he had urged Martin, who had agreed, to talk
                        directly to Luns and try to settle first year's position between two of
                        them. Brosio asked whether U.S. insisted on six or would go to seven if that
                        was the only way to have committee. Secretary preferred to wait and see what
                        situation required.</p>
                    <p>3. Belgian initiative for study of Alliance. Secretary reviewed Belgian
                        resolution and said we should avoid phrase “state of Alliance,” which
                        implies it not in good shape, and use term “tasks of Alliance.” Re Belgian
                        draft resolution, he preferred term “situation in Asia and Pacific” to term
                        “situation in Southeast Asia” and thought there should be additional item
                        “the continuing problem of organizing a durable peace.” He made point that
                        U.S. would prefer to have <gloss target="#t_SecGen1">SecGen</gloss> and
                        Council arrange with governments for an inquiry. This would invite higher
                        political representation from capitals than PermReps although he did not
                        exclude that activities should take place at the NATO Council table.</p>
                    <p>4. communique. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said that French
                        PermRep de Leusse on personal basis had suggested single communique which
                        would report work of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> and of full <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and conclude with statement that French did
                        not participate in or associate themselves with DPC paragraphs. Secretary
                        underlined importance of having clear commitment from the French by the time
                        meeting got underway that both Parts could appear in one document and that
                            <gloss target="#t_SecGen1">SecGen</gloss>'s rep could brief press at
                        conclusion of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> discussions. If the French
                        gave no guarantee, then Fourteen should put out own written report.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed and suggested that
                        at the beginning of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> session Ministers
                        should appoint a communique drafting committee as usual to prepare paper
                        which could either be incorporated in single final communique or be issued
                        at close of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> business, dependent on
                        needs. (See following bilateral tels re this subject.)</p>
                    <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0546"/>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> relocation. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said most nations favored building permanent new
                        headquarters in Brussels but disagreed on interim arrangements. Choice was
                        to lease Tour de Namur, build prefabricated tempo in Brussels, or stay in
                        Paris until permanent building available. There was some opposition to
                        leasing Tour, but cost of building tempo would be more than rent of Tour and
                        he thought Tour was least bad solution. Secretary said U.S. would defer to
                        combined judgment of <gloss target="#t_SecGen1">SecGen</gloss> and Belgians,
                        and if he recommended Tour lease, U.S. would support him. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said he hoped to work out harmonious
                        conclusion with those most discontented. He did not want to spill blood. He
                        recognized U.S. desire to leave Paris.</p>
                    <p>6. Italian proposal for technological gap. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> explained he had prepared resolution which would
                        refer the problem to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Italians were
                        checking this with Germans and French. He hoped this would meet general
                        acceptance since his treatment would not prejudice division of future tasks
                        between NATO and other organizations.</p>

                    <p>9261. Secto 103. Personal for the President. The NATO meeting has gone well.
                        We may have a minor Donnybrook over the communique later today because of

                        without static from the Danes and Canadians who have in the past been

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s report on the international
                            situation, including Vietnam, was transmitted as an enclosure to

                            FR(PA))</note> and believe that we can get some additional assistance
                        from Germany, the Netherlands and some others but this must be developed
                        bilaterally in capitals. I hit George Brown pretty hard on the point that
                        they have the same treaty commitment that we have to “meet the common
                        danger” in Vietnam. I intend to press them very hard for more participation
                        but they will probably act like scared rabbits in the face of their domestic
                        political situation.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important developments here has been Willy Brandt's reaction
                        to non-proliferation. The present German Government is ready to forget
                        “hardware” and Brandt told me to forget the European clause. I am giving the
                        latest Russian text of Article One to the NATO members of the Geneva
                        Conference (UK, Canada and Italy) and will also show it privately to the
                        Germans. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> made a major
                        impression on NATO in demonstrating that the new German Government will not
                        be bound by the rigid theology of the <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> period and is prepared to probe the possibilities
                        of better relations with Eastern Europe, including the East Germans. This
                        may not move us forward but twenty years of hostile confrontation has not
                        done so and I believe that we should give them a chance to find out whether
                        another approach might produce more results.</p>
                    <p>I was glad to hear from Bob McNamara that you wanted to get as many of our
                        people and as much of our equipment out of France as possible prior to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s deadline. This seems
                        to me to be the dignified attitude which we should take in the face of an
                        outrageous decision taken without the slightest consultation with us.</p>
                    <p>I am trying to get details but the Norwegian Foreign Minister told me, with
                        some astonishment, that recent public opinion polls in Norway showed that
                        you were head and shoulders above any other world leader in the esteem of
                        the Norwegian people. This does not astonish me but he obviously was
                        surprised and pleased. I am also trying to get details of recent Japanese
                        polls showing that the US is way out in front of countries most respected
                        and admired by the Japanese people and that Peking has moved into first
                        place among their dislikes, now surpassing the Russians.</p>

                    <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> and spent 2–1/4 hours
                        with him. I told him that I had seen the President at his ranch in Texas and
                        that I had told him I would take the first opportunity after the government
                        had been formed, and it had had the opportunity to discuss the direction of
                        its foreign policy, to talk with the new German leaders. It had been
                        impossible or impractical to talk with him on the occasion of my last visit
                        to Germany while the new government was being formed. I told him I was now
                        in Germany for a short visit and I was glad to have this opportunity to
                        discuss with him his intentions regarding the direction of the new German
                        government's policy and to get his thoughts on how he viewed United States
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized that though I was still engaged in the tripartite discussions, I
                        was here now only as one who had a deep interest in the future of Germany
                        and its good relations with my own country; I expected to report to the
                        President my talks with him and with other German leaders but there would
                        not be the general diplomatic reporting of my visit. He said he was most
                        happy to have the chance to sit down and talk over the new direction of
                        things as far as it was now possible to do so.</p>
                    <p>I told him of my general instructions from the President on the tripartite
                        mission and I briefly outlined to him the basis on which I had been
                        appointed referring to the threat of British withdrawal of troops and the
                        need for a reappraisal of the NATO situation; its strategy; its force levels
                        and the sharing of burdens. We now had a brief respite before the
                        discussions resumed and I was taking advantage of my visit to Germany to
                        have from him, as best he could now give it, the direction of German policy
                        and what he hoped that the United States' direction would be in relation to
                        it. I added that I thought his recent statement of policy had been excellent
                        and that it had had a good reception in the State Department and generally
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0549"/>
                    <p>Since it had been frequently announced that the new government would endeavor
                        to make constructive advances in regard to France. I thought it well to
                        emphasize again that good relations between Germany and France were not only
                        consistent with United States policy but a matter of deep concern on the
                        part of the United States. Two world wars and tensions between Germany and
                        France had been the result of poor relations, the effect of which had been
                        to involve the United States in European affairs in a large way and we
                        rebelled at the idea propounded by French propaganda that we stood in the
                        way of good Franco-German relations. I said that the United States could
                        only be relieved and pleased if those relations were placed on a permanently
                        constructive basis. This had been a cardinal principle of our foreign policy
                        since the end of World War II. It was true in Schuman's time and it is true
                        in De Gaulle's as well. There was one thing we did wish to clarify however
                        and that was the attitude of Germany toward NATO. We could only read General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s intention as one of
                        distinct hostility to NATO. While we were not seeking to place ourselves
                        between France and Germany, we did believe we were entitled to know which
                        stood first in his mind, i.e., adherence to NATO or in the attempt to
                        improve relations with France, less emphasis on NATO and the principles on
                        which it was built. We had put a great deal of energy and resources into the
                        concept of collective security in Europe through NATO. It had been
                        successful and we believed it still had great validity; it was based on the
                        concept of equal partnership of all the participants, including Germany. If
                        the new German government was prepared to sacrifice the unity of NATO in
                        favor of a new relationship with France, we ought to know as it would affect
                        our whole position as a NATO partner. People were talking about new
                        directions of policy, more “modern” approaches to European security; less
                        adherence to the United States. Was there any suggestion in his own thinking
                        which involved any new relationships affecting Germany's position in
                        NATO?</p>
                    <p>He said he wanted to respond to this question very emphatically. The
                        coalition of which he was the leader representing over 2/3rds of all the
                        Bundestag votes adhered strictly to the concept of European collective
                        security which NATO represented—and more than 2/3rds of the country as a
                        whole took the same view. This was a basic principle. NATO had to be
                        developed, not retarded, in accordance with the requirements of the time. In
                        his recent statement he had said this. He had said no more about NATO in his
                        statement than this but this was not because of any lack of interest in NATO
                        but only because he did not want to burden his first statement with details
                        of military affairs and he wanted to emphasize in his first statement
                        Germany's great desire to get along well with all nations and not place too
                        much emphasis on Europe alone. He <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0550"/>wanted me to know and the President to know that the position of France in
                        respect to NATO had not the slightest effect on Germany's attitude to NATO.
                        He repeated this several times. He had been one of the strongest proponents
                        of the preamble to the French treaty which had stressed the priority of NATO
                        and he did not withdraw from the position in the slightest degree. What
                        concerned him was how to effect good relations with France at the same time
                        making perfectly clear his adherence to and dependence upon NATO. It
                        required some thought how best to proceed with these objectives in mind and
                        he was not at this moment clear as to what he could do to insure the
                        accomplishment of both objectives. He said he and all Germany urgently
                        desired to keep United States troops in Germany on the basis and in the
                        amount they were here now. If reduced he would be most unhappy and Germany
                        would have to think of an equivalent substitute because the threat from the
                        East had not disappeared. He had stressed in his statement that Germany had
                        in the past been overly preoccupied with its own problems and had not acted
                        as if it were aware of the problems of its allies. Germany was not now in a
                        position where it had to be solely occupied with its own problems. It was a
                        member of the Alliance and had to take into account the preoccupations of
                        its partners as well. The United States was beset with problems of which
                        Germany had to be aware and Germany had to be more understanding in respect
                        of them. Germany was no longer in the position of the young girl in love for
                        the first time who sought daily some new assurance from her lover of his
                        undying affection. Its task was to help create a real and dignified
                        partnership with the United States and not seek repeated assurances of
                        United States commitments as a member of the Alliance to the security of
                        Germany. “We take this for granted and intend to act accordingly,” was the
                        way he put it. He deplored the French defection and was sorry for it but we
                        had to put up with it, make the best of it and to look now for the practical
                        adjustments required by it and not merely deplore the past. It might be
                        presumptuous of him to hope that Germany might be of some help in trying to
                        bring about some better understanding with France on matters of military
                        security and between United States, NATO and France than had thus far been
                        practical, considering the French attitude. He did not have anything
                        specific in mind and it might only be wishful thinking on his part but he
                        intended to give the matter thought and try to accomplish something to
                        improve the arrangements with France in regard to defenses in case of
                        trouble and generally between France and the United States. He hoped there
                        was a role Germany could play along these lines. It was, at least, worth a
                        try.</p>
                    <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0551"/>
                    <p>The need was now to strengthen NATO. There was no justification either for
                        security reasons or for the inability to achieve the reunification of
                        Germany to suggest any withdrawal or weakening of NATO. It had not been the
                        objective of NATO, in the first place, to achieve reunification and he did
                        not share the view of some of his compatriots that NATO had been a failure
                        because reunification had not been achieved. NATO had been a resounding
                        success but it needed nourishment. There were some who once thought Germany
                        ought to withdraw from NATO in order to advance reunification; this was a
                        thing of the past, and no one in his right mind could think the Soviets
                        would be the more induced to grant reunification if NATO were to go or
                        Germany were to withdraw from it. He did feel that some relaxation of
                        tensions might help in the long struggle for reunification but he was under
                        no illusions respecting Soviet intentions in this respect. He was not
                        concerned over any detente with the United States and the Soviet Union. He
                        was in favor of it but one thing must be clear; the detente must not take
                        the form of cementing or acquiescing in the status quo. Germany did look
                        toward eventual reunification; it would not be a self-respecting nation if
                        it did not constantly seek to bring it about. There was no possibility of
                        any acceptable Soviet proposal for reunification coming about in the
                        reasonable future. There were some fears that a detente with the Soviet
                        Union on the part of the United States would embody an acceptance of the
                        status quo. This was not his worry as he was aware that the United States
                        had been the first to declare for the reunification of Germany and had been
                        the most steadfast adherent of it. He was less confident of France.</p>

                        to NATO.]</p>
                    <p>As for NATO, the 14 met without France and proved they could do a substantial
                        amount of business.</p>
                    <p>The Permanent Nuclear Committee was set up after a year and half of work. The
                        task was to drive it forward fast. He discussed with both <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> how this must be done. It is important work. This
                        will reduce the German pressure for a hardware solution to their nuclear
                        role. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said the hardware issue
                        could be set aside; but there was disagreement in the German government.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> also believes the Germans
                        will not stand in the way of non-proliferation agreement; although there
                        will be dissension within the German government.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office will suffer greatly from <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> movement to the Ministry of Defense with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>—<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> being the “best European diplomat we deal
                        with.”</p>
                    <p>On the offset issue, there was considerable evidence that the Germans would
                        find it difficult to offset fully. He didn't discuss the shortrun issue but
                        did talk with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> on the
                        long-run issues—after June 30, 1967. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> was depressed about both the future size of the
                        defense budget and the problem of offsetting by other means U.K. and U.S.
                        expenditures in Germany. The U.K. insisted that it would act on or before
                        June 30 unless its foreign exchange expenditures in Germany were fully
                        offset.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the Nuclear Committee, a second constructive development was the
                        agreement to proceed with realistic force planning looking ahead 5 years.
                        The finance and military authorities will work together to achieve that
                        realism.</p>

                    <p>The Belgian proposal for complete review of the future of NATO was accepted.
                        It was not clear, however, whether this would include military as well as
                        non-military matters. The U.S. preferred that it confine itself to the
                        non-military aspects of NATO. It was also not clear what the fate would be
                        of the idea of Europeans joining together to achieve a consensus within NATO

                        delegation reporting is necessarily so voluminous that it has strained the
                        attention span of most of our addressees. It may therefore be useful to
                        summarize what we think happened here this week.</p>
                    <p>1. The Fourteen, glued together now in a formal way as a Council level
                        Defense Planning Committee (<gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>), went ahead
                        in a business-like way to make a series of important decisions about NATO
                        defense system. Specifically:</p>
                    <p>A. They established the Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee (<gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>) and its seven member Nuclear Planning
                        Group. (The New York Times locally is unhappy because they used a Paris
                        dateline to predict a six-member committee though we told them to be
                        cautious.) Since the Germans at <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s level are relaxed about “hardware” and even the <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0554"/>much debated “European clause” in
                        nuclear defense affairs, this means that for the time being at least we can
                        stop debating how to cut the allies in on nuclear matters, and proceed
                        systematically to do so.</p>
                    <p>B. They laid the doctrinal basis for a system of communications and data
                        exchange that could make a great deal of difference in meaningful
                        consultation among governments in time of diplomatic or military crisis.</p>
                    <p>C. They agreed (subject still to a Portuguese reservation which is not
                        crucial) to common funding of future exercises by the <gloss target="#t_ACE1">ACE</gloss> mobile force.</p>
                    <p>D. They approved, on schedule, the first stage of a NATO communications
                        satellite program—an R&amp;D link between <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>'s new headquarters and AFSOUTH in Naples.</p>
                    <p>2. The Fourteen got back to the subject of strategy, which has been taboo in
                        NATO since the mid-1950's because France was not willing to abandon formally
                        the doctrine of instant massive retaliation. Now, the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>, Military Committee, and NATO commanders,
                        newly and fruitfully related to each other, are engaged in a fundamental new
                        look at NATO strategy as related to forces and budgets. As a result of
                        trilateral, NPG and <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> “studies” (in this
                        business, the word “studies” is a euphemism for inter-governmental
                        negotiations about strategy and military policy), we should be able to
                        develop during 1967 a thorough-going revision of the concepts for NATO
                        military and force planning, and base on them NATO's first real five-year
                        plan. There will be many disagreements, and on some points we may never
                        achieve unanimous consent even without France. But a great deal of fresh air
                        has been let into NATO through the force planning exercise, and it was
                        blowing freely here this week.</p>
                    <p>(The chief uncertainty in NATO defense plans is still the United States of
                        America. The decisions we make about our own forces, and the time scale in
                        which they are carried out, will make or break the NATO defense system.
                        Decisions by others, notably the British and the Germans, are also important
                        in themselves, but their greatest significance lies in the way they affect
                        US domestic support for our NATO commitment.)</p>
                    <p>3. The NATO-France issues were not front and center in this conference. On
                        the defense side, of course, the group of Fourteen was in unembarrassed
                        charge of the proceedings. The “boundary line” between France and NATO has
                        been largely drawn, and never even needed to be discussed by Ministers.</p>
                    <p>It seemed earlier that we might find the French defecting to some extent from
                        the political side of NATO using the discussion of East/West relations as
                        the proximity fuse. But, French apparently decided that it did not serve
                        their interest to pick a fight on the basic issues—which are whether NATO
                        has a role to play in working toward East/West detente <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>and whether NATO members of the Alliance
                        should try to develop a common line to guide their pluralistic approaches to
                        the Eastern Europeans. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName> did not press the objection that had been made at
                        lower levels to the report by the Permanent Council on East/West
                            Relations<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">A copy of this report is ibid.,
                            Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF 115.</note> (which clearly projects a
                        NATO role). He also did not interfere with, and indeed agreed to, the
                        Belgian proposal for studying the future tasks of an Alliance that clearly
                        proposes to be in business after the magic 20-year deadline of 1969. The
                        French also raised no problems about NATO picking up for action the Italian
                        initiative about technological cooperation.</p>
                    <p>In short, the French delegation clearly had instructions not to recreate on
                        the political side the French-NATO split which is already a fact of life,
                        expressed in institutional arrangements, on the defense side of Alliance
                        affairs. An indication of resulting atmosphere was sardonic question by de
                        la Grandville when the communique committee was discussing the Belgian
                        initiative. He called attention to the provision in Belgian resolution that
                        Europeans should consult with each other within the framework of the
                        Alliance, and asked with a show of virtuous incredulity “does that mean we
                        are going to consult about these matters without the presence of our
                        American friends?”</p>
                    <p>4. It should be possible to make something important and interesting out of
                        this Belgium initiative. We have insisted here that this is not “just
                        another study,” but that it can become a serious effort by governments, with
                        the participation of responsible political executives from capitals, to
                        reformulate our collective aims in a way that fits the increasing fluid
                        international situation, and is more likely to appeal to the generation that
                        does not remember why we got into an Atlantic Alliance to begin with.</p>
                    <p>5. There can also, in our view, be considerable nourishment in a North
                        Atlantic Council process on technological cooperation which takes both an
                        internal look at what NATO itself can do, and an external look at whether
                        the diverse bilateral arrangements and international organs which supposedly
                        cover this field are concentrating on what most needs to be done to get
                        results. In particular, the drive for more and better technology in Europe
                        can perhaps be channeled into more support for a (wider) Common Market in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>6. The reaction to our continuing stress on the responsibilities of NATO
                        countries outside the NATO area was distinct change from a year ago. Then,
                        the idea that Europeans should worry about world order (by which they
                        thought we meant Viet-Nam) was actively resisted, in private conversation if
                        not formal statements. Today, the Europeans are less <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0556"/>excited about the Viet-Nam war, more
                        impressed by the fact that it does not seem to be inhibiting all forms of
                        US–USSR cooperation (outer space treaty, non-proliferation), generally
                        certain that American power is committed and that Hanoi cannot win, and less
                        convinced that the war is bound to escalate into a general
                        conflagration.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Chinese Communist behavior in the past year has reduced current
                        support for detente with China, and increased longer term worries about
                        Chinese capacities and intentions. We may be several years from the time
                        when the major European countries will be willing to invest time, effort,
                        and money in post-colonial external policies. But a sluggish trend away from
                        the post-war pattern of regional isolationism is already visible to the
                        naked eye in the politics of most European countries. By-product and
                        evidence of this trend was the almost total absence in this NATO meeting of
                        official criticism of the US role in Viet-Nam—except, of course, by the
                        Foreign Minister of France.</p>
                    <p>7. There was a brief flurry about <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        relocation when the Germans (with more or less Canadian, Danish, Norwegian
                        and Portuguese support) suggested <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> remain
                        in Paris until a permanent building could be built in Brussels. But they
                        added the proviso that next year's December Council session should be held
                        in Brussels. When the Germans put this to the French, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> was welcome to stay in Paris but could not then treat Paris
                        as a forbidden place for NATO Ministers to meet. The stay-in-Paris movement
                        thereupon collapsed, and permanent and provisional sites were readily
                        agreed. If we can avoid forming too many committees on the subject, <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should move to Brussels by the end of next
                        year.</p>
                    <p>8. All in all, this meeting produced more action, less conflict, and a more
                        definite pattern for the future than even NATO's well wishers had assumed.
                        The balance of benefits and disabilities which may be produced by combining
                        a more cautious France, a more robust Germany, an impecunious Britain, a
                        less obstreperous Denmark, and a Greece and Turkey seriously seeking a basic
                        accommodation, cannot yet be predicted. But through basic collective
                        process, in the Fourteen on defense and the Fifteen on detente, we will
                        learn much about the opportunities, and will have to be in a position to
                        take advantage of them in carrying out the mandate in the President's
                        October 7 speech.</p>
                    <p>That mandate is for continuing US interest and activity in Atlantic, and
                        therefore in European, affairs. There is always an inherent danger our
                        leadership will show too much, though on this score the recent NATO
                        Ministerial Session was outstanding: so many of our ideas were blended with
                        those of other nations in the advance preparations and this week's corridor
                        consultations, that nobody was heard to complain about US “lecturing”,
                        nobody objected to the trilateral talks, and the word “<pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0557"/>hegemony” was not even used by press
                        spokesmen in those semi-public gripe sessions called “backgrounders”.</p>
                    <p>In any case, our impression is that most thoughtful Europeans are worrying
                        less about the continuity of US leadership than about its discontinuance due
                        to US domestic pressures. The best way to deal with this nameless fear seems
                        to be to advise our European friends to read the President's October 7
                        speech again, and to note the evidence, in Viet-Nam and elsewhere, that the
                        USA means what the President says.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> referred to the
                        widespread impression that the US no longer actively supports European
                        unification. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> described our
                        policy as essentially unchanged. Our capacity to influence events in Europe,
                        however, has perhaps waned somewhat, and it is hard to know what can
                        effectively be done. There continue also to be many complicating factors,
                        for example confusion about UK and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        desires and policy. We consider it necessary for the Europeans to get
                        together. The Ambassador said the Dutch are in a dilemma, having opposed the
                        Fouchet Plan in the past. Should they now be persuaded that half of a loaf
                        is better then none? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said
                        that in hindsight it might perhaps have been wise to have agreed to the
                        Fouchet Plan originally. The Ambassador noted that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is now a more effective counter-weight to
                        France and the UK might enter the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> alluded to various <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0558"/>European charges that the US seeks
                        to dominate Europe. Understandably, we are sensitive to such charges and may
                        thus appear to some to show less interest in Europe, while this in fact is
                        not the case. For us to deal with problems in many fields, e.g. the
                        so-called technological gap, a coherent and active European entity is
                        essential. The Ambassador commented that the Netherlands does not fear US
                        domination. Rather it hopes to avoid a Europe united under a potentially
                        aggressive France, hence Dutch support for UK entry into the Six and close
                        ties with the US.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador hoped UK entry would prove possible and said the Five should
                        bend every effort to make it hard for France to say no. The UK could help by
                        reiterating acceptance of the ground rules and not overstressing their
                        “special relationship” with the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> commented that this relationship has always inspired a
                        certain mystique and perhaps the British have stressed it for lack of an
                        alternate policy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SCWA1">Schurmann</persName> noted that the declining UK role in the Far East
                        and the essentially pragmatic personalities of the present US and UK leaders
                        combined to dilute this relationship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> added that as a practical matter the UK would be wise
                        to turn an ability to talk to us into a European asset, providing itself a
                        greater role in a unified Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> explained that the
                        trilateral talks are suspended while the new German Government arrives at a
                        position, perhaps in three or four weeks. The Ambassador asked about Senator
                        Mansfield's views on Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said he expected the Senator to continue to push his
                        viewpoint, which reflects many not necessarily congruent attitudes of
                        discontent concerning our European policy.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Britain and the Common Market</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the signs from Paris were that the
                        French might judge whether the U.K. was sufficiently “European” for
                        membership of the Common Market by the extent to which the U.K. was willing
                        to be anti-American, particularly on international monetary questions. He
                        wished to make it clear that in order to get into the Common Market we were
                        not willing to line up with France alone on these matters. The Prime
                        Minister might talk in Paris about such things as the possibility of a
                        common European currency however; and there was a danger that what he had
                        said might be misrepresented in the French press as meaning that he had
                        accepted the General's point of view on various matters. He asked Mr.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> not to believe all
                        he might hear from Paris about this.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor's own view was that the odds were against success in the
                        British effort to gain entry into the Common Market. Some work was being
                        done in London, on a purely hypothetical basis, on the possibility of an
                        Atlantic free trade area as an alternative and he wondered whether at some
                        stage it might be useful for the two Treasuries to carry out a joint factual
                        study of this question. It would, of course, be important to keep this
                        secret.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> expressed the view that in the event
                        of a deterioration in the prospects for eventual entry, this subject was
                        bound to receive attention in Washington. But they thought the time <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0560"/>was perhaps not yet ripe. In any
                        case, there was always the risk of a leak in Washington if an Anglo American
                        study were undertaken and this could be very damaging when the U.K. was
                        still directing its main effort into gaining membership of the E.E.C. The
                        outcome of the Kennedy Round discussions later this year would also have
                        important bearing on the question. More generally, if the present U.K.
                        negotiations with the Common Market was unsuccessful there might be
                        advantages in not seeking to define the alternative courses of action too
                        sharply at any rate for some time. The U.K. might think it better to adopt a
                        policy of waiting it out, in order eventually to obtain the objective of
                        entry in the E.E.C.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledged that this might be a possible
                        policy, but pointed out that it would be psychologically difficult and
                        perhaps damaging to confidence in the prospects for the economy. He thought
                        there might be advantage at that stage in having some alternative under
                        examination.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that this subject could be discussed further, informally,
                        during the Chancellor's visit to Washington in February.</p>

                    <p>On NATO, the Secretary said that we feel reassured by the solidarity of the
                        Fourteen in moving forward with integrated forces. Our own 200,000 troops on
                        the central front are fully integrated and we have been thankful for the
                        solidarity of the Fourteen in moving toward integration. We attach great
                        importance to developing a common view on the nature of the threat, what we
                        should do about the threat, and an equitable and reasonable sharing of the
                        burden. We would be most concerned over the chain reaction from unilateral
                        actions such as rumored reductions by the UK, Luxembourg, and Belgium. This
                        would have an adverse effect on our own ability to meet NATO requirements;
                        it would add to the feeling over here that Europe bases its own action on
                        detente, but wants us to base our action on confrontation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> referred to newspaper
                        headlines which could give the false impression that Viet-Nam pre-occupies
                        us to the exclusion of everything else. The Secretary said that he had spent
                        his first two years in office as a “Berlin expert”, with the possibility of
                        war with the Soviet Union always present during that period as a result of
                        Berlin and the Cuba missile problems. The Secretary said that we are, as a
                        Government, much occupied with NATO, East-West relations, and other major
                        European problems. The President spends more time on these problems than on
                        the relatively straight-forward problem in Viet-Nam. The Secretary said that
                        we had needed advice from our friends on things we should be doing in
                        Europe, and said that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                        would feel free at anytime to offer us advice.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> reminded the Secretary that
                        during a recent television interview for the American Broadcasting
                        Corporation, he had been asked what he intended to take up with us in
                        Washington; and that he had replied that one thing he did not want to do was
                        to act like a girl who constantly has to be reassured by her boyfriend that
                        he still loves her.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that on NATO the Federal
                        Republic is in favor of going on with integrated forces. He said that on the
                        British problem, the Germans will have to see what they could do to
                        contribute to a solution; the Germans want British troops to remain both for
                        military and political reasons.</p>

                        point of departure latest Belgian paper (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>). Exchange of views brought out considerable common
                        ground between ourselves and the Belgians re (a) desirable next steps in
                        NATO and (b) overall goals for the study. Specific subjects covered
                        were:</p>
                    <p>4. Confirmation that NATO countries will remain in Alliance after 1969. We
                        agreed with Belgium's objective in seeking political recommitment to
                        Alliance. We thought it important nevertheless to avoid raising questions of
                        new commitments for fixed period of years or any actions requiring
                        parliamentary ratification. US side considered more useful approach would be
                        to have the study document the continuing long-range need for NATO in terms
                        of purposes (e.g. achieving and maintaining East-West settlement).</p>
                    <p>5. Belgians showed much interest in this approach. They maintained however
                        that some clear declaration is required at end of the study to strengthen
                        hand of Alliance supporters in Belgium and other countries as 1969
                        approaches. Both sides recognized this point need not be raised for action
                        at present stage although <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        plans to refer to it in his remarks at <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.
                        Rostow made clear U.S. receptivity to appropriate declaration at end of
                        study.</p>
                    <p>6. Procedure for the study. Belgians outlined their two-stage proposal
                        envisaging broadly: (a) study on improvement of Permanent <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0563"/>Council's work methods between now and
                        June; (b) factual examination of international situation as it relates to
                        the Alliance, also to be ready for June Ministerial meeting, and (c)
                        establishment in June of open-ended group of governmental representatives.
                        Latter would do main substantive work of defining future Alliance tasks and
                        preparing political report for Ministerial action next December.</p>
                    <p>7. Davignon and de Staercke emphasized that, while Belgian approach partly
                        motivated by practical considerations, chief concern is tactical. They wish
                        to avoid frightening off any hesitant governments by introducing
                        politically-charged questions in first stage. They are also anxious to give
                        French as small a target as possible until the exercise is well under
                        way.</p>
                    <p>8. Belgians would however seek to have factual examination shaped so that
                        main political issues of concern to Alliance members would emerge logically.
                        This they believe would make it more difficult for NATO members to refuse to
                        go along with examination of policy issues in second or substantive
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>9. While recognizing advantages in Belgian approach, we queried whether it is
                        necessary or even desirable to await June Ministerial to establish
                        substantive group. Rostow stressed importance of taking last December's
                        Ministerial resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">For text, see American
                            Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1966, p.
                            379.</note> as firm decision committing governments to participate. He
                        saw potential danger in requiring new Ministerial action in June to set up
                        second group after factual examination is concluded.</p>
                    <p>10. Conclusion was that we might use February 15 meeting to try for earliest
                        possible <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> action embracing following
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>A. Decision to implement December resolution by establishing open-ended group
                        under Brosio's chairmanship with flexible procedures. Membership would be at
                        level each government decided. (We would urge periodic high-level
                        participation from capitals for at least the key countries.)</p>
                    <p>B. Group would be charged with preparing factual examination of the
                        international situation as it affects the Alliance for interim report to
                        Ministers in June. Same body would then proceed with policy exercise to
                        define tasks of the Alliance and procedures for carrying them out for next
                        December's Ministerial with no break in continuity; i.e., one <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> decision now would take care of both stages
                        in Belgian proposal.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> would ask <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> to commission an independent management study on
                        means to improve the organization's operations. Permanent Representatives
                        would participate in this exercise.</p>
                    <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0564"/>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">European Caucus</hi>. Belgians made clear they are
                        still much interested in some system for consultations among European NATO
                        members. They have decided to soft-pedal matter for the present, however,
                        hoping arrangement will emerge naturally in course of the study. Rostow made
                        clear that US remains sympathetic to aim of Europeans consulting together in
                        Alliance framework.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Content of Study</hi>. Both sides considered it
                        important soon to begin quiet exploration of political topics that might be
                        considered in study's second phase. We mentioned various examples of
                        questions involving Alliance members directly (e.g. European security
                        problems) and issues outside Treaty area (e.g. Middle East arms and security
                        aspects of the food crisis in Asia). Belgians several times mentioned China
                        as illustration of problem external to NATO but which clearly concerns
                        Europeans via impact on USSR.</p>
                    <p>13. As to method, Belgians like ourselves thought NATO might profit from
                        McNamara Committee's experience. Instead of abstract study of procedures for
                        improving political consultation, we would aim at series of “model” or
                        “practice” consultations. These substantive exercises, useful in themselves,
                        would give basis for general recommendations at end of the study.</p>
                    <p>14. In addition to improving consultation arrangements, US and Belgian
                        participants agreed study might also embrace such other issues as
                        strengthening NATO Parliamentarians and improving NATO information
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>15. Summary of <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s paper (Paris

                    <p>At the meeting tomorrow you might open by asking <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                        summarize for you the three alternatives:</p>
                    <p>1. No cut (<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s preference);</p>
                    <p>2. Rotation of 1 division and 3 air wings (<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s recommendation);</p>
                    <p>3. Rotation of 2 divisions and 6 air wings (<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recommendation).</p>
                    <p>You might then want to ask for comment from both <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        with respect to consequences for:</p>
                    <p>1. military security;</p>
                    <p>2. possible troop reduction bargain with the Russians;</p>
                    <p>3. alliance politics and our relations with the Germans;</p>
                    <p>4. balance of payments and international money;</p>
                    <p>5. the UK-German problem.</p>
                    <p>My memorandum at Tab I has a section on each of these, as well as a section
                        on the domestic political consequences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">At the end of the meeting</hi>, you may or may not want to
                        give us a decision, especially since you will have had so little time to
                        study the papers.</p>
                    <p>If you decide in favor of no cut or a cut of 1 division (<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>), you may want to have a further talk
                        alone with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. If you decide
                        for a 2-division cut, you may want to do the same with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. In either case, it will be important
                        for <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to bring <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> over for a private session with you
                        before your decision is absolutely final. This is important whether or not
                        we want <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to continue as the
                        U.S. negotiator. (As you know, he is ready to carry on if you decide on a
                        1-division cut. If you decide in favor of cutting 2, I believe he will want
                        quietly to withdraw. If we manage that gently, I do not think his possible
                        withdrawal should be a serious consideration in your decision.)</p>
                    <p>I am sorry my Tab I memo is on the longish side. (I also apologize for the

                        agreed on until early evening.) However, I believe this decision will cast a
                        very long shadow on our relations with Germany and Europe, with consequences
                        for domestic politics. It is a tough apples-or-<pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0566"/>oranges Presidential decision, on which your advisors can

                    <p>I have now had the benefit of the views and advice of Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>.
                        I much appreciate your readiness to continue our discussions with the United
                        Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany in the forthcoming Trilateral
                        talks and ask that you conduct these talks in accordance with the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>1. Our general approach to the Trilateral negotiations involves three
                        interrelated factors:</p>
                    <p>—Force levels should be determined through agreement among the Allies on the
                        basis only of security considerations, broadly construed;</p>
                    <p>—Germany should decide what levels of procurement in the U.S. and Britain it
                        wishes to undertake in order to bring its military forces up to appropriate
                        strength levels;</p>
                    <p>—Simultaneously, the Allies should deal with the remaining balance of
                        payments consequences of allied troops stationed in Germany by cooperation
                        in the management of monetary reserves or by other agreed means.</p>
                    <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0567"/>
                    <p>2. It is important for me to know</p>
                    <p>(i) the results of further consultations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, the UK, and our other NATO partners on the security issues
                        involved;</p>
                    <p>(ii) UK plans for troop reductions or redeployment and the plans of other
                        NATO governments;</p>
                    <p>(iii) the proposals of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with respect
                        to balance of payments neutralization and reserve-management
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>It is my view that any agreements on force levels reached in the Trilateral
                        discussions are to be considered and confirmed in NATO, to assure that the
                        decisions will have broad Allied support.</p>
                    <p>3. Further, in order to make clear to the German government that the
                        financial negotiations with the Bundesbank touch on matters of the greatest
                        political and economic concern to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                        you should tell the Germans at a high political level that:</p>
                    <p>(i) The President is determined not to jeopardize the security of the
                        Alliance. The NATO nations cannot afford to sacrifice basic security for
                        financial reasons.</p>
                    <p>(ii) We are seeking an understanding that, just as security is a common
                        problem which can only be solved by cooperation so are the monetary
                        difficulties created by security efforts a common problem which can only be
                        solved by cooperation. Allies should be willing to cooperate in both
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>(iii) In the absence of a financial solution, and especially in the light of
                        the large German payments surplus, Congressional and public pressure would
                        be intense, and the Germans should recognize that the situation might get
                        out of hand.</p>
                    <p>4. Because we want to avoid a drastic cut in the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>, I request that you assist us in preparing for my review a
                        discussion of the options open to us for breaking the UK-German deadlock on
                        money in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of such a cut.</p>
                    <p>I know that you will keep me and the Secretary of State informed on the
                        course of your discussions and I can assure you that we will try to respond
                        promptly to questions requiring decisions as the talks proceed.</p>
                    <p>We are grateful for this additional public service on your part.<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4">These instructions were the subject of a meeting with

                    <p>The meeting had been requested with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> to enable Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to report on the results of the trilateral meeting

                            7113 and 7117 from London, March 3 and 4, respectively. (Ibid.)</note>
                        The meeting was held in the guest house of Dr. Scheufeln in Stuttgart.</p>
                    <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> advised the Chancellor
                        that he had before the trilateral meeting met twice with the President in
                        Washington. One of these meetings included the leaders of the Congress.<note n="4" xml:id="d239fn4">No record of this meeting has been found.</note>
                        During these meetings, the question of US force levels in Europe had been
                        fully discussed.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that he first
                        wished to make reference to the Chancellor's press conference with <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>
                        publishers held on February 27. The original version of the conference, as
                        received in Washington, had created a strong reaction. The President himself
                        had been concerned at the reported remark about “complicity” between the US
                        and USSR in putting forward the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                        Difficulties are created when heads of government appear to be critical of
                        each other. The President resented the implication that we had gone behind
                        the backs of our allies or that we were attempting to substitute a US-Soviet
                        understanding for NATO. We were doing our best to help NATO recover from the
                        French blow. We are against massive withdrawals of troops from NATO and are
                        doing all we can to hold the line on force levels.</p>
                    <p>3. In the meantime, there are strong domestic pressures particularly in
                        Congress, for large-scale US troop reductions. Although these stem from a
                        variety of motives, there is the feeling that Europe is not bearing its fair
                        share of the burden. The President wanted him to advise <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">
                            <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0569"/>Kiesinger</persName> that he
                        wanted something as a base from which to fight to maintain the US position
                        in Europe and would do so, provided he had some room to maneuver. If others
                        will do something, we will not be found lagging behind. The President had
                        recounted the substantial forces that the US had committed to the defense of
                        Europe. He was determined that we should not endanger the future of NATO.
                        Various of the Allies seemed to be “trampling each other” in being the first
                        to withdraw forces. The President had asked him to assure the Chancellor
                        that in his view decisions with respect to force levels should be made on a
                        multilateral basis, involving NATO as a whole. They should not be determined
                        by the financial and budgetary problems of individual countries, but rather
                        on the basis of security. The President needed reinforcement for his
                        position.</p>
                    <p>4. The President hoped that the Chancellor would understand his problems,
                        just as he tried to understand Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s and the Chancellor's problems. Public disputes
                        between the three are not helpful. The President thought his conversation
                        with FonMin Brandt,<note n="5" xml:id="d239fn5">No record of this meeting
                            has been found.</note> during the latter's recent visit to Washington,
                        had revealed a desire to reach common positions and policies in a
                        constructive way. The President had pointed out that there had been many
                        consultations with the Germans in recent months, perhaps more than with
                        representatives of any other country.</p>
                    <p>5. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> interjected to
                        say that it had not been his intention in the press conference in question
                        to criticize the US Govt. He said that we, and he had stressed the “we” to
                        make it clear that he meant both the US and Germany, have in recent times
                        been mainly discussing matters in dispute between us. When he mentioned the
                        word “complicity,” in describing the origins of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, he had done so smilingly. He, moreover, immediately
                        shifted to the words “common responsibilities”. It was understandable, in
                        the light of their special nuclear responsibilities, that it is the US and
                        the Soviets who must initiate such a treaty. He believed that consultations
                        might have been started earlier; however, it was partly the fault of the
                        Germans. The German Cabinet had known that an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was pending but had failed to raise the question with the
                        US.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> replied that, although he
                        had not come to Germany to discuss the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        with the Chancellor, he was, of course, deeply interested in it. He reminded
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> that he is a member of
                        the President's Disarmament Advisory Committee. The fact is that the US and
                        the Soviet Union had been discussing an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        for many years. There was, however, little for the US to raise with its
                        allies until we had some evidence that there was a possible breakthrough
                        with the Soviets. He himself had always pointed out that the US must consult
                        with the Germans at the <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0570"/>very first
                        opportunity, in view of the importance that an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would have for Germany. Perhaps both sides had been at
                        fault. However, he particularly deplored such emotional statements as that
                        reportedly made by <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> to the
                        effect that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was the Morgenthau Plan
                        squared. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> interjected to say
                        that he strongly disapproved of the <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> statement and had told him so.</p>
                    <p>7. In returning to the discussion in the trilateral committee on force
                        levels, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said he had told
                        the committee that he considered that the West was in a critical situation.
                        We must stop derogating NATO. We must do something positive to reaffirm our
                        faith in NATO. In his private discussions with British Representative
                        Thomson and German Representative <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>, he had outlined the options open to President
                        Johnson. The President is seeking a basis for a decision on force levels.
                        British PriMin <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> had told
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> that if the financial
                        side could be covered, he would not reduce British forces at all. It is not
                        possible, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said, to
                        separate the question of US and UK force levels. A massive withdrawal by the
                        UK would have an important bearing on the ability of the US to maintain its
                        troop level. Perhaps all involved could give a little to the end that there
                        would be no withdrawals or such insignificant withdrawals that it could be
                        taken as a renewal of faith in NATO.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> how many forces they would withdraw
                        if the Germans paid no offset, to which <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> had replied that the withdrawal would be massive,
                        over half. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> had then asked
                        him what the British would do if the Germans renewed their Petersberg offset
                        offer; would they limit their withdrawals to a brigade? This <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> said he could not agree to. There
                        would be too large a gap. They would be forced to withdraw more.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had assured <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> that the US was prepared to move from its previous
                        rather tough position on arms sales during the Erhard era. The Germans can
                        in the future buy arms wherever they like, although we assume that they will
                        still need some US arms and would like to know the general level of these
                        needs. The rest of our foreign exchange losses, resulting from our troops in
                        Germany, we hope to have neutralized through financial transactions with the
                        Bundesbank. <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> had pressed
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> for some indication as
                        to what the Germans would be willing to do, however <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> had insisted that there would be
                        no decision until the German Cabinet meeting on March 15.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that he had interpreted
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> to imply that the
                        Germans could accept the removal of one of the six British brigades.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> made it clear that the
                        British problem was only a financial one, and that he hoped it would be
                        necessary to remove no more than a brigade.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> said that there was little
                        the British could accept in terms of financial neutralization. Their
                        short-term indebtedness was too <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0571"/>great. They might, however, be able to offset a portion of their foreign
                        exchange costs in this way. He asked <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> why the US could not let Germany spend some of their
                        US credits for arms purchases in the UK. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had replied that he did not consider this possible,
                        because German advances had already been incorporated into the US balance of
                        payments and allocated against necessary procurement plans.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that the US would
                        like to know what the Germans can do, both with respect to the US and UK
                        offset payments. The US is in a difficult position, because the UK had
                        accused us of delaying the resolution of this problem by our proposal for
                        the trilateral talks. He knew of the independent position of the Bundesbank,
                        but he hoped that the Chancellor would use such influence as he has to
                        assure that the Bundesbank cooperated in some type of financial
                        neutralization of our foreign exchange losses. The UK can not hold the line
                        much longer. The US President is under great pressure from the Congress,
                        however, he can hold the line if given some significant support from our
                        allies in Europe. He hoped that progress could be made in the next
                        trilateral meeting scheduled for March 20. In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that the President has asked
                        him to tell the Chancellor that he should not hesitate to take up with him
                        directly, any matter arising out of our relations that troubles him.</p>
                    <p>12. In response, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> said his
                        experts had advised him that the British were determined to reduce
                        “massively” in any case. This impression had been confirmed to some degree
                        by the statements made by <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        during his Bonn visit when he referred to the necessity of a “surgical
                        operation,” after which he trusted there would be no hard feelings. The
                        British White Paper on defense had also seemed to point to this. Moreover,
                        they had been hearing US rumors to the effect that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was bent on reducing forces
                        substantially and there was always the threat of the Mansfield
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>13. This was one aspect of the situation. Another was the fact that German
                        finances were in a “miserable mess”. The Minister of Defense had told him
                        that there was really very little of value to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the way of military equipment which the UK had or could
                        readily produce. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had in October
                        suggested the Petersberg compromise of some 350 million DM, plus some
                        possible additional amounts. The new government had, however, found there
                        was no money—Strauss insisting that there was none at his disposal. The
                        combination of all these factors presented great difficulties. He hoped that
                        decisions could be made at the Cabinet meeting scheduled for the middle of
                        March. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> said that the
                        position <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had taken in London
                        had been very helpful, and that he would “try to find a way”.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> then said that he hoped
                        the President would understand how his use of the term “complicity” had been
                        completely misinterpreted. <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0572"/>He
                        referred to the attempts he had made to correct the misimpression that the
                        first reports of his talk had made. Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> intervened to say that he had cabled to Washington,
                        pointing out the series of steps the Chancellor had taken to put the proper
                        interpretation on his statement. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> said he fully understood and applauded the
                        objective of reducing tensions on the East-West issue</p>
                    <p>15. The furthest thing from his mind had been to suggest that the US had any
                        ill purpose in relation to Germany in seeking a non-proliferation agreement.
                        There were a number of motivations behind the proposed agreement. From the
                        point of view of the US, he was certain the purpose was to avoid atomic war
                        and the dangers inherent in the indiscriminate proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons. He recognized the “special relationship between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union which their responsibilities as the world's greatest
                        nuclear powers imposed upon them”, yet he was quite certain that the Soviet
                        Union had other motivations than those of the US. Fundamentally, the Soviet
                        Union wished to keep Germany down, and he felt that the purpose of the
                        agreement was directed primarily against Germany.</p>
                    <p>16. He wished that <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, when in
                        Washington, could have discussed with the American authorities the real
                        motives and rationale of the US in regard to the agreement, particularly in
                        the light of Soviet motivations. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had not developed this concern of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> felt it would have been much
                        better if this fundamental question of policy could have been discussed and
                        weighed before the matter had been taken up with the Soviets. The matter
                        involved fundamental policy of vital concern to Germany, and he would have
                        wished that the reasoning behind the agreement and our putting it forward at
                        this particular time with an expression of the need for haste could have
                        been better explained. There was a real international policy issue involved.
                        He did not, however, place the full blame on the US for the manner in which
                        the question had been raised. Everyone knew that a desire to reach a
                        non-proliferation agreement was prevalent, and there had been indications
                        that approaches were probably being made by the US to the Soviet Union. This
                        should have been enough to prompt the Erhard govt to raise the matter at an
                        early date with the US Govt, instead it had been allowed to come to a head
                        at a particularly unfortunate time. Kiesinger thought that, in this respect,
                        both of us were to blame. The matter had been blown up into a real political
                        issue in Germany. Even such a devoted pro-American as Birrenbach had been
                        greatly disturbed about it. If it had been handled differently, public
                        opinion could have been better prepared and a better understanding of the
                        motivation of the US could have been achieved.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> emphasized his deep
                        concern for the welfare of the Alliance. “I want to strengthen NATO.” In
                        response to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s efforts <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0573"/>to induce him to take steps to
                        weaken NATO, he had told him very clearly that it was firm German policy to
                        maintain and strengthen NATO. He had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> that he must understand this. There was a rising
                        feeling, however, in Germany, that something had “gone wrong” with the
                        former pattern of good relations between the US and Germany. This was
                        accompanied by a feeling that NATO was in danger of developing into a sort
                        of “shell with no real spirit left in it.” There were elements in the NPD
                        Party attempting to exploit an anti-American feeling. This was an utterly
                        new development in German politics in the postwar period. He did not believe
                        the move would succeed and did not attach too great importance to it, but
                        for the first time in the history of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        there had been a public outcry against a proposal put forward by our US
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>18. There had been some indication that the NPD had been losing ground in
                        Hesse and Bavaria since the elections, but he could not say that in future
                        elections the NPD might not have some measure of success. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had done harm to US-German
                        relations by his likening the non-proliferation agreement to the Morgenthau
                        Plan squared, as had van de Gruben by likening it to Versailles. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> had received a letter from
                        Adenauer complaining about the agreement, to which he had replied very
                        strongly. Yet there was no doubt that some damage had been done. The
                        non-proliferation situation, coming on top of the question of offsets and
                        the fall of Erhard after his unfortunate Washington visit, had constituted
                        the last drop which made the barrel overflow, at a particularly difficult
                        period in the life of the new government.</p>
                    <p>19. We must realize, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> said,
                        that it was one thing for Germany to declare among its allies that it
                        renounced the manufacture of atomic weapons, but quite another thing to ask
                        Germany to enter into a binding agreement with its major adversary, limiting
                        even further its capabilities in the nuclear field. This took more doing,
                        and public opinion should be prepared for it.</p>
                    <p>The brutal statement of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in
                        London to the effect that Germans had to take the agreement and like it,
                        added fuel to the flames. (<persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        had taken pains to obtain the exact text of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement and the actual text was even harsher
                        than that reported.) The argument that it was all intended to keep countries
                        like Israel and India from getting the bomb was not particularly convincing
                        to the German people, when they all understood the Soviet motivation behind
                        the agreement.</p>
                    <p>20. Even though no lesser a man than <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had called the agreement a Morgenthau Plan,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> did not despair of
                        reaching an acceptable text and he added, “I think we can come to
                        agreement.” Apropos of his relations with France, we wanted to dispel the
                        idea that either he or Germany was hypnotized by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> “like a rabbit by a snake.” They did seek to
                        pursue a continential policy of a constructive character, <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0574"/>but without in any way separating
                        themselves from their overseas allies. He used the expression that he was
                        “constantly attempting to keep France from going sour.”</p>
                    <p>21. He fully realized the need for “allied heads of state” to refrain from
                        criticizing each other or their government's policies in public, but when
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> made his attack on
                        Germany from British soil not one word was said in public repudiation of it.
                        The only statesman in Europe who had responded to such attacks from allied
                        soil (in this case by Podgorny) was Saragat. We can be sure that if anyone
                        from the other side made any such statements from German soil against the US
                        or any other ally, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> would
                        immediately and emphatically denounce it. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> referred to his statement in London to the effect
                        that he deplored the fact that no replies had been made by allied host
                        countries, when attacks had been made from their soil on another ally.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> repeated that it was
                        his wish to reclarify the whole atmosphere, and to this he would apply his
                        best efforts.</p>
                    <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> also referred to the
                        recent British statement regarding the Oder-Neisse line, presumably by
                        FonMin Brown, and to a statement made to <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        on his recent visit to Bonn. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        had said that he felt British-Russian relations had reached a high water
                        mark, when he had indicated to the Soviets that he was in favor of the
                        Oder-Neisse line. We must realize how difficult it was for any German leader
                        to acquiesce in any such sentiment. Perhaps this might be dealt with at some
                        future time in a new context, but any German who now publicly accepted the
                        Oder-Neisse line would have a “terrible record” with the German people. When
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> referred to the fact that
                        he had once advocated the acceptance of the Oder-Neisse line in return for
                        reunification and free elections, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> replied that he had recalled this and he sometimes
                        had “sleepless nights” wondering how he would handle such a proposal as this
                        if it came up.</p>
                    <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> also said that he wanted
                        to dissociate himself completely from any criticism cast against the US, or
                        against NATO, on the ground that neither had done anything to bring about
                        German reunification. This was totally unfair and the failure of
                        reunification was certainly no fault of the allies, and particularly not of
                        the US. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> stated that he had
                        the feeling that Germany's attitude toward its allies had not been made as
                        clear as it might have been, and in this respect he referred to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s anxiety to have the FRG bring
                        heavy and extensive pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> to force acceptance of British entry into the Common
                        Market. Germany was most anxious to have the British come in, but he felt
                        that heavy pressure from Germany in the form of a demand on France would not
                        be conducive toward achieving the desired result. This does not mean,
                        however, that they were lukewarm on this issue.</p>
                    <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0575"/>
                    <p>24. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> asked what attitude he
                        might take if the US reduced its forces by one division, with rotation,
                        emphasizing that the President had made no decision whatever in regard to
                        force levels and that he was asking solely for his own information.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> replied that it was an
                        interesting suggestion, but that he was not a military man and could not say
                        what effect it might have. He would be prepared to give more consideration
                        to the suggestion if the question ever came up.</p>
                    <p>25. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> concluded by saying
                        that, although our position was not to insist on specific agreements in
                        regard to military offsets, we would have a very hard time of it if, as
                        Strauss had suggested, Germany might commence the purchase of military
                        equipment in France. This would have the effect of reducing our offsets in
                        favor of France, whose troops in Germany were now uncommitted to NATO, while
                        ours were, and while the major deterrent in support of German security lies
                        overwhelmingly with the US. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        replied that this was not being seriously contemplated. Some suggestion had
                        been made that this might be possible in the 70's, but no such moves were
                        now in prospect.</p>
                    <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> gave the impression
                        of sincerity and real friendship for the US throughout the talk. He seemed
                        to have a full awareness of the President's difficult position, and the fact
                        that the President needed to gain all the information he could before he
                        could make a final decision. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> said that he would do his best to cooperate. He
                        asked particularly that <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        convey his regards and good wishes to the President. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> reported on the status of the
                        trilateral negotiations. He said the main problem was the UK-German gap. The
                        UK was prepared to take less than a 100 percent offset and would accept some
                        financial neutralization. However, there was still a $40 million shortfall
                        between the <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0576"/>UK's demand and the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s offer. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> would have his critical Cabinet meeting on March
                        15. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> had suggested
                        that a letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> before this meeting could have an important effect
                        in getting the Germans to improve their offer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said there were two issues:
                        (1) what we were prepared to do on our force levels in Germany, and (2)
                        what, if anything, we were prepared to do to help close the $40 million
                        gap.</p>
                    <p>The President asked for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s view on the second issue. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he did not favor the
                        US picking up any of the gap. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if a deal could be worked out on the following lines:</p>
                    <p>—the US to cut one division;</p>
                    <p>—the UK to cut only one brigade;</p>
                    <p>—the Germans and British to split the $40 million gap.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said that the last of these
                        would not work; it would be necessary for US to pick up some of the $40
                        million shortfall. He thought we could do this by rotating some of our air
                        wings to the UK instead of to the US. The President instructed his advisers
                        to get together and work out the figures on the $40 million gap, suggesting
                        ways in which the US could help bridge part of it. He emphasized that he
                        would not agree to having the US fill the entire $40 million gap.<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">The President met again with his advisers at 4:15 p.m.
                            on March 9. No record of this meeting has been found, but <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> prepared a memorandum for the
                            President saying that he was working on a list of ways the $40 million
                            gap could be filled, but that it would require real U.S. money.

                    <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>I very much appreciate the thoughts you expressed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on February 22. The warm friendship
                        between our two countries is a source of great strength, not only for our
                        own peoples but for the entire world community. I want you to know that this
                        Government will extend every effort to maintain a close and confident
                        working relation with you and your associates.</p>
                    <p>I want to thank you for receiving <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John
                            McCloy</persName>, who has given me a full report of his good talk with
                        you. And thank you also for your kind greetings.</p>
                    <p>The enterprise in which Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> are engaged is of great
                        importance to the future of the Atlantic Community we have all worked so
                        hard to fashion. It comes at a time when many NATO members are under strong
                        political and economic pressures which could jeopardize the broad objectives
                        of the Atlantic Alliance. I am strongly of the opinion that NATO troop
                        deployments and other security arrangements should only be altered when and
                        if the security situation permits. I hope that each of us will put first
                        things first, and not allow the growth and consolidation of a strong
                        Atlantic Community to be damaged by excessive concern with our own
                        short-term difficulties in disregard of the broader common interest.</p>
                    <p>This is why the United States position in the trilateral talks has rested on
                        the three interrelated principles which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> has already discussed with you:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the level of forces in Europe should be
                        determined by agreement among the Allies on the basis only of security
                        considerations, broadly construed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, it is for the German Government to decide
                        what military procurement it wishes to undertake in the light of its
                        commitments to the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the Allies should deal at the same time with
                        the remaining problem of neutralizing the foreign exchange consequences of
                        troop presence in Germany by cooperation in the management of monetary
                        reserves and other financial arrangements.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the simple offset concept—an advance agreement for military
                        purchases of prescribed amounts to offset the foreign exchange costs of U.S.
                        troops in Germany—can be superseded by arrangements appropriate to the full
                        range of military and financial relations which form the solid core of the
                        Atlantic Community. It is our strong hope that all of us will be able to
                        move toward a new basis of continuing financial cooperation which will both
                        strengthen the international monetary system and provide a firmer foundation
                        for the troop deployments essential to mutual security. I am encouraged in
                        this <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0578"/>respect by the results of
                        preliminary talks between our representatives and those of the
                        Bundesbank.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the arrangements between the Federal Republic and the United
                        Kingdom regarding the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> are also closely
                        related to the constructive handling of our own problem. A major <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> cut at this time would have damaging
                        consequences for the security of us all. Because of the especially difficult
                        economic circumstances of the U.K., arrangements on the U.S.-F.R.G. pattern
                        would be inadequate. German purchases inevitably play a greater role. In
                        review of your own budgetary problem, your willingness to try to find ways
                        to deal with the British problem is a real contribution to Alliance
                        solidarity. With imaginative efforts all around, I feel we can jointly work
                        out a constructive solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> will be communicating our ideas in more detail to
                        Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> will also be discussing
                        our views on the question of force levels and deployments. I know you
                        appreciate that I am under great pressure from the Congress and public
                        opinion to reduce our forces in Europe substantially. Some have urged a
                        withdrawal of two divisions and others even more. I am myself determined to
                        hold the line against any steps which would significantly weaken NATO. I am
                        convinced that a limited rotational plan, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> will explain, can satisfy NATO's
                        security requirements. This, together with a maximum effort by our NATO
                        Allies and a successful outcome of the trilateral talks over-all will
                        greatly help me in handling the pressures here at home.</p>
                    <p>A second matter is the problem of international liquidity and the current
                        negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the Group of
                        Ten. Rapid progress is needed this spring and summer to bring these
                        negotiations to a successful conclusion. Specifically, we believe that, by
                        the September meetings of the Bank and Fund, there should be agreement on a
                        contingency plan for the creation of new reserves. We intend to press for
                        such agreement even in the face of some resistance on the part of a few
                        countries. With so much at stake, I hope we can count on your support.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to mention the question of a non-proliferation treaty.
                        You may be certain that we are examining your comments on the draft text of
                        a treaty with utmost care. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> assured Vice-Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, the current draft has not been agreed upon with the
                        Soviet Union, but only reflects our explorations regarding a possible basis
                        of agreement. We have made quite clear to the Soviets our intention to
                        consult with our Allies before reaching any agreement. We intend that these
                        consultations be thorough and are prepared to take the necessary time for
                        the purpose. I hope that the talks which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> has had with your government have
                        been useful in advancing us toward a common viewpoint. You can rest assured
                        that we will make every effort <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0579"/>to
                        work out formulas which the Federal Republic and our other Allies will find
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>I know that the non-proliferation issue poses difficult problems for you.
                        However, in my judgment, an equitable treaty would be a most important step
                        toward the larger goal of bringing all nuclear weapons under effective
                        control. In the terms in which you expressed your concern to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, I think the treaty is
                        indeed imbedded in the common interest of our two nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor, I hope this letter will be the first of many communications
                        between the two of us. The strong bonds between the United States and the
                        Federal Republic have linked our countries in a broad spectrum of important
                        and complex endeavors. I consider it of great importance that we maintain a
                        frank and open correspondence through which we can exchange views,
                        impressions, and ideas. In particular, I very much hope that your schedule
                        will permit a meeting with each other on a not too distant date. I know that
                        your burdens are heavy and your time limited, but I hope that we may be able
                        to find agreement on the date, time and place.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName>Johnson</persName> joins me in extending our warmest greetings
                        and best wishes to you and your family.</p>

                            the resumed talks in telegram 7391 from London, March 14. (Ibid., DEF 1

                    <p>1. The British reversed their previous position and accepted ₤7 million
                        additional being spent by the U.S. as a result of transfers from France.</p>
                    <p>2. They did not accept F–111 acceleration.</p>
                    <p>3. They accepted ₤6 million of the ₤12.5 from the old deal as a contribution
                        to closing the gap.</p>
                    <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0580"/>
                    <p>4. They are prepared to settle for an additional ₤5–7 million as opposed to
                        the old ₤14–15 million figure.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> feels we should act quickly
                        to meet this and to meet it on the high side; that is, at ₤7 million rather
                        than ₤5 million. The balance the British are prepared to swallow via
                        neutralization and slippage.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> agreed that, aside from the
                        Germans deciding today to go to ₤41 million, the critical issue is to drive
                        forward now:</p>
                    <p>—To put the whole deal back into NATO context; and</p>
                    <p>—To find a longer term basis for neutralization arrangements, including
                        expanded German military and other purchases in the U.K.</p>
                    <p>7. In talking with <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> made it clear that the deal
                        involved:</p>
                    <p>—German generosity to the British;</p>
                    <p>—A British cut of not more than one brigade;</p>
                    <p>—A U. S. rotation of not more than one division.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> believes that we have come
                        to a good moment because the Germans are realizing there is not much to be
                        gotten from Paris and the process of opening up to the East will be slow.
                        Therefore, they probably are more ready than even a few weeks ago to think
                        of tightening up the West as a basis for their policy. The outcome of the
                        French election may have helped marginally.</p>
                    <p>9. As for means of meeting the British gap of, say, ₤7 million, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> feels that whether it comes from
                        additional U.S. military expenditures in Britain or from some of the German
                        funds already committed here is a matter of indifference. He does believe,
                        however, we should move promptly.</p>
                    <p>10. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> noted that the
                        European press is beginning to talk intelligently for the first time about
                        the problem; that is, saying what NATO needs is a foreign exchange
                        neutralization plan rather than a military offset plan; and it needs this on
                        a long term basis.</p>

                        March 21.</p>
                    <p>1. Trilateral March 20 meeting was taken up with statement by German
                        Principal on decisions affecting UK offset which were taken by March 15
                        meeting of German cabinet, and by response of British Principal setting
                        forth UK position in light of these decisions.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) read prepared statement that, in light of March 15 <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> cabinet meeting, he was authorized to
                        propose following as Germany offset contribution to UK for British 1967–1968
                        fiscal year: (a) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> undertakes to make DM
                        200 million available for military procurement and services in UK, of which
                        DM 50 million would be placed by end December 1967, and balance by end March
                        1968 if necessary through prepayment; (b) German public purchases in UK
                        during same period of “at least” DM 200 million, which <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would endeavor to increase if possible; and
                        (c) foregoing offers are based on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        assumption that UK forces in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would
                        remain at about present level during British 1967–1968 fiscal year.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> also noted cabinet
                        action to approve Bundesbank-Federal Reserve bond purchasing
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>'s statement continued with
                        following observations on force levels: (a) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> shares US view that force levels in Europe should be based
                        on security considerations only; (b) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        regards current force levels in Central Region as “about adequate but are
                        also necessary to ensure the security of the NATO area in accordance with
                        principles” of the Trilateral Minute of November 10 on conventional
                            forces;<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., DEF 4
                            NATO)</note> (c) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> believes that a
                        force withdrawal could be justified only if there were changes in present
                        strategic situation, primarily as result of Warsaw Pact withdrawals from
                        Eastern Europe including East Germany; (d) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> view that withdrawals or redeployments can have important
                        political impact on the Alliance; and (e) results of Trilateral Talks should
                        be put into NATO force planning forum and reflected in NATO five-year force
                        plan to be adopted by Defense Planning Committee next December.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> (UK) welcomed <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> cabinet decisions which he noted have
                        effect of restoring <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> offer of last
                        October, but pointed out that even so there remains a gap of 15–17 million
                        pounds in covering <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> costs of British
                        forces in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> now running at 82 million
                        pounds annually after taking into account recently achieved administrative
                        economies. <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0582"/>He said <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> could not accept this gap without some
                        force reductions. If FRG could agree to following “conditions,” <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> could limit its reduction in relation to
                        1967–1968 fiscal year (April 1, 1967–March 31, 1968) to one brigade group,
                        with implementation not to begin prior to January 1, 1968: (a) achievement
                        of some progress in British-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> discussions
                        now under way in Frankfurt for a bond purchasing arrangement similar to
                            US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> arrangement; (b) joint
                        undertaking by <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and UK to exert their
                        best efforts to achieve an additional German contribution of DM 50–100
                        million, through use for German commercial purchases of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> funds now on deposit in UK, and through
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> encouragement of German civil public
                        purchases; (c) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and US support of British
                        approaches to <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> and NATO for relief from
                        present UK obligation on maintaining forces on Continent; <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> stressed <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> view it would be appropriate to use this occasion to
                        relieve UK altogether from its unique and unilateral treaty obligation; and
                        (d) possibility of further British withdrawals in fiscal year 1968–1969
                        would be judged in light of offset arrangements achieved for that year.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> (US) recalled <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desire to base force levels on security
                        needs alone, and expressed dismay at prospect that, if this not done,
                        Trilateral Talks would have achieved only transitory results. He, therefore,
                        considered inappropriate approaches to force levels couched in terms of
                        “conditions.”</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> questioned <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName>'s figure of 82 million pounds for
                        current <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> costs of British forces in
                        Germany. He thought amount should be 75 million pounds, to accord with
                        amount cited in DM in joint communique issued last October at close of
                        British-German Ministerial Commission on offset. Figgures of British
                        Treasury pointed out latter amount as used in communique had included
                        proposed saving of 7–8 million pounds which <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had in mind making through reductions in logistical stocks
                        but had “adjourned” in response to Allied reactions.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> pressed <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> for early reaction to British
                        position he had stated. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> and
                        Harkort were reluctant to respond at this meeting but seemed indicate
                        readiness to consider recording in public joint statement British-German
                        willingness to make best efforts towards maximizing German purchases in UK
                        at levels higher than cabinet approved offers. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> wished be assured, which <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> did, that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not be held accountable for any shortfalls between
                        targets cited in such joint statement and cabinet approved undertakings.</p>
                    <p>7. Principals agreed that Report on “Reinforcement of Central Europe in an
                        Emergency” resulting from March 15–16 meeting of Working Group II, should be
                        conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> for attention of
                        NATO force planners. However, they agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> should not give force planners Part B of that paper,
                        concerning “Military Factors Involved in Any East-West Force Reduction,”
                        inasmuch as latter part is preliminary only. <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0583"/>Further, they agreed <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> should be asked to respond to queries from other NATO
                        members re Trilateral consideration of latter subject to effect that nothing

                            President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> visited Europe
                            March 28–April 8. A complete set of the reporting telegrams and
                            memoranda of his conversations is ibid.</note> (Following is approved
                        record of conversation)</p>
                    <p>1. Vice President said that Europe had changed a great deal in the past few
                        years, but one thing that had not changed was strong U.S. support of
                        European unity. What we sought was a full and equal partner, working in
                        concert with U.S.</p>
                    <p>2. President had told him before leaving Washington, Vice President said,
                        that he was authorized to say that (1) President was ready to meet his full
                        NATO commitment if others did, and (2) that he looked with strong favor on
                        developing political and economic unity in Europe. Vice President called
                        attention to his own March 5 speech at Fulton, Missouri, in which he said
                        that Atlantic cohesion remained a necessity. The building of a strong and
                        positive Alliance did not preclude better East-West relations; it was a
                        necessity for them. The U.S. also looked with favor upon a closer
                        French-German association. Friendship between France and Germany was vital
                        to a better and stronger Europe. There was nothing wrong with such an
                        association between nations so long as it did not become separatist and
                        inward.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> agreed with this. He said
                        that there were two sure talking lines which would bring enthusiasm from the
                        German people: one of <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0584"/>them was the
                        need for peace with the East; the other was the need for French-German
                        reconciliation. Such reconciliation, he said, was not a matter of
                        governments. Even bad governments would not be able to destroy it. It was an
                        expression of desire of French and German peoples. It was not a matter of
                        choosing between France and United States. France must always remain a
                        friend. The United States would always remain Germany's strongest and most
                        important partner.</p>
                    <p>4. Our interest in Europe is what it was and more, the Vice President said.
                        Our task now is to consult and work even more closely together. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> suggested that Vice President mention
                        to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> the
                        President's assurances re NATO and European unity.</p>

                        Subj: NATO Consultation. Ref: (a) Paris 14574; (b) Paris 14402.<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">Telegram 14574, March 21, reported a discussion of
                            consultation among the Fourteen. Telegram 14402, March 18, summarized
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s views on consultation
                            with France. (Both ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. This message deals first with question of French participation in NATO
                        consultation and second with further study of consultation and
                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>2. We believe that regardless of how one divides stages of phases of
                        consultation, general approach should be to encourage as much French
                        participation in consultation as possible. We concur your view that any
                        attempt get French to accept Athens Guidelines or other arrangements made in
                            NPG/<gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> would be exercise in futility
                        and might cause French and Fourteen unnecessary headaches. There should be
                        clear understanding among Fourteen that France would not be allowed to <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0585"/>inhibit discussions or
                        decision-making at any point in time of consultation cycle. Should France
                        have different views from its Allies, the Fourteen could note them and go on
                        with the task at hand.</p>
                    <p>3. This policy could also be applied to French participation in studies on
                        procedures for consultation. France could participate in studies to the
                        extent it desired but would not be allowed to impede the progress of such
                        studies. This of course implies <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as venue
                        for studies, but we believe that Fourteen should first develop an agreed
                        position on dealing with possible French obstruction, e.g., be prepared if
                        French obstructionism develops to move studies back to <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. We believe that it would be sufficient for Fourteen to reach agreement on
                        this general approach without further elaboration and without asking the
                        French for any assurances that they will not attempt to inhibit such
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>5. Foregoing comments should not be interpreted as disagreement with your
                        procedural suggestion in para 8 of Paris 14402. We agree that major effort
                        should be to: (1) make concrete improvements in Alliance's consultation
                        capability, and (2) utilize this capability more fully. We also agree that
                        prolonged study of consultation in the abstract is not very promising.
                        However, we understand some other Allies and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> value such studies more highly than does the US. We
                        do not wish to create impression by taking strong stand against further
                        studies that US either lukewarm about consultation or reneging on
                        Ministerial commitment. We, therefore, agree that if strong sentiment
                        develops for pursuing study tasks set forth in <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>/D(66)32<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">Not found.</note>
                        further, US should acquiesce.</p>
                    <p>6. We recall that Ministerial decision on follow-up studies was that <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> in permanent session would decide which
                        body should carry out these studies (para 1C Paris 9137).<note n="4" xml:id="d245fn4">Telegram 9137, December 15, 1966, summarized a session

                        decisions involving potential or actual use of nuclear weapons (e.g., host
                        country consultation). Other studies should attempt not to duplicate this
                        effort.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. At their first meeting, Ministers of the Nuclear Planning Group considered
                        matters related to:</p>
                    <p>(a) Strategic nuclear forces—including Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems
                        (ABMs).</p>
                    <p>(b) Tactical Nuclear Forces—including Atomic Demolition Munitions (<gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s).</p>
                    <p>(c) The role of Host Countries in the planning, storage and release for use
                        of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategic Nuclear Forces.</p>
                    <p>2. The Ministers reviewed the strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, and
                        examined the present and prospective increases in the rate of deployment of
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s that had become apparent since
                        the discussion in the Nuclear Planning Working Group in Washington in
                        February 1966. They agreed that the existing and programmed strategic
                        nuclear forces of the Alliance remain adequate for deterrence of large-scale
                        attack by the Soviet Union. They noted further that there appears to be no
                        way to prevent unacceptable damage to the West from a general nuclear
                        exchange.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Anti-Ballistic Missiles.</p>
                    <p>3. On the basis of a detailed US briefing on anti-ballistic missiles, the
                        Ministers concluded that, just as the US can be expected to react to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployments in the Soviet Union by
                        improvements in offensive missile forces, the Soviets could be expected to
                        react similarly to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployments in the
                        West. This would greatly increase defense expenditures on both sides without
                        improving the security of either, thus casting serious doubt on the value of
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployments against large-scale
                        attack. In this connection, the Ministers expressed their appreciation of
                        the willingness of the United States Government to consult closely in NATO
                        with its Allies. They agreed on the importance of the proposed US
                        discussions with the USSR in an effort to avoid escalation of the strategic
                        arms race.</p>
                    <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0587"/>
                    <p>4. The Ministers asked the Permanent Representatives to study, with the
                        assistance of the NATO military authorities, the implications of
                        anti-ballistic missiles for the NATO Allies of the United States.
                        Specifically, the study should consider the political and military
                        consequences of:</p>
                    <p>(a) No deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s by NATO
                        countries;</p>
                    <p>(b) Deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s in the US only;
                        and</p>
                    <p>(c) Deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s both in North America
                        and Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactical Nuclear Forces.</p>
                    <p>5. The Ministers also reviewed the conclusions on tactical nuclear forces
                        reached by the Nuclear Planning Working Group at its meeting in London on
                        28th/29th April, 1966. They discussed a paper regarding these conclusions
                        submitted by Italy and a paper submitted by Turkey on the use of Atomic
                        Demolition Munitions on the South-Eastern flank. They accepted that tactical
                        nuclear weapons available to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> appear to be sufficient in
                        quantity, but felt that both the mix of weapons and the circumstances in
                        which they might be used required further detailed study.</p>
                    <p>6. In considering the role of tactical nuclear weapons the Ministers
                        concluded that they constitute an essential element in a policy of
                        deterrence by the threat of escalation. Since the advantages to the Alliance
                        of initiating the use of tactical nuclear weapons would vary according to
                        the terrain and the circumstances, Ministers stressed the importance of
                        developing practical plans for the possible use of such weapons in
                        particular circumstances in various areas of Allied Command Europe. Plans of
                        this kind are particularly important since uncertainties, including the
                        question of possible Soviet responses, make it difficult to predict when it
                        would be of net advantage to NATO to initiate the use of tactical nuclear
                        weapons in response to an aggression less than general war.</p>
                    <p>7. The Ministers felt that developments since <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s Scheduled Program was originally prepared have made it
                        desirable to reexamine it as a basis for threatre nuclear operations. They
                        propose to work toward the development of theatre plans for the most
                        effective use of nuclear forces, with special reference to air forces
                        capable of performing both conventional support and nuclear strike
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>8. Ministers agreed to the following further studies relative to the use of
                        tactical nuclear weapons (including very low yield weapons) in the Center as
                        well as in the South.</p>
                    <p>(a) Studies, including consideration of political and military factors, of
                        the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in various contingencies (1) in
                        the Central Region and (2) in the Southern Region; such studies should
                        include the use of war-games techniques.</p>
                    <p>(b) Based on such studies, development with the Military Committee and <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> of a concept for the use of theatre
                        nuclear weapons, <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0588"/>within which
                        military commanders would develop detailed plans for the employment of such
                        weapons for deterrence and defense in various contingencies.</p>
                    <p>(c) Development by the Military Committee and <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> for NPG consideration of plans for Atomic Demolition
                        Munitions both in the Central and Southeastern regions of Allied Command
                        Europe. (In view of the special features of <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s, Ministers agreed that the studies to be undertaken on
                        their possible use and on possible special release procedures should be
                        carried out separately from those on the use of other tactical nuclear
                        weapons.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Role of Host Countries.</p>
                    <p>9. The Ministers considered a paper by the Federal Republic of Germany on the
                        role of host countries with respect to planning, storage, and release of
                        nuclear weapons. They agreed that:</p>
                    <p>(a) There should be more effective arrangements for national participation in
                        military nuclear planning. The Secretary General will arrange, with the
                        assistance of the Military Committee, to present to the Nuclear Planning
                        Group a proposal to make such participation possible.</p>
                    <p>(b) Host countries should have adequate information concerning the
                        stockpiling of weapons in their territory. The Federal Republic and other
                        interested countries were asked to specify the kinds of information they
                        would require on this subject.</p>
                    <p>(c) On arrangements for release of nuclear weapons, the Ministers asked their
                        Permanent Representatives to consider possible types of arrangements and
                        report back at a later meeting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Meeting.</p>
                    <p>10. Ministers agreed that the next Ministerial Meeting should take place in
                        Ankara in September 1967.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Secretary said that the British Cabinet will probably take a
                        positive decision in about the next two weeks to apply for British entry
                        into the Europe Economic Communities. The debates in the Parliamentary Party
                        so far have gone much better than had been hoped. There was a larger
                        majority in the Parliamentary Party in favor of entry than in the Cabinet.
                        There is no real political problem about this and the House of Commons will
                        certainly approve.</p>
                    <p>The British would like to take their Cabinet decision about May 4. They will
                        have to announce it publicly and would aim for Parliamentary debate straight
                        away. Immediately after the Parliamentary debate they would submit their
                        application to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Since vacations
                        begin in July the British must apply by May in order to accomplish something
                        before the vacation period. The House recesses on the 12th of May for two
                        weeks. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> will be in Moscow the
                        last week of the recess and then immediately after his return Prime Minister
                        Wilson goes to Canada for Expo '67. Unless they take their decision the week
                        before the recess the application would not get in before June and after the
                        Rome <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Summit Meeting, a situation the
                        British wish to avoid. If the Kennedy Round is not out of the way the
                        British could wait until May 8 at the latest. They wondered whether
                        submitting their application while the Kennedy Round is still in process
                        might give the French a handle to create difficulties and possibly torpedo
                        the KR. The British don't think so but would like to check with us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> thought that coming so close
                        to the end of the KR it seemed unlikely the British application would affect
                        it adversely. However, he asked for time to check this point with others and
                        promised to get a message to the Foreign Secretary before his departure.</p>
                    <p>(After discussing the question with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> of the White House Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> that we hoped the UK would target for May 8 rather than
                        May 4; that at the moment the KR was in a state of semi-crisis; and that he
                        thought it might be a good idea for the UK to take another look at the
                        status <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0590"/>of the KR about May 1 and
                        talk with us again to see whether there was likely to be any problem.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether there was anything we could do to help the
                        British. We had been remaining quiet because we felt that any open support
                        by us would simply be counter-productive. The Foreign Secretary said, “not
                        now,” but later perhaps we could help to stiffen the Germans a bit. Some of
                        the Germans are so desirous of re-creating Franco-German amity on the basis
                        of the '63 treaty that they may need a little bolstering at the right
                        moment. Contrary to press reports the Germans have not urged or suggested to
                        the British any delay in their application.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, the Foreign Secretary said the British were
                        preparing a short, simple and clean application. There will be no conditions
                        in the application but these will be made clear in a statement to be made in
                        the House of Commons after the British Cabinet decision. He did not believe
                        these “conditions” would provide the General with a basis for exercising
                        another veto. While there are divided opinions in Britain on this question
                        the majority of British officials believe that the General will not be able
                        to veto their application either at the beginning or during the course of
                        the negotiations but that the French will try to stall and protract the
                        negotiations as long as possible. The Foreign Secretary said that at his
                        last meeting with General de Gaulle he had the impression the General was
                        very uncomfortable about France's isolated position on this question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if the US could help at any time that the British
                        should let us know. He suggested that in the statement to the House of
                        Commons a word other than “conditions” might be used (the Foreign Secretary
                        agreed). He expressed the hope that when the British got into Europe they
                        would do something to end Europe's isolation from the rest of the world.
                        Europe's attitude seemed to be one of exclusive concern with their own
                        problems and indifference with respect to everything else. He had tried to
                        stimulate NATO's interest in the Middle East and Africa, which were right
                        next door to Europe, but to no avail. The Foreign Secretary said that the
                        British have this very much in mind but that obviously for the moment they
                        were not going to advertise it.</p>

                    <p>Dear Senator Mansfield:</p>
                    <p>The attached memorandum contains replies to the questions raised in your
                        letter to me on April 14, 1967.<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">The attachment
                            is not printed. Mansfield's letter asked for a summary of the trilateral
                            talks and a reply on what political and military purposes the current
                            level of U.S. forces in Europe served. (Ibid.)</note> As you know, I
                        shall be out of the country on April 26. I have therefore asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> to represent the
                        Department of State at the hearing.</p>
                    <p>In replying to your questions, I should like to make an introductory comment
                        on allied force levels in Europe.</p>
                    <p>I start with the premise that our forces should be stationed abroad only for
                        reasons of national security, and that they should be withdrawn only if
                        considerations of security justify such a move. In this connection we should
                        keep in mind that all troop withdrawals are politically sensitive signals,
                        and their significance can be misconstrued.</p>
                    <p>The national interests of the United States continue to require a strong
                        Atlantic Alliance, and a strong and balanced NATO force under integrated
                        command in Europe. It would be unthinkable for us to risk the loss of
                        Western Europe, or the loss of its independence. While the deterrent
                        strength of NATO, and the pressure of events in the Far East, have led the
                        Soviet Union to pursue a relatively mild course in Europe since 1962, the
                        military strength of the Warsaw Pact Powers deployed in Eastern Europe is
                        formidable, and rising. We can hope that the Soviet Union has come to accept
                        the principle, at least for Europe, that unilateral change by force in the
                        frontiers of the two systems is a danger to world peace. But in my view, we
                        must not dismantle defenses which have been, and are, so successful until we
                        have something more tangible than hope on which to base a policy of detente
                        and coexistence.</p>
                    <p>Even if the change in the Soviet political posture were far greater than any
                        of us can now predict, there would still be a need to balance Soviet
                        military preponderance in Europe. In the hands of any Soviet Government,
                        military preponderance could be used as political leverage in a way which
                        could damage our many interests in cooperation with Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the nuclear age, the United States is the only NATO power with strategic
                        resources to match Soviet military power. Strong American <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0592"/>forces on the ground must be the core of a
                        non-nuclear defense of Europe. Without such a rallying point for Allied
                        strength in conventional forces, all the advantages of our posture of
                        flexible response would be lost.</p>
                    <p>The presence of our forces in Europe under NATO has also contributed to the
                        development of intra-European cooperation. Much progress has been made. But
                        without the visible assurance of a sizeable American contingent, old
                        frictions may revive, and Europe could become unstable once more.</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and
                        the United States have now completed the task assigned to them and submit
                        this report as a record of the results of the talks.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p>The three representatives held a total of six formal sessions on:</p>
                    <p>October 20–21, 1966; November 9–10, 1966; November 28–30, 1966; February 27
                        and March 3, 1967; March 20–21, 1967; and April 27–28, 1967.</p>
                    <p>They also consulted informally a number of times; and they were assisted by
                        several Working Groups. The Secretary General of NATO or his representative
                        attended all of the formal sessions. A representative of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> attended some of the Working

                    <p>In addition to the Working Group reports, the talks have resulted in the

                    <p>It is understood that the carrying out of the agreed financial arrangements
                        will be handled through regular channels and that the further discussions of

                    </p>
                    <p>1. In order to deter aggression, the Alliance needs a full spectrum of
                        military capabilities ranging from conventional forces through tactical
                        nuclear weapons to strategic nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>2. The strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, with their ability to
                        inflict catastrophic damage on Soviet society even after a surprise nuclear
                        attack, constitute the backbone of NATO's military capabilities.</p>
                    <p>3. The tactical nuclear capabilities of the Alliance constitute an additional
                        necessary component of the deterrent.</p>
                    <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0594"/>
                    <p>4. The Alliance needs sufficient conventional forces to deter and counter a
                        limited non-nuclear attack and to deter any larger non-nuclear attack by
                        confronting the Soviets with the prospect of non-nuclear hostil-ities on
                        such a scale as to involve for them a grave risk of escalation to nuclear
                        war.</p>
                    <p>5. On the Central Front, the present level of NATO forces appears to be
                        adequate for this purpose but the question of imbalances in these forces
                        remains to be discussed.</p>
                    <p>6. The question of where these forces should be located remains to be
                        discussed in the light of the prospect of political and military warning,
                        ability to react, capacity and speed of reenforcement, economic
                        considerations and the political impact of any new deployments on NATO and
                        the Warsaw Pact.</p>

                    <p rend="center">AGREED MINUTE</p>
                    <p>This minute applies only to year 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968.</p>
                    <p>The German Government will make purchases in the defense sector from the UK
                        of the value of DM 200 million in the financial year April 1, 1967 to March
                        31, 1968.</p>
                    <p>The German Government will endeavor within the limits of its possibilities to
                        reach DM 250 million for public procurements in the civilian sector in the
                        same period.</p>
                    <p>The British and German Governments will use their best endeavors to promote
                        commercial purchases with a view to reaching accountable payments of up to
                        DM 100 million in the same period. The remaining funds, not yet
                        contractually committed in the DM 94 million account will be used for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>The undertakings in the three preceding paragraphs are based on the
                        assumption that the principles of the agreement of 1964 as extended by the
                        Protocol of 1965 and the decisions of the Anglo-German Joint Committee
                        continue to apply.</p>
                    <p>The two Governments will now enter into a new agreement on the above
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Subject to the agreement of <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, the British
                        Government will withdraw one brigade group (about 5,000 men) from Germany to
                        the United <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0595"/>Kingdom during the first
                        quarter of 1968. This brigade group will remain earmarked for assignment to
                        NATO. Apart from the physical implications of its change of location, there
                        will be no change in its relation to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. In addition, and on the same basis, the British
                        Government would propose to transfer to the UK two squadrons of the 2nd
                        Tactical Air Force.</p>
                    <p>When the British Government make the necessary application to <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, the German Government, taking account of
                        the balance of payments arguments advanced, will use its best endeavors to
                        ensure the success of the application as being the only solution which has
                        been found in the tripartite talks.</p>
                    <p>The US and German Governments will similarly support the agreed position in
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>These understandings are contingent on the completion of satisfactory
                        financial and force level arrangements between the United States and the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and UK in the Trilateral Talks and
                        will become effective only in conjunction with such related
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p rend="center">AIDE-MEMOIRE</p>
                    <p>The Department of State confirms the statement made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to Minister <persName corresp="#p_TGM1">Thomson</persName> on March 20, 1967, to the effect
                        that the United States Government is prepared—as a contribution to the
                        satisfactory conclusion of the Trilateral Talks on force levels and balance
                        of payments effects—to increase its military orders and payments to the
                        United Kingdom by the amount of 7 million pounds in the period April 1, 1967
                        to March 31, 1968. The orders and payments would be additional to those
                        undertaken under the $325 million arrangement, and additional to those
                        undertaken under the special $35 million arrangement agreed in December
                        1966. They would be subject to the same terms as transactions under the $325
                        million and $35 million arrangements. United States experts are prepared to
                        discuss the modalities of these new transactions with their British
                        counterparts in the immediate future.</p>

                    <p>This offer is predicated on the assumption that the three governments can
                        reach a satisfactory agreement on the level of forces in Germany.</p>

                    <p rend="center"> US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> MINUTE</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. US Rotation Plans</p>
                    <p>1. The United States proposes to redeploy from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to the US up to 35,000 military personnel. The ground and
                        air units affected, whether at their US or <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> bases, will remain fully committed to NATO.</p>
                    <p>2. Army. The plan for the Army is as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. The US Army division involved will be the 24th Infantry Division.</p>
                    <p>b. At least one brigade of that division will be in Germany at all times, at
                        the current location of the division. Consideration will be given at a later
                        date to restationing the units, if the availability of facilities permits,
                        to place them closer to their assigned emergency defense positions.</p>
                    <p>c. The other two brigades and an appropriate share of divisional and
                        non-divisional support units—totalling approximately 28,000 (i.e., slightly
                        less than two-thirds of a US division force)—will be removed from Germany to
                        the United States. Precisely which support units will be redeployed has not
                        been decided. US military experts are ready to work with German military
                        experts to find ways to avoid weakening combat support units.</p>
                    <p>d. Once a year, all three brigades will be in Germany for exercises involving
                        the entire division.</p>
                    <p>e. The rotation plan provides that the three brigades would succeed each
                        other in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, each brigade in turn
                        remaining in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on TDY for a period of
                        six months.</p>
                    <p>f. Forces redeployed to the US will be maintained in a high degree of
                        readiness, and equipment will be maintained in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in sufficient quantity and readiness to ensure that the
                        forces can be redeployed to Germany within 30 days. The US Government will
                        strive to shorten the time requirements for the deployment of ground forces
                        as much as possible below 30 days.</p>
                    <p>3. Air Force. The plan for the Air Force is as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. The three tactical fighter wings, totaling 216 aircraft, now based in
                        Germany are involved in the plan.</p>
                    <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0597"/>
                    <p>b. 120 of the 216 aircraft will be in Germany at all times. They will be
                        located on two or three bases, with the remainder of the four bases
                        maintained as DOB(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>c. 96 of the aircraft (and up to 6500 men) will be redeployed to the US.</p>
                    <p>d. All 216 of the aircraft will be together in Germany once a year for
                        exercises.</p>
                    <p>e. Under the rotation plan, 120 aircraft (five squadrons of 24 each) would be
                        permanently stationed in Germany, and the remaining 96 dual-based aircraft
                        would rotate to Germany for exercises once a year.</p>
                    <p>f. The aircraft in the US will be at a high degree of readiness to assure
                        their deployment to Europe within 10 days. The US Government will strive to
                        shorten the time requirements for the deployment of air forces to 5
                        days.</p>
                    <p>4. First movements under both plans will not take place before January 1,
                        1968, and the plans may be in operation as soon as June 30, 1968, but in no
                        event before the US is ready to meet the criteria described above.</p>
                    <p>5. The United States will return its rotating forces to Europe whenever the
                        situation requires. In addition, the US Government is ready to negotiate a
                        plan under which NATO countries, including Germany and others as well as the
                        US, furnish the assurance that comparable actions will be taken, including,
                        for the part of the US, redeployment to Europe of its rotating forces during
                        a period of political tension and no later than at the time of the
                        announcement of the alert phase “military vigilance” for the Central Region
                        by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. The US does not consider that the international situation justifies any
                        further redeployments. The US believes that significant reductions of allied
                        military strength should be part of a balanced plan for reducing military
                        strength in both East and West or as a consequence of other major shifts in
                        the security situation and should be made only after full consultation among
                        the allies. The US is prepared to participate in a multilateral
                        determination of what the NATO force levels should be.</p>
                    <p>7. The two governments agree that the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> is
                        the best forum to consider:</p>
                    <p>a. How agreed redeployment of US and UK forces should be handled for the

                    <p>Financial arrangements to deal with the balance of payments effects of US
                        military expenditures in Germany have been developed between the US and

                        30, 1968</p>
                    <p>1. Germany decides what levels of procurement of military goods and services
                        in the US it wishes to undertake.</p>
                    <p>2. It is recognized that the total of the prospective German military
                        purchases does not match the US foreign exchange expenditures in Germany for
                        military purposes.</p>
                    <p>3. As to the remaining balance of payments consequences of the US troops
                        stationed in Germany, other means, including cooperation in the management
                        of monetary reserves, have been agreed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">German Military Purchases in the US, July 1,
                        1967–June 30, 1968</p>
                    <p>1. The German Government intends to continue procurement of military goods
                        and services in the United States on a scale significant in relation to the
                        German defense effort. Such procurement will be made in the light of German
                        military requirements and budget capabilities, given the availability and
                        economic advantage of procurement items in the US.</p>
                    <p>2. The two governments will continue the regular military and financial
                        consultations between their appropriate ministries, which in the past have
                        served as a means for determining potential German military procurement in
                        the United States.</p>

                        1968</p>
                    <p>The two governments noted that the Bundesbank will invest during the period
                        July, 1967, through June, 1968, a sum of $500 million in special,
                        medium-term US Government securities, which will be a real import of capital
                        into the US.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Central Bank Arrangements</p>
                    <p>The two governments noted that in a recent letter addressed to the Chairman
                        of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, accompanied by a letter of
                        approval by the German Government, the Bundesbank explained its continuing
                        practice in recent years of not converting dollars into gold from the US
                        Treasury. The Bank stated its intention also in the future to continue this
                        policy and to play its full part in contributing to international monetary
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future Procedures</p>
                    <p>1. It is understood that there is no need to describe these specific
                        financial arrangements in NATO. However, it is recognized that it will be
                        necessary for the parties to describe these arrangements as questions are
                        posed in other existing international forums where subjects of monetary
                        cooperation arise.</p>
                    <p>2. Specific publicity will be coordinated between the US and the Bundesbank
                        with respect to the Central Bank arrangements.</p>

                    <p>The British Permanent Representative in the Defence Planning Committee will,

                        general terms the financial arrangements made between the German and British
                        Governments and put forward a British proposal, subject to the agreement of
                            <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, to transfer to the UK one brigade
                        group and one helicopter squadron in the first quarter of 1968, emphasizing
                        that these forces would remain committed to NATO.</p>
                    <p>The US Permanent Representative will outline in general terms the financial

                        the US proposals for redeploying certain of its forces committed to
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>The two Permanent Representatives will offer to provide such further
                        information on their force proposals as their allies may request and will
                        say that their governments will be explaining these proposals in greater
                        detail in the course of the NATO Defense Planning review. The German
                        Permanent Representative, in his statement, will confirm his government's
                        concurrence with these proposals.</p>

                    <p>Public announcement of the proposed moves should follow as soon as possible

                        This recognition of basic political nature and objective of European

                        Many of our difficulties are financial or economic. We need a detailed study
                        of whether mutual troop withdrawals from Europe are in the U.S.
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>General Wheeler: The Joint Chiefs are reviewing their earlier study of mutual
                        troop withdrawals.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: It is
                        necessary for us to convince Europeans that they must increase their
                        economic assistance to the Third World. The current NATO study is turning
                        out to be interesting. A further study must be made of the problems of
                        British admission to the Common Market. We are “living with” the problems
                        which arise out of the desire of European states to play a larger role.</p>
                    <p>The President: Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        made a point about a greater consultation with the United States. He said
                        the quantity of information exchanged is adequate, but the quality is not.
                        We should study closely the choices available to us which are pointed up by
                        the current NATO review.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The quality of
                        our consultation on nuclear matters with our allies has been poor for the
                        last ten years, but we are improving it.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: The State Department
                        paper is discouraging. In addition, it overlooks our major problem, i.e.,
                        can we live with actions which our European allies are taking in the field
                        of financial affairs? Is it possible for us to reach a rational financial
                        accommodation with the Common Market? Can we halt a process which during the
                        last eight years has led to our reserves going down and theirs going way up?
                        We are carrying on constant consultation with our NATO allies but this isn't
                        producing a solution.</p>
                    <p>France is trying either to expel us completely from Europe or at least to
                        diminish our power there. The French may even use the Common Market to
                        achieve this objective. We must face up to the problem of how to make a
                        coordinated effort in which all U.S. departments and agencies participate to
                        induce Germany and Italy to separate themselves from the French effort to
                        use the Common Market against the United States. Treas-ury views on this
                        problem will be presented in a paper for circulation to the Council.</p>
                    <p>The President: On our recent European trip<note n="4" xml:id="d251fn4">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> visited
                            Germany April 23–26 for the funeral of former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</note> we spent a great deal
                        of time on this problem and we will continue to do so. However, it is
                        doubtful that acceptable solutions can be found.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: The French have been
                        trying to use the Common Market structure for the past five years in an
                        effort to diminish our economic, political, and military influence. This
                        French effort in Europe affects our ability to be effective in other parts
                        of the world.</p>
                    <p>The President: The Vice President has been working on this problem. Perhaps
                        he has views on how we go about finding a solution. It is doubtful that the
                        Europeans will agree to arrangements offsetting the cost of U.S. divisions
                        now deployed in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: Europeans have rejected the world after the loss of their
                        colonies. They resent U.S. power. detente is what they want. Their young
                        people are causing many problems. The Soviets are still actively seeking the
                        dissolution of NATO.</p>
                    <p>We should review carefully our exchange of persons program. Its emphasis
                        should be on the young. No one over 40 should be brought to the United
                        States under the program.</p>
                    <p>We should get the Europeans involved in conferences on subjects other than
                        foreign policy; for example, Interior Secretary Udall's participation in the
                        conference on air pollution. The conference on mass transportation is
                        another example. We should organize conferences which approach problems on a
                        functional basis; for example, low income housing, education, urban
                        affairs.</p>
                    <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0603"/>
                    <p>The Europeans are selfish. We should challenge them to participate in the
                        world outside their borders. We must keep pounding at them on this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The President: We are doing this. Only the press is saying that we are
                        overemphasizing Asia and are oriented toward Asia. Special missions have
                        been sent and should continue to be sent to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We must
                        involve the people of Europe and get the public to put pressure on their
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: It is not enough for
                        us to limit our activity to discussions by U.S. Ambassadors at the top level
                        of foreign governments.</p>
                    <p>The President: We should not be so defensive in our approach. We should tell
                        the Europeans of our problems and of their responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: All legislative delegations going to Europe should be
                        carefully and fully briefed to ensure that what they say fits in with our
                        policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>The President: The study we are making of mutual troop withdrawals should
                        clearly spell out the choices we have. How can we persuade Europe to
                        contribute more to the defense effort and how can we persuade our Congress
                        to support our current participation in NATO? Should we call a conference on
                        how to distribute fairly the cost of maintaining NATO forces with a view to
                        getting firm commitments from our European allies? A showdown in this
                        country is coming soon. What do we do if the Kennedy Round negotiations
                        fail, if our trilateral financial discussions do not produce a satisfactory
                        solution, and if NATO study does not produce a satisfactory solution for the
                        future of NATO?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Director Leonard Marks: <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> has a serious problem communicating with
                        Europe. The European press is hostile, especially the Agence France press.
                        How do we counteract this hostility? We now have 50 percent fewer people
                        stationed in Europe and are spending only $7 million in the European area.
                        One way would be to create events which would attract attention. We could
                        send personalities to Europe who would command the news. The Vice President
                        and others should be sent on trips to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Goldberg: The Europeans are causing problems for us in the United
                        Nations. We no longer have a solid bloc of western allies behind us. The
                        British are OK but the Italians are tottering in their support of us.
                        Canadian support is poor.</p>
                    <p>The view of the European delegations to the United Nations is that the U.S.
                        is neglecting Europe for Asia. They complain of only being informed rather
                        than consulted. We need to caucus with them often and to arrange ways of
                        getting them more involved.</p>
                    <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0604"/>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: Europe is neglecting the world. It is in an isolationist cycle.
                        We should get one of our Senators to make this point in a major speech.</p>
                    <p>The President: While agreeing with the sentiment expressed, what we need is a
                        solution. A substantial part of my time is spent dealing with Europeans. We
                        have sent our leaders to Europe—the Vice President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, and others. There has been a very
                        large exchange of information. Even with all of this, all the Europeans say
                        they are neglected. What we need to do is to find a solution. We must find a
                        way of getting them to make a larger contribution to the cost of NATO
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: The recipients of our
                        aid must be more active. The point of diminishing returns has set in on our
                        begging for others in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: The action of
                        Europeans in the International Development Bank is an example of their
                        attitude. Henceforth, they should participate in decisions in the Bank on
                        the basis of their financial participation.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned the discussion to Senator Mansfield's concern that
                        the United Nations is unable to do anything about the war in Vietnam.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> summarized the pros and
                        cons of United Nations action, taking the same position he has in the past.
                        Ambassador Goldberg reviewed the past history of the proposal to involve the
                        U.N. and the difficulties which have arisen.</p>

                    <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0605"/>
                    <p>1. We agree generally with your approach to question of mutual force
                        reduction. Expression of continuing US interest in this matter and proposal
                        to locate study of force reductions within framework of force planning
                        processes seems good method of beginning tentative consideration of this
                        important subject. Obviously political and arms control aspects will also
                        have to be given prominent consideration as you suggest in para 7 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. We hope, as you suggest, it will be
                        possible to work out an agreed approach to study of mutual force reduction
                        in anticipation of the December Ministerial meeting.</p>
                    <p>2. We also agree British should clearly understand there will be no approach
                        to the Soviets at this time on question of reciprocal reductions and that if
                        they raise the matter they will be speaking absolutely for themselves.
                        Rather than attempting to make preconditions as suggested para 3 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, we would prefer you make points in
                        context of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> discussion.</p>
                    <p>3. In this connection and in connection with the matter of working out
                        reductions with the Soviets which you raise in paragraph 7 of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, we believe that for a number of
                        reasons the Soviet Union does not favor formal negotiation at this time. As
                        recently as February, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in a
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> made
                        settlement of European frontiers a prerequisite for mutually agreed
                        reduction of forces. This was an entirely new precondition. Other high
                        Soviet officials (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Abrasimov to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, March 17, 1967. End
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) have indicated that the USSR would
                        wait for deeds not words as regards reciprocal withdrawals and that Soviets
                        would withdraw troops from East Germany only after a Western reduction.
                        While no Soviet reduction appears imminent, we believe, nevertheless, that
                        the “mutual example” approach is more promising than any public or private
                        approach directed specifically at the USSR which would make any subsequent
                        Soviet reduction appear to be collaborative with the United States or with
                        NATO. From our point of view avoidance of formal approaches to the Soviets
                        offers greater prospect that they will, in fact, make some reductions in the
                        future once they can be dissociated from specific US and UK actions.</p>
                    <p>4. Any studies undertaken, of course, as suggested in paragraph 6 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> by force planners would concentrate
                        on the political and military effects of any changes in Soviet force levels.
                        Possible Western redeployments could be designed to fit into this evolving
                        process in such a manner that the relative Western strength in relation to
                        Soviet strength in Europe would not be impaired. (And, in this connection,
                        we agree with the point in middle your paragraph 3 that US/UK redeployment
                        now under discussion are not reductions. This does not mean that Soviets
                        cannot respond by redeployment of their own.)</p>
                    <p>5. We see no objection to French participation in the exercise on ad hoc
                        basis as you propose, although we remain skeptical that they will in <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0606"/>the long run make a positive
                        contribution to any multilateral effort to reach agreement on force
                        levels.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said it seems to him the
                        General had spoken more strongly in 1967 than in 1963 on the subject of UK
                        entrance. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> replied
                        that in 1963 there may have been some British misunderstanding about the
                        French position. Macmillan may not have been entirely clear about the
                        General's thoughts, but this time the British knew what the General was
                        going to say. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName>
                        continued that the problems of agriculture and the Commonwealth are perhaps
                        the most difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>
                        commented that the British had, he thought, accepted negotiation on the
                        agricultural question. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> said that not just France has difficulties with the
                        British on agricultural <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0607"/>and
                        “technical” matters, but France is more willing than its partners in the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to speak openly about them. The
                        Italians, he stated, could in no way make concessions to the British on
                        agricultural questions. British membership, he said, is not for today, not
                        for 1967. The only solution seems to be to find some formula for British
                        association or to postpone consideration of British entry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in his defense of the Common
                        Market sounds like Jean Monnet. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> has always believed in the Common Market and is very
                        close to Monnet's views on this matter, but that he simply does not want Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HW5">Hallstein</persName> as the Prime Minister of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> said that the
                        conclusion of the Kennedy Round was a great success. The French, and
                        particularly <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>, have always
                        wanted this negotiation to succeed. It is a revolutionary step in which we
                        have made an agreement on grains and food aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> agreed that the results of the
                        Kennedy Round were a great success and recalled that the food aid plan was a
                        French idea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> said
                        that with the great cuts in tariff in France, “We will all be driving
                        Cadillacs.”</p>
                    <p>Returning for a moment to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        press conference, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName>
                        said that he did not care for the Reston article in the May 19 <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> commenting on the press conference. He
                        was offended by Reston's facetious remark to the effect that the General
                        disagrees with the British opinion that the Americans are really members of
                        the human race. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> replied
                        that Mr. Reston is very tough on everyone from time to time, not just
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You will recall at the NSC discussion of the State Department paper “Problems
                        Ahead in Europe”<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">See <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> I criticized the paper as being
                        incomplete and inadequate and asked for permission to submit a supplementary
                            <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0608"/>paper as a part of the
                        educative enterprise for those concerned with military, political, economic
                        and cultural relationships with that part of the world.</p>
                    <p>The principal point of my criticism was that the listing of specific problems
                        we have with Western Europe included such things as</p>
                    <p>“(1) U.K. Entry Into <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(2) U.K. Financial Problem.</p>
                    <p>(3) Political Side of NATO.</p>
                    <p>(4) U.S., Western Europe and Third World.“ but omitted any treatment of what
                        I believe to be at least a major specific problem with Europe—particularly
                        the Common Market—namely, what I shall term “The Financial Problem”.</p>
                    <p>I raise this question in a National Security Council context because the
                        financial problem grows out of the disparities in burden-sharing relative to
                        financial strength which result from political, diplomatic and military
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In essence, I am appealing to the other parts of the Government [that] we
                        give a far higher priority to the importance of viable financial
                        arrangements with Western Europe, particularly the Common Market, in all
                        military, political, economic and cultural activities.</p>
                    <p>It is my conviction that this financial problem with Western Europe is our
                        Achilles heel which, more than any of the specific problems listed in the
                        State Department paper, are a threat to our position in Western Europe and
                        the effectiveness of our foreign policy in dealing with it.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I have taken the liberty of preparing the attached paper on the
                        financial aspects of U.S.-European relationships<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">Not printed.</note>—again for the same background purposes that the
                        previous paper was circulated.</p>
                    <p>The principal menace to our position in Western Europe, in my judgment, is
                        the desire of the French, under DeGaulle, to expel us as a practical matter
                        from Western Europe. The principal tools which are being employed to achieve
                        that result are blocking measures to achieve a better multilateral sharing
                        of responsibilities by the Common Market partners while the U.S. follows a
                        course which it cannot afford much longer.</p>
                    <p>If the U.S. is to be effective in partnership with Western Europe and we are
                        to avoid a two-bloc system in the Free world, the relative burdens must be
                        attuned to financial viability. The purpose and thrust of our major
                        political and diplomatic effort must be to effect a more viable and durable
                        financial partnership than our diplomacy has provided in the last decade
                        since the Common Market was established.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> raised this question.
                        Answering the Secretary, Sir Burke Trend said that the British side had
                        nothing more on the Rome Summit meetings of the Six than had appeared in the
                        papers. The 5 seemed to be taking the problem more seriously than before. He
                        personally was not as pessimistic as some over <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s negative remarks at his last press conference,
                        which seemed to him defensive.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that the second British application, which was simple
                        and clean, would be harder to resist than the first. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would not be able to veto the
                        start of negotiations over the strong support of the 5 but could spin them
                        out. Sir Burke Trend wondered aloud about how long the negotiations could go
                        on but made no estimate.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the US had been quiet in public about its support for
                        British entry. He asked whether we should continue this policy. Sir Burke
                        Trend said yes.</p>
                    <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0610"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said we realized that in this process the British might have to
                        “cock a snoot” at us from time to time and we understood this. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> added “but don't sell us
                        out on the liquidity problem.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow said that German Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> had been impressed by the argument that British
                        membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would bring with it a
                        great contribution in the technological field; this might be Britain's
                        strongest card. The UK side observed that the technological argument was
                        simply another way of spelling out the advantages of a large market. Sir
                        Solly Zuckerman referred in this connection to a recent Department of
                        Commerce article on “Innovation” which was having a very powerful effect in
                        Europe in reinforcing the Common Market idea.</p>

                            7, reported the NATO Permanent Representatives' concern about the Middle
                            East crisis. In paragraph 5, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> added that he had not suggested any particular
                            consultation process, but had emphasized the need for “open-endedness”
                            and the possibility of including special policy officers; paragraph 8
                            noted that policy toward the Middle East should be framed with
                            particular reference to East-West relations. Telegram 208534, June 6,
                            provided a preliminary assessment of the questions that the Middle East
                            crisis raised for NATO. (Both ibid.)</note> Subj: NATO Ministerial
                        Meeting and the Middle East. This message provides guidance requested for
                        June 9 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting:</p>
                    <p>1. We are in general agreement with your views as reported <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> A, paras five and eight. We continue
                        to believe there will be need for continuing NATO consultation on Middle
                        East situation and that the proc-ess should begin with next week's
                        Ministerial meeting. Thus, at the meeting our aims will be (a) to establish
                        clearly the major interests of <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0611"/>NATO
                        countries in the immediate Middle East situation and in relation to
                        long-range stability and development of the area; (b) to obtain Ministerial
                        agreement, or at least informal understanding, re need for quiet continuing
                        NATO consultation on these problems; (c) to seek consensus on goals and
                        methods of such consultations. Aside from obvious, intrinsic importance of
                        Middle East problems, NATO consultations would represent major practical
                        supplement to efforts underway in Future of Alliance Study.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Re NATO interests in the Middle East</hi>: Although many
                        of these are obvious, believe it useful for Ministerial discussion to
                        establish a clear record on this point. Consequently, recalling the
                        Secretary's emphasis on dangers of Middle East situation last December, we
                        would expect to bring out such points as the following. These take on added
                        urgency in light of current crisis:</p>
                    <p>A. Geographical proximity to NATO area.</p>
                    <p>B. Consequent vital European and North American interest in peace, stability
                        and regional development in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>C. Strategic elements in relation to NATO area such as sea communications,
                        overflight privileges, and petroleum resources.</p>
                    <p>D. Importance of the Mediterranean to the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>E. Arms supply problems and the need to find means of avoiding future
                        competitive arms buildups.</p>
                    <p>F. The link between foregoing points and Western relations with the Soviet
                        Union. We recognize that East-West relations may be a good starting point to
                        lead into questions of NATO's interest in the Middle East. Point we wish to
                        get across, however, is that there are also other important reasons for
                        Western concern with the area.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Re need, goals and methods for consultations</hi>: NATO
                        as an institution should have no action role vis-a-vis the Middle East. Such
                        a role would be undesirable in East-West context; in terms of
                        responsibilities of other bodies (notably <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>); and in terms of Arab and “third world” attitude toward NATO
                        and its members. This circumstance in no way detracts from need we see for
                        close Western coordination on positions NATO countries will be taking in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and bilaterally with third parties. At
                        same time, all of above factors highlight need for maximum secrecy re fact
                        and substance of NATO consultations on Middle East.</p>
                    <p>4. An analogy can be made with NATO consultations on disarmament problems
                        where the negotiating forum is the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.
                        Arrangements for continuing discussions on Middle East in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> can create basis of support for Western
                        positions at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They can help assure
                        full understanding of the interests of individual Alliance members and
                        reduce risks that any of them might be working at cross purposes. Also,
                        should a future crisis occur, NATO machinery would already be tuned up and
                        could be used quickly if desired. Events of past few weeks have <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0612"/>shown that, once crisis is upon us, it is
                        too late to try and crank up special machinery for Alliance
                        consultations.</p>
                    <p>5. As to the arrangements themselves, we have concluded that we should
                        probably not seek agreement on creation of special group with formal terms
                        of reference now. Desirability and possibility of such a step can be
                        examined later. Rather, we lean toward your idea (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> A, para eight) of urgent ad hoc consultations in
                        framework of Permanent Council. This would presumably take care of
                        chairmanship problem automatically; i.e., <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> would preside. We do however attach importance to two
                        elements: (a) understanding that participation is open-ended in sense that
                        others can go ahead even if some countries should not wish to attend; and
                        (b) policy-level officials from capitals can attend as necessary.</p>
                    <p>6. As we see it, foregoing approach would have several advantages. It reduces
                        negotiating difficulties and time that would be required in attempting to
                        get agreement on formal group, whether embracing full NATO membership or
                        not. Keeping matter in framework of Permanent Council should help in
                        reducing publicity as we have succeeded in doing with periodic <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> discussions.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Re tactics</hi>: We would prefer that Brosio or some
                        other national delegation sponsor proposal along foregoing lines. If this
                        cannot be arranged in time available, however, you should indicate our
                        intention to make the proposal. In any case, you may expose our views on
                        basis this telegram. Appreciate your urgent recommendations for US tactics

                    <p>The Secretary congratulated M. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> on
                        his selection as President of the new Commission of the European Communities
                        and congratulated him on his efforts to achieve a really successful Kennedy
                        Round. He said the U.S. was pleased with the outcome though undoubtedly
                        there would be “guerilla” attacks by protectionists and special pleaders on
                        some aspects of the settlement. He added that the political consequences of
                        a failure would have been catastrophic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> agreed and said protectionist
                        forces would have gained the upper hand and undone all that has been
                        accomplished in freeing world trade and economic growth.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed and said protectionist forces will seek to prevent
                        further movement in trade liberalization. He explained that President
                        Kennedy had sought the <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss> on the ground
                        that just to get the Trade Agreement Act renewed was such a fight so why not
                        have the fight and get legislation which it appeared more worthwhile to seek
                        legislation which was much more significant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said he realized we would have a
                        fight on the Hill over ASP and therefore the Community had told its people
                        and industries to keep quiet and not agitate the matter. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said the farm lobby pressures in the
                        Community had great political impact but would be reduced in his opinion as
                        the modernization of agriculture proceeded to oblige more and more farmers
                        to leave the land.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that we had strong pressures from the Hill on many
                        matters. He explained that for the first time we had trouble on NATO as a
                        result of the Mansfield Resolution backed by the Democratic Policy Committee
                        to withdraw troops from Europe. This was now stopped but the onslaught had
                        occurred because of our extensive commitments in Vietnam and concern that
                        there was a double standard in NATO on defense contributions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> commented that Europe needs to
                        have a more united view to present in partnership to the United States.
                        French behaviour has damaged NATO and Atlantic cooperation but he was
                        confident this was temporary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said Europe should become more outward looking and play more of
                        a world role.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> replied that had the Community not
                        been preoccupied with its internal problems, it could have played a role in
                        seeking to improve Arab-Israeli relations. It has the means. If it could
                        only advance toward <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0614"/>political
                        unity, its world role and responsibilities would be enhanced. He hoped that
                        now that the Community has resolved many major internal problems, it will
                        increasingly take a responsible outward looking role.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, he said we needed a common position for <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> II on trade with <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled the President's Punta del Este statement<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">For text of this statement, April 12, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>,
                                1967</hi>, pp. 444–446.</note> and said, “We've moved.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> replied that the Commission would
                        make a general preferences system proposal to the Council of Ministers in
                        the fall. He thought we could achieve a “rapprochement” of positions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that it took a lot of consultation on the Hill before
                        this statement could be made and explained U.S. Constitutional
                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and the
                        safeguards issue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said he was not familiar with the
                        details. He planned to see Chairman Seaborg in the morning.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the UK would get into the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said “yes.” The French were
                        pursuing delaying tactics. In his opinion, they were not prepared to stop
                        negotiations. He expected that the procedure under Article 237 of the Rome
                        Treaty would be followed. If the advice of the Commission is requested as
                        provided for, the Commission will undoubtedly take the position that it must
                        talk to the British. He guessed the Council would approve and doubted they
                        would veto.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the U.S. should remain publicly silent on this matter.
                        M. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> responded with an emphatic
                        “yes.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> might at some point “cock his snoot” at the U.S. for
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s consumption.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> thought he might but commented
                        that more and more high level political figures in France realize one cannot
                        say unite Europe and then pursue divisive policies. He said the General was
                        really showing signs of age and his Ministers in many cases were already
                        thinking differently and looking toward their political futures. The
                        evolution of French policy was interesting. In 1964, France tried to destroy
                        the Community. Now it is playing the game. At the time of the Dillon Round,
                        the General saw <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> on television and
                        is reported to have said, “Who is that man who speaks in the name of
                        France?” At the Rome Summit, he said, “Congratulations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, you have succeeded.” He added that
                        French cooperation in the last days of the Kennedy Round negotiation was
                        striking.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. After two days reflection, post audit of all reporting cables, and a talk
                        with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, I think the most striking
                        thing about the NATO Ministerial Meeting in Luxembourg was that for first
                        time in two years Ministers did not need to spend most of their time gluing
                        NATO together. Government delegations and attending journalists alike seemed
                        to assume that NATO is here to stay. So diplomats were not talking and
                        journalists were not writing about collapse, anemia, demise or disarray.
                        Instead, they were able to concentrate on major issues of foreign policy in
                        which allies share common interests—though not common opinions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mid East Crisis and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The Mid East crisis of course dominated both private discussions and
                        public briefings. There seemed no doubt in anyone's mind that NATO Ministers
                        should be discussing Middle East crisis, and that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should continue to consult about it. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s summation made clear distinction
                        between action in US and bilateral channels, and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as the “place where allies should consult among
                        themselves”. Even if some members do not intend to reach common policy, he
                        said, there should be as much consensus as possible in an attempt to avoid
                        “open conflict”. Secretary's emphasis on possibility of different allies
                        being useful to Middle East peace-making in different ways (e.g., some with
                        Israeli, some with some Arabs, some with other Arabs, some with Soviets) was
                        well received and even drew an endorsement from <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Ministers' diagnoses of origins Middle East conflict were strikingly
                        similar. There was clear consensus that <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U
                            Thant</persName> had acted rashly and unwisely, and had helped bring on
                        conflict; that while Israeli military victory was only the beginning of
                        extremely difficult problems, <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0616"/>these
                        problems were not a patch on the problems that would have been created for
                        most allied governments if the fighting had gone the other way; that
                        domestic opinion in NATO countries greatly favored Israel; and the Soviet
                        miscalculation was enormous in providing sophisticated machines without
                        developing the sophisticated military men to use them. No one at Luxembourg
                        thought anything but loud noise would come out of an emergency session of
                        the General Assembly, but there was grudging admiration for Soviet tactical
                        skill in selecting a forum in which they could embarrass Western nations
                        while they themselves could look as if they were doing something big for
                        their Arab friends.</p>
                    <p>4. But when Ministers moved beyond diagnosis to prescription, the consensus
                        was limited to agreement that their representatives should keep consulting.
                        Even on approach to the emergency General Assembly, skepticism about what
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could accomplish did not prevent
                        governments as varied in their basic opinions as France, Portugal and
                        Denmark from predicting they would have to vote for convening of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> (Luxembourg 492).<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">Dated June 14. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            NATO 3 LUX(LU))</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. A recurring theme at Luxembourg was the threat of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s peacekeeping function which seems inherent in <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>'s action on <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>. Canadians and Danes, who are traditionally most reluctant
                        to be seen consulting NATO allies on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        problems, were clearly troubled by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s
                        peacekeeping potential, willing to discuss it quite frankly, and (along with
                        Greeks and Turks) anxious to get allies' endorsement of continuing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Cyprus. Fate of <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> has clearly been a real jolt to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s best friends and supporters in the West,
                        with full effect not yet predictable. Franco Nogueira (Portugal) of course
                        tried to convert this disillusionment into a general vote of no confidence
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as peacekeeping agency, but
                        tactical result was only to rally other Ministers to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support faute de mieux.</p>
                    <p>6. Everybody (including French) regard the old “France-NATO” issue as a thing
                        of the past. All comments on NATO defense matters reflected satisfaction
                        with the organization's success in growing past the crisis of French
                        withdrawal, institutionalizing Les Quatorze, and moving rapidly to develop
                        modern force plans, nuclear strategies, and crisis management techniques.
                        But on the political side, this Luxembourg meeting provided the first
                        important test of what French Government means by staying in the Alliance
                        while withdrawing from NATO. Evidently it means exchanging views with allies
                        but avoiding both the reality and the appearance of common Western actions
                        or policies.</p>

                            June 14. (Ibid.)</note> to communique language on the Middle East which
                        all other members (and French representatives <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0617"/>in communique drafting committee) regarded as
                        unexceptionable, could have provoked a kind of constitutional cirisis about
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultation, if we had carried it
                        that far. When he left Luxembourg before communique session, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> left in the French chair
                        an instructed delegate with no authority to negotiate the disputed language.
                        It was a hard and uncomfortable row for <persName corresp="#p_DGJC1">Jean de
                            la Grandville</persName> to hoe. He had the unenviable assignment of
                        explaining why the French Government would not agree to say that all NATO
                        allies “seek good relations with all countries of the Middle East”. The
                        reason this inoffensive morsel stuck in the French Minister's craw was
                        apparently his unwillingness to associate French efforts to woo Middle
                        Eastern countries with parallel efforts of others, notably US and UK, with
                        whom some Arab countries have just ruptured relations. But French
                        representative could not very well say this, and his resulting efforts to
                        skirt the issue yet stay with the instructed position made for a sticky hour
                        and a half of debate.</p>
                    <p>8. French position on this seems however to be in line with “independent”
                        position French were taking in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                        Petroleum Committee last week, with French behavior re special <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve
                            de Murville</persName>'s speech to National Assembly June 15 (reported
                        by Embassy in Paris 20240),5 with the more or less embargo of arms to
                        Israel, and in general with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s pursuit of “disinterested path” (Paris 20242)<note n="5" xml:id="d258fn5">Dated June 15. (Ibid., POL 27 ARAB–ISR)</note> in
                        Middle East crisis. French unwillingness to be associated with anything that
                        looked like a common policy, even an inoffensive one, was carried to the
                        point of risking a break in Ministerial <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>;
                        toward the end of the marathon communique session June 14, French Delegation
                        checked with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> in Paris and
                        received instructions to stick to the position even if that meant the
                        session had to adjourn without an agreed communique.</p>
                    <p>9. French intransigeance and unwillingness even to discuss compromise
                        language incensed other delegations, though everybody was rigidly polite,
                        and most of the remaining Ministers (<persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Paul
                            Martin</persName> was a notable exception) remained on the sidelines.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was and still is furious.
                        We pressed <persName corresp="#p_DGJC1">De la Grandville</persName> far
                        enough to reveal the full enormity of French position; the process was not
                        without its entertaining moments, as when we suggested simply footnoting a
                        French objection to the sentence about allies seeking good relations with
                        all Middle East countries. Eventually, because issue was non-negotiable, we
                        stopped negotiating and accepted a Fanfani “compromise” which removed the
                        offending sentence. Thereafter a number of Ministers who had been silent
                        came over to thank us for pressing the issue, and to express their shock and
                        dismay at what the little debate had revealed about French willingness to
                        withdraw in practice even from political side of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0618"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> (Denmark), [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] was particularly
                        vociferous to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and myself
                        afterwards in denouncing the French position and tactics.</p>
                    <p>10. At last December's Ministerial Meeting <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> carefully avoided drawing this kind of issue on a
                        question of political consultation (the East-West relations reports).
                        Incident at Luxembourg meeting must therefore be seen as first substantial
                        skirmish on the new NATO-France issue, about the nature and outcome of
                        political consultation in the Council.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Non-Proliferation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>11. Discussion of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was carried on in
                        “private meeting” of Ministers, which meant that only 50 people were
                        present. Discussion at that meeting, and Fanfani's comments at luncheon
                        afterwards (Paris 20212)<note n="6" xml:id="d258fn6">Dated June 15. (Ibid.,
                            NATO 3 LUX(LU))</note> seem to indicate some change in the atmosphere
                        about <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Italian and German Ministers both
                        were at pains to emphasize support, not only for principle of
                        non-proliferation, but for a treaty. Neither <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName>
                        mentioned the idea of limited duration for an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>; and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> put his
                        main stress on the balance of obligations—an issue which, like the earlier
                        German concern about discrimination in peaceful nuclear development, should
                        be readily negotiable.</p>
                    <p>12. From public and private comments by several Ministers, it is clear that
                        Middle East war has forced everybody to think hard about non-European
                        reasons for <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We heard other delegations
                        repeating Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s speculation
                        whether losing side in such a regional war could be expected to accept
                        defeat without using nuclear weapons if it had any; and <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George Brown</persName> made essentially the same point
                        in his press briefings.</p>
                    <p>13. Without trying to predict outcome of rough passage still ahead on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, it certainly seems that our investment in
                        patient and extended bilateral and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>

                    <p>14. The forecast in Paris 20055,<note n="7" xml:id="d258fn7">Dated June 9.
                            (Ibid.)</note> that Western disappointments, Soviet hardening, and
                        Soviet role in Mid East would sober the more avid East-West detente buffs,
                        was borne out in Ministerial statements at Luxembourg. There is still quite
                        a wide spectrum of opinion, with Scandinavians, <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0619"/>Canadians and British most hopeful that Soviets want peace
                        and Germans, Dutch and Greeks most skeptical. But the whole spectrum has
                        discernibly moved over toward pessimism about Soviet motivations, so that
                        those Ministers who spoke of detente in hopeful manner felt constrained to
                        balance their comments with emphasis on maintaining the NATO deterrent as
                        well. Even the French, whose official line has been that detente was so
                        obvious that integrated Western military strength is no longer relevant,
                        have taken to endorsing Western defensive strength for its role in
                        encouraging Soviets to co-exist peacefully in Europe.</p>
                    <p>15. Against this background, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s
                        speech to the North Atlantic Council raised the steadiest voice of any
                        European Minister. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, he said, would
                        persist in a policy of gradual rapprochement with the East. Highlights of
                        his contribution to the meeting were announcement of <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s letter to Stopf;<note n="8" xml:id="d258fn8">On June 14, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> rejected Premier Willi Stoph's invitation for
                            talks in East Berlin.</note> his embracing of US terminology by calling
                        for NATO to pay attention not only to crisis management but to “management
                        of detente”; and his successful effort to have Council declare itself
                        against discrimination among allies in moving toward detente. Latter point
                        was another that provoked argument with French in final communique session
                        but French eventually accepted a formulation in which Council did not come
                        out against “discrimination” in detente but instead “recorded its view that
                        the detente should be extended for the benefit of all members of the
                        Alliance.”</p>
                    <p>16. On the whole, therefore, the idea that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should use consultation to keep track of political contacts
                        and coordinate so far as possible policies of member countries in improving
                        East-West relations, an idea that seemed quite exotic to some a year ago, is
                        now rather widely accepted—though with obvious mental reservations as far as
                        France is concerned. And the increased realism about the Soviet military
                        threat and political intransigeance should make it less difficult to fashion
                        allied approaches to East-West relations that stay one clear step ahead of
                        the Soviets on the road toward European settlement, without getting
                        sentimental about it.</p>

                        The striking thing about this exercise is that when governments had to think
                        deeper and harder about the nature of the problem, they stopped talking
                        about <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0620"/>what America should do to
                        expiate its guilt for being ahead, and started talking sense about what

                        wide-ranging review; but they also tended to define more explicitly the
                        basic assumptions on which the subgroups are already working—that the
                        Alliance needs to maintain credible deterrent for the indefinite future;
                        that the process of detente cannot safely be left to individual Western
                        initiatives and Soviet divisive tactics; that NATO must be deeply concerned,
                        though in a non-operational fashion, about situations outside NATO defense
                        areas such; and that broader and franker and more intimate political
                        consultation is always part of the mix of actions required to pursue and
                        protect the common interests of NATO allies.<note n="10" xml:id="d258fn10">In circular telegram 212575, June 19, the Department of State commented

                    <p>Dear Adam:</p>
                    <p>I have delayed a reply to your letter of June 14, 1967<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">Not found.</note> not only because of some well-known
                        international events, but also because I wanted to give careful
                        consideration to the points which you raised. We are just beginning to work
                        on my report,<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and Watson were
                            rapporteurs for two of the groups working on various aspects of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study.</note> and some
                        of these views are quite preliminary. Thus, I think it will be useful to
                        continue to exchange views with you and others over the coming weeks.</p>
                    <p>Inevitably your report is going to have a somewhat different focus than mine.
                        I will be concerned primarily with defense problems and with the medium
                        term—that is the period in which we will be hoping for forward movement in
                        East-West relations, but not expecting any fundamental changes in Soviet
                        policy and in European security arrangements. I assume that your report will
                        be concerned more with political strategy and actions and also will consider
                        longer-term policies. Nevertheless, I agree there will be much common ground
                        covered, and it will be useful for us to know what assumptions the other is
                        making.</p>
                    <p>I agree with a great deal of what you say in your letter. Certainly one of
                        the principal changes in the relations of the Alliance with Eastern Europe
                        in recent years is a <hi rend="italic">limited</hi> and rather selective
                        relaxation of tensions. Despite this trend, I fully agree that relationships
                        with the East will <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0622"/>not be easy in
                        the next few years. We can expect new relationships to develop slowly and
                        unevenly. However, we must expect more diplomatic contacts between East and
                        West than we have had in the past, and for this reason, I agree that we
                        should do what we can in NATO to assure that members are fully cognizant of
                        the impact on the security and political cohesion of Western Europe, of the
                        progressive effects of these contacts and thus, where possible we should
                        coordinate our efforts.</p>
                    <p>I also agree with you that the existing NATO machinery and the practice which
                        we have had already in consultation in NATO provides an asset on which we
                        can build. It is important that bilateral contacts with the Soviet Union and
                        Eastern Europe be supplemented by multilateral exchanges within NATO which
                        will give all of the members of the Alliance an over-all picture of where we
                        stand in our relationships with the East.</p>
                    <p>While NATO has a significant role to play, there will be limits on how far it
                        will be possible and desirable to coordinate East-West contacts in NATO. It
                        will be more important (and also more difficult) to coordinate some actions
                        than it will others. I see no way of defining theses limits precisely in
                        advance, but we should be able to establish some benchmarks. I hope that you
                        plan to consider in your study what actions will be particularly important
                        to coordinate, and what the feasible limits may be on consultation about
                        East-West contacts. For our part, we are prepared to engage fully in such
                        consultation, and hope that others will take a similar view.</p>
                    <p>While I do not think we disagree on the military importance of the Alliance
                        and the continued role of deterrence, I would give this somewhat greater
                        emphasis than you do. It seems to me that the maintenance of an adequate
                        deterrent remains fundamental to our relationships with the Communist states
                        of Europe. Whatever progress we have made toward relaxation of tensions has
                        been in large measure a result of the fact that the Soviets have concluded
                        that military pressures will not serve their ends in Western Europe. They
                        have reached this conclusion because the West has maintained adequate
                        military strength and political cohesion and the two go together in my view.
                        I believe that maintenance of an effective deterrent continues to be
                        essential as we gradually develop new relationships with the USSR and the
                        states of Eastern Europe. And I am concerned that this may be forgotten as
                        NATO inevitably moves toward greater emphasis on developing relationships
                        with the East.</p>
                    <p>Even now, there seem to be dangerous, albeit understandable, tendencies to
                        weaken our military forces. I am particularly concerned by the pressures to
                        reduce the non-nuclear forces of the Alliance at a time when the Soviets are
                        building up their strategic capabilities at a rapid rate. While we do not
                        yet fully understand the potential implications of emerging strategic
                        parity, I think it behooves us to maintain and improve <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0623"/>our present non-nuclear capabilities until
                        we do understand these implications more fully. For this reason, I have
                        included, as one of the central themes of my report, a discussion of the
                        relationship between deterrence and detente.</p>
                    <p>I think that it is important to try to set forth in the report just what
                        detente is all about, what it means to NATO, and what we can expect in the
                        future. While I agree that we should not attempt a “Webster definition” of
                        detente, I think we should try to set forth as explicitly as possible what
                        we believe to be the Soviet objectives with respect to detente and what our
                        own attitudes should be. Certainly the respective objectives of East and
                        West continue to be fundamentally different. It also is quite clear that
                        different members of the Alliance have different views of what detente
                        means. For example, some of our allies, while wishing to extend their own
                        relationships with Eastern Europe, are concerned by some of our dealings
                        with the Soviet Union, for example, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. While
                        there clearly will be differing views of detente, as each member of the
                        Alliance has a somewhat different perspective, unless we can have some
                        measure of agreement on what detente means, then I do not see how we can
                        devise any sort of a coordinated approach to our contacts with the East.</p>
                    <p>In my own view, the Soviets have in recent years come to see relaxation of
                        tensions as meeting their own national interests. They hope, by relaxing
                        tensions selectively, to weaken the cohesion of the Alliance, divide the
                        states of Western Europe, and in particular, to isolate the Federal Republic
                        and open up differences between Western Europe and the US. To some extent,
                        they have been successful in this policy. In my view, the long-term Soviet
                        objective is to reduce US influence in Western Europe and eventually remove
                        the US presence from the continent. They hope to convince us that NATO is no
                        longer relevant and that a US military presence in Western Europe is no
                        longer required. A recognition of these Soviet objectives does not mean that
                        we should abandon our efforts to improve East-West relationships. In fact,
                        detente provides opportunities for the West as well—important opportunities
                        to open the societies of Eastern Europe and weaken the influence of the
                        Soviets in these states; also to promote the evolutionary process inside the
                        Soviet Union itself.</p>
                    <p>With the above in mind, I intend that my report, in any event, will proceed
                        on the following assumptions:</p>
                    <p>1. Deterrence is still very much relevant to NATO. It requires a balanced mix
                        of nuclear and non-nuclear forces and continuing efforts to improve the
                        capabilities of these forces, particularly in view of rapidly changing
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>2. Quite aside from the need to deter, and NATO's role in this, I see a
                        continued long-term need for a strong coalition military force to
                        counterbalance Soviet military preponderance on the Continent. Without <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0624"/>such a counterbalancing force,
                        which NATO members would be unable to provide acting individually, Soviet
                        military superiority would be a source of political leverage and influence
                        for application in Western Europe. NATO neutralizes this important
                        potential. I consider this a vital function for the long run.</p>
                    <p>3. The present detente is limited. It involves risks as well as
                        opportunities. The Soviets have not abandoned their basic objectives. They
                        continue to seek means of dividing the members of the Alliance and removing
                        the US presence in Europe. They continue their bitter hostility to Germany
                        and their opposition to German unification on any basis that would be
                        acceptable to the West. At the present time, they see a purposeful and
                        selective relaxation of tensions as serving these objectives. Therefore,
                        while seeking to take advantage of the opportunities offered by an improving
                        East-West atmosphere, we must parry Soviet efforts to use detente for their
                        own ends.</p>
                    <p>4. There is a need for the NATO members to harmonize their approaches toward
                        Eastern Europe. We cannot expect to achieve, nor should we seek a monolithic
                        NATO policy toward East-West relationships, but at least we can expect NATO
                        to serve as a clearing house which will help to provide each member of the
                        Alliance with an over-all view of the state of East-West relationships, and
                        reduce the risks of the NATO governments working at cross purposes with each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>5. There is a need also to coordinate arms control and disarmament policies.
                        We should attempt to establish some agreement on the relative feasibility of
                        various arms control measures and the priorities we attach to pursuing
                        each.</p>
                    <p>6. NATO continues to be very much relevant to the current situation in
                        Europe. This is true for at least two reasons. First, because the
                        maintenance of a deterrent is still essential, and because deterrence
                        requires not only adequate military strength, but common objectives and
                        resolve. The deterrent can be weakened as readily by political differences
                        between the members of the Alliance as it can by reductions in the physical
                        capability of the forces. Secondly, NATO is relevant because, as contacts
                        between East and West expand and proliferate, we need even more than we have
                        before a forum in which we can exchange views and consult about specific
                        policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>7. Finally, while this is less directly relevant to defense policy, an
                        essential element for genuine and lasting accommodation and maximum
                        long-range change in the Soviet society is the economic strength, political
                        cohesion, and social progress of the Atlantic nations. The greater is our
                        progress and unity in the West, the more will the USSR (and Eastern Europe)
                        be drawn away from an anachronistic ideology toward genuine cooperation with
                        the West.</p>
                    <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0625"/>
                    <p>Security for the members of NATO has always been based on two fundamental
                        propositions. First, the maintenance of adequate military strength. Second,
                        a willingness to seek agreements with the East which would genuinely reduce
                        the risk of conflict. In the early years of NATO there were relatively few
                        opportunities for agreement. Therefore, the primary emphasis in the Alliance
                        was on the coordination of effective military strength. In recent years,
                        some opportunities have developed which have permitted the reduction of
                        tensions. This does not invalidate the need for military strength, but it
                        does force upon the NATO members the need to consider together opportunities
                        for reducing tensions and how we should deal with these opportunities. This
                        adds a new dimension to NATO's business.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that a principal task before the Alliance is to find better
                        means of consulting about the security issues that confront us. While our
                        principal objective remains the security of the North Atlantic area, this
                        now involves, to a greater extent, questions of political tactics and
                        actions as well as military issues. There is a greater risk of disagreement
                        amongst us because there are more choices to be made and greater room for
                        maneuver. In this environment, it seems to me that maintenance of the NATO
                        organization as a locus for consultation is more important than it has ever
                        been. I know of no better way to improve the procedures of consultation than
                        to use them more intensively. The existing institutions of NATO at least
                        provide the point of departure.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Last week I spent Friday and Saturday in Bonn to pursue the talks with the
                        Germans on European Security and East-West relations, as you and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> requested at the NATO
                        Luxembourg meeting.</p>
                    <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0626"/>
                    <p>While there, I had a chance to talk at some length with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>,
                        Schutz, Diehl, and Ruete of the Foreign Office, and with <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> Hillenbrand and others in our own
                        Embassy.</p>
                    <p>Since my return, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName> has
                        sent in a number of reports on the views of key figures which you have
                        doubtless seen. Hence, I will limit myself to interpretive comments:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">I. German Military Program</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>On the military budget, it was quite clear from <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> (as
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> has since reported that,
                        contrary to <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>, the Cabinet has
                        decided only on the military <hi rend="italic">budget</hi>, and has not cut
                        back from existing spending levels but in essence has adopted them as a
                        plateau until 1971 (the four percent average <hi rend="italic">increase</hi>
                        will about take care of salary raises and inflation).</p>
                    <p>The decision about how to adjust the future military program is still under
                        study. Aside from the budget, several other factors have opened the issue of
                        the size and structure for the Bundeswehr.</p>
                    <p>(1) Many German officials are convinced the U.S. is changing its military
                        posture in Europe. They think (a) our redeployment plan is only first stage
                        of cuts in our total strength, and (b) our aim is to take strategic nuclear
                        weapons out of Europe, leaving tactical weapons. Hence, they begin to ask
                        whether so many tactical nuclear weapons on their soil is a good idea. They
                        do not doubt the U.S. interest in keeping Europe from Soviet control but
                        wonder whether the U.S. is moving toward a strategy which would avoid direct
                        U.S.-USSR confrontation in any European war.</p>
                    <p>(2) They are genuinely concerned whether the present structure is the most
                        efficient set-up for using resources devoted to defense, in view of the high
                        cost and scarcity of specialists, and failure to utilize the large numbers
                        of trained people, without an adequate reserve system. Some are considering
                        whether they would not do better with a more professional cadre or core,
                        which would be supplemented by a better reserve system, able to mobilize in
                        four or five days.</p>
                    <p>(3) Another element in their thinking is much vaguer. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and others are wondering how to
                        relate changes in Western (and German) defense forces to East-West aims.
                        Should the Germans emphasize a defensive capacity as opposed to ability to
                        respond to attack by counter offensive? Would smaller forces contribute to
                        detente?</p>
                    <p>There are, of course, counter pressures. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> wants to maintain the present structure, if
                        possible, even if it means cuts in men rather than materiel. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> will probably try to keep present
                        force levels even at the expense of equipment because of nervousness about
                        U.S. reaction. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> will probably be
                        torn between the demands within NATO and the appeal of cuts of
                        welfare-oriented <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and for East-West
                        policy.</p>
                    <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0627"/>
                    <p>In my view, it is quite possible that some reshaping of the Bundes-wehr
                        toward a smaller highly trained force, with an efficient reserve system,
                        might actually improve the German contribution to flexible response. Hence
                        in resisting unwise cuts for political reasons, we should not inhibit a
                        serious review and possible revision which makes military sense.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">II. East-West Relations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The recent comments of <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> on the future status of
                        Germany between East and West do not reflect, I think, any concrete plan or
                        long-term policy Ruete said the Foreign Office knew of no specific basis for
                        them and was itself trying to get clarification. This does not mean
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> does not have ideas from
                        other sources.</p>
                    <p>I have the impression that this general area is much more confused in German
                        thinking than we may assume. Several people stressed that the German public
                        generally, and younger people in particular, are impatient on what they
                        consider to have been rigidity in past German policy, especially on East
                        Germany. Therefore, it is thought to be politically profitable to be or
                        appear more flexible and thinking new thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Thus, competition between the Coalition parties and even within them on
                        Eastern policy engenders movement. Yet none of the Germans I spoke to
                        thought there was any new or short route to unity, and much of the focus is
                        on “humanizing” relations with East Germany, and conditions within it. Thus,
                        present ferment and confusion seem likely to continue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stressed the link between
                        German unity and European unity. In a recent talk to a refugee convention,
                        he told them that a fragmented Europe will never permit Germany to be
                        reunited, and that anyone who says otherwise is misleading them. The
                        “classic” policy of France, Britain and Russia vis-a-vis Germany had been
                        that a united Germany would be out of proportion. In his view, only a
                        unified Western Europe would change the balance of forces and the classic
                        European approach to the German problem. British entry into the European
                        Community would serve this purpose and also give Germany more choices than
                        with only France.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had just been in Bonn when
                        I visited. He had been very gracious to Germans and even very bland about
                        the U.S. forces on the Continent. He had gone all out to oppose UK entry. If
                        the UK came into Europe, this would have dire consequences, in continued US
                        domination of Europe, in indefinite postponement of German unity, and in
                        radically changing the character of the European Community. To become
                        eligible in the long future, Britain would have to totally change its
                        traditions, outlook and commitments abroad (such as Hong Kong and
                        Singapore). <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">
                            <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>De Gaulle</persName> said he
                        had made these points to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>.
                        Though <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> made no comment, he was
                        thinking (<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said) that “after
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>” things would be
                        different. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> commented,
                        “Maybe so, but it isn't sure”.</p>
                    <p>This puts the Germans into an awkward spot. They don't want to jeopardize
                        their own relations with France or to break up the Community. Yet they
                        really would like to see Britain in, to add weight to Europe and provide
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">IV. Relations with U.S.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>On relations with the U.S., the Germans are also concerned (or confused); (a)
                        they suspect that the U.S. is pulling away from Europe (based on U.S. force
                        withdrawals, reducing strategic weapons, our relations with USSR, especially
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) and they must take account of this;
                        and (b) they want to put a little distance between themselves and U.S. for a
                        variety of reasons.</p>
                    <p>The Germans know their security depends on the U.S. umbrella. They are
                        satisfied we are committed to the defense of Europe. But they are uncertain
                        what kind of strategy we may be moving to. NATO as an integrated force and a
                        mechanism for policy coordination clearly seems shaky to them, but they do
                        not have proposals or ideas for improving it. They put more stress on
                        bilateral consultation and possibly stronger European ties—without knowing
                        how to achieve them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">V. Domestic Political Question</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The pressures to keep the Coalition together are pretty strong at this point,
                        as the budget crisis showed. The <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> feels
                        it is benefitting by having the Socialists to share some of the current onus
                        of unpopular decisions; <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> has
                        succeeded in grabbing credit for the more popular actions. The Socialists
                        have the unhappy feeling that the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is
                        getting more benefit out of the partnership than they. But they enjoy being
                        in office and some feel that the changes which have to be made can better be
                        made by both.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">VI. Conclusions</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) The ferment in German thinking seems certain to continue. The efforts to
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">foster</persName> evolution and better
                        relations with Eastern Europe (including East Germany and the USSR) are
                        likely to promote probing and attendant confusion at this stage. The
                        competition between the parties and political figures is likely to produce
                        comments and proposals which have not been thought out.</p>
                    <p>(2) Specific results are likely to be very sparse and slow. In Eastern
                        Europe, East Germany and the European Community, any constructive changes
                        will take substantial time. Hence, the Germans are likely to be <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0629"/>frustrated for some time. To some extent
                        this frustration is likely to be focused on us just because of our
                        predominant size and power.</p>
                    <p>(3) The German review of its defense structure could be constructive. One
                        result could be to improve the capacity of the German forces for
                        conventional response and perhaps reassure its Eastern neighbors somewhat.
                        But if made too fast or unilaterally, changes risk undermining NATO
                        collective defense and mutual trust.</p>
                    <p>(4) Hence, the concerting of Western policy, especially in the military field
                        and East-West relations, is of extreme importance so that any actions or
                        changes will be generally agreed and understood. To minimize distrust and
                        doubts, it is essential to consult candidly and frequently. The <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> visit can mainly serve this
                        purpose.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary asked if the Foreign Minister felt that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is preventing European
                        integration. Is Europe becoming isolationist?</p>
                    <p> Spuehler said that we have seen the French resist the entrance of Great
                        Britain into the Common Market and it will take time to admit Britain, but
                        Spuehler said that he feels that integration will go ahead. The <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0630"/>European Common Market is only one of the
                        problems involved in European integration. Switzerland is positive on this
                        subject, but can only maintain its position if it can preserve its
                        neutrality and safety.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we are concerned about a possible trend toward
                        isolationism in Europe. Isolationism in Europe would mean isolationism in
                        the United States. Scratch an American and you will find an isolationist, he
                        said. Our involvement in world affairs since World War II has been an act of
                        will contrary to the general sentiments of the American people. During the
                        last few months, while the United States has been engaged in Viet-Nam and
                        maintaining its forces in NATO, Great Britain has declared that she will
                        pull back from Southeast Asia in the 1970's, Germany is talking about
                        reduction of its defense budget, and no serious attention was paid in Europe
                        to the Arab-Israeli war, although the Near East is only 30 minutes away by
                        plane. Europe is also indifferent to events in Africa. The Secretary cited
                        the Congo as an example. The situation in the Congo meant possible danger to
                        most European governments, but only Switzerland and the United States acted
                        in the Congo, the Swiss through the International Committee of the Red
                        Cross. The United States sent three planes to the Congo to support the
                        central government. The Italian Government asked us to keep our planes there
                        to assist in the movement of Italian citizens. When we suggested that the
                        Italians should send their own planes, they said they would not do so. These
                        examples, the Secretary said, could be multiplied. European security and
                        prosperity have led to laziness. The Secretary said he is saying this
                        briefly and making perhaps an extreme case, but he wishes to make a
                        point—the United States are not mercenaries for the whole world as some
                        Europeans seem to think.</p>
                    <p> Spuehler said he understands the Secretary's viewpoint. The United States
                        are not mercenaries and are not going to be the policemen for the whole
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister noted that he sees a softening of alliances in the East
                        as well as the West. The Secretary replied that peace makes alliances
                        weaker. This is a natural development. But, he said, let us not forget that
                        five years ago Khrushchev threatened President Kennedy with war in Europe
                        over our position in Berlin. The countries of Eastern Europe have not been
                        converted, the Secretary said. Both sides have perhaps become more prudent,
                        especially since the Cuban missile crisis. The Secretary said he is not
                        bothered by the slackening of alliances as long as they are available in
                        time of crisis.</p>
                    <p>Some Europeans think that they can stand between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union. They believe that Europe is an innocent bystander in the
                        Moscow-Washington struggle. These Europeans feel that, if Europe could pull
                        out, the issue would become one between Moscow and Washington only. But
                        Europe is not an innocent bystander, <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0631"/>because Europe is the issue. The United States is not going to fight the
                        Soviet Union over polar bears in the Arctic; the safety of Europe is the
                        issue. Europe is not a third world; it is the main problem.</p>
                    <p> Spuehler said he shares the Secretary's views. Europe, he said, could never
                        stand up against the Soviet Union without U.S. backing, and this is the
                        thinking in Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that the United States for 20 years has been a
                        minority of one in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> which has been
                        attempting to limit trade in strategic commodities with Communist countries.
                        Now that we have agreed to expand our trade with Eastern Europe, the Western
                        Europeans say that we have entered into a conspiracy with Moscow. Our
                        Eastern European trade is insignificant. Twenty-six percent of Eastern
                        European trade is with Western Europe, and only 1.6 per cent is with the
                        United States. But the Administration's legislation to improve U.S. trade
                        with Eastern Europe is seen as part of this conspiracy, when all we are
                        doing is following the West European example.</p>
                    <p> Spuehler asked if the United States would support greater trade with Eastern
                        Europe. The Secretary replied that we have no objection to this. He observed
                        that some of Western Europe's objections to our attempts to increase trade
                        comes from a reluctance to face U.S. competition in Eastern Europe.</p>

                        and so did he. The last sixty days, in addition to the budget problem, had
                        called for a number of critical decisions. Among them had been the railroad
                        strike for which it had been necessary to pass legislation that was
                        upsetting “the labor people”. The Middle East crisis had developed suddenly
                        and it had been very difficult to obtain a cease fire but at least a
                        temporary solution had now been found. Then Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, without any forewarning, had
                        decided to see him. He had not wanted to go to New York because of the
                        presence of people at the United Nations from communist countries, Arab
                        countries and Africa, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        had not wanted to come to Washington.</p>
                    <p>We then agreed to meet in Glassboro. He said the Chairman and he had
                        discussed primarily the Viet-Nam problem. He believed that the Soviets would
                        have liked to see the matter settled but it seemed they did not have
                        sufficient “horse power” or influence to bring to bear on Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>They also had talked in some detail about the situation in Venezuela where
                        some communist agitators had been captured. They had a “straight” talk on
                        the matter and he found the attitude shown by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> “quite satisfactory”.</p>
                    <p>They had talked about avoiding the establishment of an antiballistic system
                        which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had agreed to talk about this
                        matter but no date was set.</p>
                    <p>He had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to table
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> without Article III. He could not
                        get an agreement on this at that time but this week it looked as if the
                        Soviets were ready to proceed on this matter. The Soviets had informed us at
                        5:30 a.m. that they were ready to table the draft leaving Article III blank
                        and leave the discussions on that Article to the future developments. He
                        believed this would actually happen this week or next. He did not really
                        know why they suddenly showed this willingness; maybe they looked for some
                        positive result for their 50th anniversary; maybe they wanted to make up for
                        their flop at the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>After the hectic Middle East discussion at the United Nations there had been
                        a disturbance in the Congo. He had sent over three planes mainly with the
                        thought in mind to have them ready in case it was necessary to evacuate
                        Americans in that area and if this was not necessary to help the established
                        government in their efforts to put down the rebellion. This was the first
                        time the United States had intervened on behalf of a black government. For
                        that reason he considered this an important move which, however, had brought
                        about some consternation on the domestic scene.</p>
                    <p>This was followed by the race riots in Detroit and other cities. They had not
                        been as bad as similar riots in India, Latin America and other <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0633"/>parts of the world but had been very
                        unusual for our country. President Roosevelt had had the same problem during
                        his administration.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned to the budget situation. He explained in detail the
                        components that added up to a total deficit of about $30 billion. In that
                        context he mentioned General Westmoreland would need about 200,000 more men
                        in Viet-Nam, as he thought that now was a good opportunity to “try to wind
                        up this thing.” Sixty-five thousand of those will be supplied by South
                        Viet-Nam, 45,000 by us and the rest by the Koreans and the other allies.
                        However the United States would have to pay for almost all of them. He said
                        he was trying to cover the deficit by borrowing about one-half of it,
                        cutting the deficit part of the expenditures by one-fourth and raise the
                        other one-fourth by means of a surtax. If he would have to go into the
                        capital market to borrow all of it, it might drive interest rates up as high
                        as 12 percent and cause a dangerous inflationary spiral. This was a time
                        when cities and other public authorities were borrowing heavily for all
                        sorts of projects which had put an additional strain on the capital market.
                        He hoped he could avoid that situation. However, some votes in congressional
                        committees had not come out in his favor.</p>
                    <p>His financial problems were compounded by the fact that his public opinion
                        poll showed him at an all-time low of 39 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor told the President not to be too concerned about the public
                        opinion polls. Polls in his country about the popularity of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Party generally showed a low about one year
                        before any election, but they had always won the elections.</p>
                    <p>The President replied he found the Chancellor's remarks very encouraging but
                        he still preferred to see a more favorable poll. He did not think that he
                        had made any major political mistakes, but there were groups inside his
                        Party and others that had different views on matters like Viet-Nam and he
                        has not been able so far to make them go along with his opinion.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that he would keep the Chancellor fully informed, as
                        he had done in the past with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, on all U.S. activities around the world that could
                        significantly affect the world power structure. He could not repeat that
                        often enough. He was willing to talk about the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in detail and listen to any suggestions that the Chancellor
                        might have in the matter. With regard to the troop level he could promise
                        the Chancellor that he would do anything in his power to hold the line if
                        the Chancellor would do the same. He would not ask any favor of the
                        Chancellor that he would not readily grant himself. After the visit of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and his visit to Bonn he
                        had allayed domestic fears on Germany. Then had come from Bonn the leak
                        about troop cuts and it had led to a severe reaction in the Congress which
                        had taken revenge by such actions as a substantial cut in his foreign aid
                        request.</p>
                    <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0634"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor told the President that he tried to keep up with events in the
                        United States. He was fully aware of the President's domestic problems. He
                        could not see where the President had made any major political mistakes that
                        might account for his low rating in the polls. He believed that whenever a
                        nation was plunged into a serious crisis people were quite ready to follow
                        and support the Government's policy in the beginning but after some time and
                        after the real difficulty became apparent and people could not see the end
                        or a satisfactory solution in sight people had a tendency to get nervous and
                        discouraged. This is why he had been so angry by the remark by Defense
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would have to cut their Armed Forces by
                        60,000 men. This simply was not true. It had never been considered by him or
                        his government.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then explained that the proposed cuts were only in planned
                        increased defense spending. In fact military spending would still go up by
                        1.1 per cent in 1968, by 7.5 per cent in 1969 and by 6 per cent in 1970. He
                        then explained his attempt to introduce a “medium term” financial plan
                        covering a five year period. He also explained that this year's reduction in
                        defense expenditure planning was not just a result of economic reasoning,
                        but that the top military men had tried for a long time to achieve more
                        “realistic planning” in the Defense Ministry. They felt that the planning of
                        the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> exceeded what they could hope to get
                        allocated in the national budget. They finally had agreed on the
                        modification of planning just two weeks before the fall of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> Government. In his talks with Defense
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> last week they had
                        decided that if a cut in personnel (the Chancellor did not specify here
                        whether military or civilian) had to be made it would not exceed 15,000.
                        This decision would only be made later in the course of the year. He
                        personally would hope there would not be need for any cuts at all.</p>
                    <p>The President replied he believed that force levels should be maintained if
                        at all possible. Europe would need all the military forces at its command in
                        order to remain secure during the uncertain period that lay ahead. He would
                        do anything in his power to preserve the strength of the Alliance. He did
                        not want to be the architect of the dismantling of the Alliance. He would
                        hold the line if <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> could hold
                        the line, but if the Chancellor had to make a reduction he would be forced
                        to make a proportionate reduction in the face of pressure from public
                        opinion and from the Congress. They would have to stand arm in arm.</p>
                    <p>The President complimented the Chancellor on his skillful handling of the
                        improvement of relationships with East European countries. He believed the
                        Chancellor was moving in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>The President then repeated with great emphasis that all available forces
                        were needed to guarantee the security of the Alliance and that every effort
                        should be made to retain the present strength.</p>
                    <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0635"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor said it was his view and that of his government to strive to
                        maintain the present strength of the armed forces. He also believed that
                        this was important to the security of the Alliance. Keeping up the necessary
                        strength was not in any way in conflict with the policy of detente and the
                        pursuit of peace. However, one would have to be careful not to confront the
                        two military apparatuses facing each other with additional political
                        tension, as this could lead to an eventual explosion. While keeping the
                        military balance on the same level one should instead try to decrease the
                        tension and keep it as low as possible. News media and some people had made
                        it appear as if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy was one of
                        aiming at the reduction of force levels; this was far from the truth.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that if the members of the House and the Senate
                        were asked by how much they thought <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> was trying to cut his armed forces, about 90 per
                        cent of them would say by 60,000 men. The President then dwelt in some
                        detail on the problems posed by inaccurate or slanted reporting in the news
                        media as well as differences in language and national customs. He quoted as
                        an example some misinterpreted statements of Prime Minister Ky that had
                        appeared on television and in the press. He said that just one misunderstood
                        word often could distort the picture significantly. In the light of this it
                        was all the more important that the men at the top had complete trust and
                        confidence in one another and that they would not do anything that would
                        affect the position of the other without frank and full consultation. It
                        should be the same kind of process as between two brothers running a
                        business jointly. He believed this was the best way for the two men to work
                        together. Did the Chancellor agree to that?</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied the President could be assured of that. He could also
                        be assured that what he had just told him about defense matters was true and
                        correct.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor cited a public opinion poll taken in Germany which showed that
                        the percentage of people there favoring closer cooperation between Germany
                        and the United States had risen from 42 per cent in January of this year to
                        71 per cent in June of this year.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then spoke about the Franco-German relationship. He said it
                        was almost a miracle that after centuries of warring and fighting with each
                        other a Franco-German friendship had been established. He was trying to
                        continue the course begun by Schumann and <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>During his recent talks with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> in Bonn he had tried to provoke the General into a
                        clear statement of his views on the United States. He had found them less
                        harsh than expected on some counts. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had said publicly during his visit and emphasized even
                        more strongly in private that he believed that it was useful to maintain the
                        present military strength and that the United States and France had been
                        connected by a long and natural friendship. France wanted to preserve <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0636"/>that friendship and wanted to
                        preserve the Western Alliance at least until such time as the relationship
                        with the Soviet Union had completely changed. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> also said publicly that he would not object to the
                        physical presence of U.S. forces on German soil and had added privately that
                        not only would he not object to them but he found their presence desirable.
                        (The Chancellor said he hoped he was not committing any breach of confidence
                        by relating this private remark to the President.)</p>
                    <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s question
                        why <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was using such harsh
                        language about the United States the General had answered that this was not
                        so much directed against the United States but was addressed to the French
                        people to exhort them not to give up their French identity for a life of
                        comfort in the Atlantic Community.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor remarked that he would interpret the remark of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> “until the relationship to the
                        Soviet Union had completely changed” to mean that he would not leave the
                        Alliance in 1969, as it was not likely that a complete change could occur by
                        that time.</p>
                    <p>On the question of British entry into the Common Market he had found
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to be “stubborn”. He
                        did not believe that much of a change had taken place in his attitude on the
                        matter but maybe in the long run public opinion and other pressures would
                        bring him around to reconsider his position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> also had told him that he
                        believed that the only danger from the Soviet Union was a military danger.
                        He did not think that the communists in the countries west of the Soviet
                        Union were any longer true allies of the Soviet Union. The Chancellor made
                        clear that he did not share this view, and the President said he did not
                        either.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated that he thought the Soviet Union, though not talking
                        much about China, was thinking about the problem of China all the time. The
                        President agreed with this view.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor repeated that he thought <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s attitude during their last meeting had been more
                        relaxed than during their meeting in January. He had seemed to acknowledge
                        the existence of differences between the two men rather than to balk at them
                        as he had done in the past. He had ended their conversation by telling the
                        Chancellor a story about two men that had gone out to hunt for a treasure.
                        After a long journey, hardship and disappointment they finally had to give
                        up their attempts without finding the treasure. Instead, however, they had
                        found a much more valuable treasure: friendship and understanding.</p>
                    <p>The President thanked the Chancellor for his comment on General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He said he was impressed by the
                        progress and stabilization achieved in France under the General's
                        leadership. This stability had had a good influence on the rest of the
                        world. He did not quite know why <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> sometimes found it desirable to use such sharp
                        language. Maybe by age he still felt more closely attached to another era,
                        the era of Church-ill <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0637"/>and
                        Roosevelt, and maybe he remembered too much the attitudes of President
                        Kennedy and Macmillan toward him. As far as the President was concerned he
                        made a policy of consciously refraining from negative statements about
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Whenever he was being
                        hit by the General he was just turning the other cheek. In four years he had
                        not said one bad thing about him. He (the President) was interested in
                        seeing European unity maintained and he did not want to add to any seeds of
                        dissension. He believed that if the chips were down <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would stand by the United States,
                        as he had done during the Cuban crisis. This action the President had not
                        forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor, returning to the question of British application to enter the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, stated that some decision would
                        have to be made within the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> during this
                        year with regard to Britain's application. His Government had made clear to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, and during the Rome
                        meeting, that they favored the British proposal. He had suggested that the
                        Chiefs of the six governments meet again toward the end of this year to
                        discuss the matter. However, he could only go so far in pushing the British
                        case. He could not act like “a bulldozer”. That would make the General only
                        more stubborn.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he did not think <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> knew how much respect the President had for the French
                        people and how much confidence he had in General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He thought the Chancellor could be helpful to the
                        United States as a sort of mediator in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The Chancellor replied he would
                        be glad to try to mediate and harmonize wherever possible. He considered his
                        last meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> (about
                        June 12) as the most important. With regard to the then just erupted
                        conflict in the Middle East <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        had expressed his concern about the possibility that Israel might not want
                        to relinquish the conquered territory. The President interjected that he was
                        concerned about the same matter.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was honest and serious when he told him during the
                        meeting that his foremost concern was peace for France and peace for Europe.
                        The German people had been confronted with a moral option at the beginning
                        of the Middle East crisis. He (<persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>) was happy that they had opted almost unanimously
                        for Israel. He thought this had proved again that the rumors and press
                        stories about a resurgence of neo-nazism were false.</p>
                    <p>The President stated he was often confronted with the problem of having an
                        image distorted by half a dozen newspaper people or other media, probably at
                        times with the intent to further the interests of certain groups.</p>
                    <p>He said since their interests were one and the same they should never fight
                        each other. If he and the Chancellor could stand together it would be an
                        essential contribution to stabilizing the world situation. A <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0638"/>closer United States-German cooperation
                        would be in the best interests not only of the two countries but would be of
                        benefit to all of Europe. He did not think that it had made any sense for
                        Germans to fight Americans in two big wars as they both hailed from the same
                        stock.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the Middle East crisis the President said that in his meeting
                        with Foreign Minister Abba Eban on May 26<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">A
                            memorandum of this conversation is scheduled for publication in volume
                            XIX.</note> he had tried hard to discourage any aggressive move on the
                        part of Israel and had tried to assure Mr. Eban that according to United
                        States intelligence information the Arab buildup was of a defensive nature
                        and did not point to an imminent Arab attack. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor thanked the President for informing him on this meeting and
                        the position taken by the United States in the Middle East conflict. He said
                        he had found this information extremely interesting.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then broke up about 2:00 p.m.</p>

                            ibid.)</note> Subject: Future of the Alliance Study.</p>
                    <p>1. Department has been reviewing status of Future of Alliance Study in
                        preparation for four sub-group meetings scheduled for September and early
                        October, and meeting of rapporteurs scheduled for October 12–13 in England.
                        With this timetable, we would envisage meeting of Special Group principals
                        at end of October. Purpose this message is to summarize our views at present
                        stage for background of addressee posts. Action with representatives of
                        other countries should be taken only by the US participants in the
                        Study.</p>
                    <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0639"/>
                    <p>2. We continue to attach major importance to speediest possible completion of
                        sub-group reports; to encouraging rapporteurs to submit substantive,
                        well-written analyses and conclusions; and to avoid at sub-group level
                        negotiated language representing lowest common denominator of fifteen
                        national positions. Thus, we continue to adhere generally to views outlined
                        in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> A.</p>
                    <p>3. Beyond foregoing points, however, we consider aims should be (a) that
                        Ministers receive for action in December a brief, substantive paper covering
                        the four sub-group reports; and (b) that there also be a brief public
                        document emanating from the Ministerial Meeting designed for maximum public
                        impact.</p>
                    <p>4. While development of tactics in connection with these aims will depend
                        importantly on developments between now and mid- October, it may be that, in
                        connection with their October 12–13 meeting, rapporteurs themselves can do
                        much of drafting of proposed covering report for Ministers. They should make
                        it possible for Special Group principals subsequently to concentrate on
                        resolving any outstanding substantive differences. Alternatively, covering
                        document for sub-group reports might have to be drafted in Special Group or
                        by PermReps and International Staff acting under its guidance. Our
                        preference, however, would be for first approach indicated above. Similarly,
                        there is question whether US would favor public release of this document or
                        whether published report should be written separately. We incline to latter
                        view but will take final decision later. Our decisions re tactics and
                        procedures will depend importantly on our reading of likely problems with
                        France and certain other countries.</p>
                    <p>5. Major point on which we are now clear is that public document, at least
                        should be a short summary of major findings and conclusions with minimum of
                        analysis and factual material. These might be included in December
                        Ministerial communique or issued separately. In order for our approach to
                        have best chance of success, all basic ideas should be built in at sub-group
                        level. This means that, in addition to clear statement and rationale for
                        indefinite continuation of the Alliance (including such things as integrated
                        military system, substantial forces, careful balance between detente and
                        deterrence, and general need to strengthen political consultation and policy
                        coordination), we need at least one major clearly-defined substantive or
                        institutional proposal relating to future tasks of the Alliance from each of
                        the sub-group reports.</p>
                    <p>6. It is these latter, in our judgment, that will have greatest impact on
                        official and public opinion in NATO countries; serve to demonstrate that
                        Alliance is looking to the next decade; and provide indispensable
                        counterpart to fundamental points about Western strength and cohesion that
                        are relatively undramatic but must be clearly reiterated and endorsed in
                        final report.</p>
                    <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0640"/>
                    <p>7. We have tentatively identified following points, additional to those cited
                        re maintenance of strong Alliance, that US participants should endeavor to
                        assure stand out as specific proposals or conclusions in sub-group
                        report.</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Sub-Group One (East-West Relations)</hi>. In addition to
                        providing defense and deterrence for the indefinite future, a principal
                        Alliance task for the late 1960s and 1970s will be to come to grips with the
                        problem of East-West security arrangements in Europe. This includes problem
                        of division of Germany and Berlin. Closest understanding and coordination
                        among Western countries desiring to contribute to resolution these basic
                        issues will be required prior to initiation of discussions between East and
                        West. While solid understanding is desirable among governments having
                        special responsibilities for German question (US, UK, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and France), there must also be broader
                        agreement within the Alliance. This means investigation on continuing basis
                        of all substantive issues of European security, in all their ramifications,
                        as well as consideration of procedural approaches to East-West negotiations.
                        This should be undertaken by a special group responsible to the Council, and
                        might well take form of a major continuation exercise deriving from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Sub-Group Two (Inter-Allied Relations)</hi>. We think
                        most useful idea to come out of this group would be one aiming at better
                        balance in the Alliance as between Western Europe and North America. While
                        US would not want to take the initiative in pushing the idea in formal
                        meetings, US participants should endeavor to stimulate Belgium or some other
                        country to put in appropriate proposal for increased European cohesion in
                        the Alliance framework (i.e., a development of the Belgian idea for a
                        “European caucus”). Such a proposal could relate to the principle of advance
                        discussions among all or some European members of the Alliance on subjects
                        for political consultation in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. For
                        various reasons it may not be possible to refine a proposal in the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study context by December. It would
                        nevertheless be very useful for the idea to be advanced as clearly as
                        possible with appropriate language to make clear that objective is to
                        improve Western European cohesion and cooperation on broad framework of
                        Atlantic cooperation.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Sub-Group Three (Defense Policy)</hi>. Report for this
                        Sub-Group, for which US has drafting responsibility, will include, in
                        addition to emphasis on Alliance strength and cohesion, proposal for
                        emphasis on disarmament and arms control matters. Specifically, it will
                        suggest creation of improved machinery for the Alliance including a new
                        Council-level, reinforced committee, strengthened international staff
                        capability in this field, and increased utilization of defense planning
                        procedures to advise on military implications of disarmament measures.</p>

                        Most important specific idea we would like to see emerge from this

                        intensification and greater flexibility of NATO consultations on problems
                        beyond the Treaty area. Thus, in addition to stressing need and right of
                        Alliance members to harmonize policies on world-wide issues, the report
                        should clearly establish the principle that groups consisting of less than
                        full Alliance membership can meet under NATO auspices to consult on selected
                        international questions. Rather than a permanent new committee or
                        committees, we might seek to establish general criteria to govern creation
                        of ad hoc groups to consult on specific issues as they arise. Most important
                        criterion in our opinion should be that consultations take place among
                        countries (a) that express a definite interest in problem under discussion
                        and (b) are prepared at least to contemplate possibility of harmonized
                        national policies and shared responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>. Beyond the above specific ideas, we would
                        also like to see another basic thought expressed in final report. This would
                        be strong statement that, much more than in past, NATO bodies should serve
                        as meeting place for senior officials from capitals. Purpose would be to
                        supplement work of Permanent Delegations with frequent exchanges among
                        officials in main stream of policy formulation at home. Analogy can be made
                        with <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> practice in this regard. This
                        point is applicable particularly to sub-groups one and four but may also
                        apply to other fields. There is notably example of NPG/<gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> which already represents substantial step
                        in this direction.</p>
                    <p>8. In addition to foregoing major points, there are perhaps limited number of
                        other specific initiatives that should be reflected in final summary and
                        published version. One that occurs to us would be endorsement of the
                        proposal to establish a new and official relationship between North Atlantic
                        Assembly (formerly NATO Parliamentarians Conference) and the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Proposal has thus far evoked apathetic
                        reaction from many Alliance members. It may stand a better chance if
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study report gives it a
                        boost and if problem is treated in context of broader efforts to strengthen
                        the Alliance.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that the US is
                        Italy's strongest ally and the world's greatest power. As such, US foreign
                        policy is followed very closely in Italy. He said that he was pleased at the
                        extent to which the President's presentation of our policy had confirmed the
                        Italian reading. He stressed that he spoke not for Italy as a world power,
                        but for Italy as a national power within Europe. He asked rhetorically what
                        the European situation would be if a Communist Government took power in
                        Italy. He said that while Italy's power might be relatively marginal, its
                        absence from the free world could produce severe consequences just as the
                        presence of Fascism in the peninsula had once affected the European
                        continent and the world. The most loyal and meaningful way for Italy to
                        serve the common cause is through an intelligent defense of democracy at
                        home. For democracy to give way to communism in Italy would be tragic, not
                        only for Italy, but the community of free nations as well. With regard to
                        the domestic political situation in Italy, President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> was optimistic. The forces of
                        democracy have for the moment and for the foreseeable future won the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The mainstay of Italian foreign policy is the Atlantic Alliance. For Italy a
                        Western orientation has historically brought progress while an Eastern
                        orientation has brought only grief. Italy is firmly convinced of the
                        necessity of the Alliance, and is equally convinced that without the
                        Alliance, there would be little hope of solving Europe's problems. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> enumerated what he felt to
                        be the major problems confronting Europe. First of all was France. In France
                        there exists a government that is both conservative and nationalistic. Even
                        if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were to disappear from
                        the scene, little change could be expected in French policy. <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0643"/>Unlike the situation which exists in Italy,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and his policies are
                        supported both by the forces of nationalism on the right and by communism on
                        the left, for other, but obvious, reasons. President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> felt that while this is not to say
                        that France is lost forever, we should not delude ourselves into thinking
                        that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s departure from the
                        stage will cause any early reversal of policy.</p>
                    <p>As for the Germans, President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName>
                        noted that after 23 years the German people are still divided four ways. No
                        solution to the German problem is presently in sight. Only time will tell
                        whether future generations of Germans will find different answers from those
                        of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>. It seems certain, however, that Germany cannot
                        remain divided and this poses a very serious problem which affects the life
                        of Europe. It is this European problem that looms largest in the world and
                        it is far more serious than even that of Viet-Nam. At present, some 20
                        million Germans are separated and isolated from some 60 million fellow
                        Germans. This creates a situation that the Germans cannot continue to live
                        with. President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that the
                        US Civil War had been fought to bring together a divided country. He could
                        not believe that the German people could indefinitely accept their division,
                        although he saw no way at present to solve the problem. He was convinced
                        that the Germans cannot long tolerate the status quo, although he added that
                        for the moment we cannot go to war for German unification. He was convinced
                        that a continuation of the present state of affairs could only bode ill for
                        the long run.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> saw the Atlantic
                        Alliance as a relationship between the US and Europe which involved the US
                        in seeking a solution to the underlying problems which beset Europe and in
                        preventing a repetition of past tragedies. Italy feels deeply that the ties
                        which bind the US and Europe must be preserved and strengthened. It also
                        feels that while it is essential that the US give its attention to the
                        problems of the world, it should give particular attention to the problems
                        of Europe. With regard to Europe, Italy continues to press for the admission
                        of Great Britain and the Scandinavian nations to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. It is the view of the Italian Government that Great
                        Britain must become a member of the Community because of Britain's
                        relationship with the US. British membership would insure that the US and
                        Europe would continue to stand together.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> warned against any
                        delusion that the USSR no longer wished to establish hegemony in Europe.
                        Although the Russians had perhaps renounced their former means of achieving
                        their goal, their basic aims had not changed. The size and the resilience of
                        the Communist Parties in France and Italy, both of which receive enormous
                        financial and moral support from the Soviet Union, attested to Russia's
                        ultimate goal. The fact that the USSR is unwilling to take a single step
                        toward German reunification also demonstrates that its objectives have not
                            <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0644"/>changed. It is thus essential
                        for both Europe and the US that the Alliance continue, for should Western
                        Europe come under the domination of the USSR, the US would no longer be the
                        strongest power in the world. It is, therefore, necessary that when we talk
                        about the relaxation of tensions, we remember that the Russians have not yet
                        renounced their policy objectives. Some would have us believe, and we are
                        occasionally advised in the press, that the Russia of today is different
                        from the Russia of the past. This is not true. Their objectives remain today
                        what they have always been: access to the Mediterranean, wider spread in the
                        Balkans, and eventually to spill over into Western Europe. While their
                        methods are no longer those of Stalin, we have all seen how any attempt by a
                        nation within their orbit to break away and pursue an independent policy is
                        immediately and brutally crushed.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that with the
                        approaching elections, NATO has become a major issue for Italy. The Italian
                        Government remains firmly convinced of the necessity of NATO not only for
                        military purposes, but also as a vital instrument to secure the existing
                        bonds between the US and Europe. Italy firmly believes in the partnership
                        which President Kennedy referred to in his speech at Philadelphia<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">For text of President Kennedy's speech at Philadelphia,

                        and which President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> referred
                        to in his speech of October 7, 1966.<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">See <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note> A strong NATO is the only
                        means which can prevent the loosening of the close ties uniting Western
                        Europe and North America. President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> felt that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s nationalism is more dangerous to the Alliance than
                        are the attacks of the Communists. The Communists realize this and therefore
                        lend their full-fledged support to Gaullist policies. There is a need today
                        for even stronger support of the Alliance. President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that he has consistently
                        supported the Alliance within Italy and his support has won for him the
                        strong resentment of the Italian Communists.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> said that he had
                        found his talks with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> on this subject to be most useful. Their talks
                        were held prior to <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s visit
                        to the US and they had dwelt at length on the importance of European unity
                        and had also touched upon the problem of German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the US respects the responsibilities of its allies
                        and we draw great comfort from Italy's support. We are in complete agreement
                        on the continued importance of Europe. The President said that he shared
                        President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName>'s views and he
                        expressed his gratitude for what President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> has done to maintain and strengthen the Atlantic
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0645"/>
                    <p>The President went on to say, however, that we also have alliances with
                        nations in the Pacific area. We are equally committed to these alliances and
                        it is our task to maintain the strength of both. He said that it should not
                        be difficult to imagine with what great concern he views the present
                        situation when we have six divisions stationed in Europe and half a million
                        men fighting in Viet-Nam. Those individuals in the US who wanted all these
                        men to come home increased his concern. He continued that while Italy might
                        be concerned by the present situation, he wondered how much greater their
                        concern would be if they had so many men committed abroad. To this must be
                        added the continued drafting of thousands of men each month which is
                        required by our present responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG7">Saragat</persName> replied that Italy's
                        support is based not only on the friendship which has so long existed
                        between our two nations, but equally rests on the realization that it was
                        the US which had secured Italy's freedom. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s France, and other European
                        countries as well, should be grateful to the US and that their actions
                        should reflect this gratitude. It was only as a friend of the US that he
                        felt called upon to raise certain viewpoints that had recently come to the
                        surface in Europe. This concern is of little importance in comparison with
                        the friendship of all those in Europe who know and realize that they owe
                        their freedom to the friendship and to the commitments of the US. It is
                        because of this strong friendship which exists in Italy that his country
                        will sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> … with improvements.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Tomkins said the Foreign Office would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s latest views on the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise as they had been hearing
                        some menacing noises from the French on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he believed the
                        French would hold their fire on the reports of the sub-groups, but that
                        their flak would probably come at the special group meetings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said his sub-group would try to
                        cover the French points as well as certain arrangements regarding essential
                        cooperation with the French, and would go on to stress that NATO should play
                        a more active role in disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> believed the report should stress that the present
                        possibility of detente derived from unity in the past. This was a lesson for
                        the future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> commented that
                        the French were angry that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had
                        written a report critical of them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tomkins referred to an article in the <hi rend="italic"> Le Monde </hi>
                        by Andre Fontaine which spoke of French withdrawal from the North Atlantic
                        Treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he did not
                        think that the French would consider withdrawing on account of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise. They might use the report
                        as a pretext, but this decision would be made for other reasons and by
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> alone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he personally was opposed to
                        watering down the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise
                        just to allow for that factor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tomkins said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> did not want to see
                        a report that was unacceptable to the French, but the British thought the
                        exercise must have a positive effect. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the French had been told there was no
                        desire to embarrass them or to argue about any of their actions. These must
                        be accepted as given facts and even mentioned, but not provocatively.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tomkins said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was concerned that
                        U.S. thinking presumed the need for formidable nuclear strength in NATO
                        which in turn suggested that there was no immediate prospect that the
                        security situation might be changing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> agreed that this was the U.S. view. He noted that the
                        Soviets were making tremendous efforts in the missile field as well as in
                        submarines, and that it would be folly not to take account of this. He said
                        our strength was in the balance of power on the continent. Mr. Tomkins
                        observed that the restatement of these truths would possibly not be welcome
                        to some European ears, especially if the French thought that NATO was coming
                        out against their policy of getting along with the Russians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that his report would temper
                        its language to deal with the French position, but he acknowledged that it
                        might be hard for the French to go along.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tomkins asked if the report would consider mutual reduction of forces.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that for the present
                        this was a non-starter as far as the Russians were concerned. It was worth
                        considering as a subject that would be topical, especially when the Vietnam
                        problem was over. However, <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0647"/>prospects for practical progress were nil at this stage, because the
                        Russians would not do anything likely to free U.S. troops for Vietnam. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that, before leaving
                        Moscow he had asked Deputy Foreign Minister Semenov if there was any
                        interest in reopening such old issues as military observers and security and
                        surprise attack measures. Semenov had replied that these were subjects of
                        potential interest but not under present political circumstances. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said, however, that NATO
                        should still set up machinery, including a strengthened international staff
                        capability, to deal with arms control and disarmament meas-ures. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed that, as our main
                        arms coordinating center, NATO could also be a major disarmament
                        coordinating center.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tomkins said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had the impression
                        that the U.S. now preferred that NATO not discuss mutual force reductions
                        outside the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that there was no
                        point in proceeding with this issue in specific terms, at this time.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> told the
                        Secretary the drafting of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        study on the future tasks of the Alliance was generally going along in <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0648"/>a positive and satisfactory way. He
                        spoke warmly of the contributions made by Mr. Rostow and his collaborators
                        and especially of the work of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> as rapporteur of the Third Sub-Group on defense
                        policy which was doing an outstanding job.</p>
                    <p>He then turned to the problem of French obstruction. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had completed a draft of the report
                        of the Second Sub-Group on Inter-Allied Relations, which the French refused
                        to accept. They even rejected a formulation that the Alliance was an element
                        for peace. This was a complete reversal of what <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had said at the last ministerial meeting in Paris.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said he was planning to
                        talk to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> in New York in the hope
                        of persuading him to be less obstructionist. In the past it had been
                        possible to make some headway by talking to him personally. It was much
                        preferable to continue with French acquiescence but it might be necessary to
                        proceed without them if they remained completely negative. With the
                        exception of the French the work had gone well with a lot of interest and
                        dynamism and the quality of the analysis and drafting had been high.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said, however, that the
                        drafting on Atlantic solidarity had been disappointing because a number of
                        Europeans and the Canadians had been holding back and had shown timidity in
                        discussing this topic.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was a very serious question in regard to France.
                        There was one report that <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> might
                        refuse to come to the December meeting in Brussels where the report will be
                        discussed. French conduct presented us with a dilemma. If the Fourteen
                        adjust to French sensibilities the report may have nothing in it. But if we
                        say what we think, this may give <hi rend="italic">deGaulle</hi> a pretext
                        for withdrawal. This basic question of political strategy deserves attention
                        at the highest level. The Secretary said that in his personal view we should
                        not let ourselves be blackmailed but this has some danger in it.</p>
                    <p>The NATO Foreign Ministers should exchange views on this vital question. But
                        it is much better for the other Foreign Ministers to try to discuss the
                        matter with the French.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, regarding Atlantic solidarity, the Secretary said that we are
                        willing to go as far as the Europeans wish us to go but that we cannot tell
                        the Europeans what they should do. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> replied that, in his view, the concept of Atlantic
                        solidarity was essential. The Secretary said it might conceivably be useful
                        if the question were discussed at some time, strictly among Europeans.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> replied that, in his
                        opinion, this question should never be discussed in a European caucus but in
                        all frankness with the U.S. and Canada.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then spoke of the work of the Fourth Sub-Group dealing with
                        NATO consultation or problems outside of the treaty area. European suspicion
                        that the U.S. was trying to entice Europeans into Vietnam or Cuba was wrong.
                        This was not what we had in mind at all. In our view, NATO cannot think
                        soundly about its security if it limits itself to considering <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0649"/>problems within the geographic framework of
                        the NATO area. Things outside the NATO area vitally affect NATO itself. The
                        Middle East crisis has shown that. It is impossible for NATO to ignore the
                        vast continent of Africa which is only twenty minutes by air from Europe. It
                        is only in the past year that Saclant has begun to think in terms of naval
                        operations in the Atlantic south of the NATO line. But it is ridiculous to
                        think in terms of two disconnected naval battles—one north and one south of
                        the NATO line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> agreed that NATO could not
                        ignore such interrelationships and advocated an exchange of information and
                        assessments regarding developments outside the NATO area. It had been a
                        great mistake for the Europeans not to have listened more attentively to the
                        American analysis of developments in the Middle East eight months ago. But
                        he said that the drafting of the fourth section had been the most difficult.
                        Vicomte Davignon, who had been working on the Report, said that the Third
                        Group was reaching positive conclusions but the work of the Fourth Committee
                        had been proceeding poorly. The members of the group were unwilling to
                        engage in serious and thorough discussions and the rapporteur had to do most
                        of the work himself.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> that we would do everything we could to support and
                        assist the work of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Group
                        and that we must keep in touch on the problem of French obstruction.</p>

                        guidance of addressee posts.</p>
                    <p>1. Belgian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> and
                        Under Secretary Rostow on October 3 held general review of status and
                        prospects Future of <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0650"/>Alliance Study.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> and Department officers were
                        present on US side. In addition to <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>, Belgian side included Davignon (<persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>'s Chef de Cabinet), Van der
                        Straten-Waillet of Foreign Ministry and Belgian Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Belgian Reaction to Work of Sub-Groups</hi>—Davignon
                        characterized Belgian view of Sub-Group work along following lines: Report
                        on East-West relations (Sub-Group I) has not caused major problems at
                        sub-group level. In Belgian view, however, it is too timid, especially
                        section on Germany which says less than public statements by German leaders.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>'s draft on inter-Allied
                        relations (Sub-Group II) has caused major difficulties with the French.
                        While <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> is unwilling to change
                        substance of the report, he is trying to make form less objectionable.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s report on defense policy
                        (Sub-Group III) is the best report substantively. It deals with matters that
                        primarily concern the Fourteen and thus provides less of a target for
                        French. Patijn's report on developments outside Treaty area (Sub-Group IV)
                        contains many good ideas but language is too far-reaching for a number of
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">French Intentions</hi>—Belgian side indicated concern
                        that, unless US and Belgium quietly spread word that they intend to see the
                        exercise through, a number of other countries will get cold feet in face of
                        present or anticipated French objections. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> expressed view that Fourteen should proceed prudently
                        but firmly including scheduled action by Ministers in December. He said that
                        even if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> should take France
                        out of the Alliance completely (something he thought would not be in
                        France's interest) the Fourteen would continue. For them to back down on
                        Future Alliance Study would be tantamount to giving up right to carry on
                        intensified political consultations. For the rest, <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> thought it best not to try to
                        speculate on French tactics or timing but deal with situations as they
                        arise.</p>
                    <p>4. Rostow expressed general agreement with <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>'s views. He emphasized that improved political
                        consultations are important in order to safeguard the ability of Allied
                        nations to act internationally. This was especially important for the US
                        given present domestic and international situation.</p>
                    <p>5. In response to Rostow's question, <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said he thought it would be desirable for the US or
                        Belgium to sound out French authorities quietly. He emphasized, however,
                        that this should not take form of a series of approaches which would
                        dramatize the situation and engage French prestige. He also thought approach
                        should be made only after rapporteurs' report from Ditchley Park meeting
                        October 11–12 is in hand. It was left that US and Belgium would be in touch
                        re this question after Ditchley meeting.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Form and Content of Report</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> thought it would not be practicable
                        to combine the four sub-group reports into one comprehensive <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0651"/>document. On other hand, he considered it
                        essential that Special Group have before it a single umbrella document or
                        covering report which would hopefully be produced by the rapporteurs. This
                        document should be primarily a set of conclusions on which Special Group
                        representatives could take positions. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said that rapporteurs' efforts naturally reflect
                        their individual personalities; that their work should be viewed as input to
                        the Special Group; but that main thing would be consolidated set of
                        conclusions. He cited <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> summary
                        for Sub-Group III as model. Rostow expressed general agreement with this
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>7. Belgians noted that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> is
                        prepared to take responsibility for drafting such a document after Ditchley
                        Park if necessary. They thought it would be difficult for him to take lead
                        at present stage lest he compromise his position with other countries,
                        especially France.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> expressed view that
                        substantial agreement must be reached at Special Group level. He thought it
                        most unlikely that Ministers in December could improve the package. As to
                        substance, he noted that each country would have some special point of
                        interest. Problem was for the Special Group to balance these out. Belgium,
                        for example, would be interested in highlighting the central importance of a
                        concerted allied program for reducing tensions with the Communist world,
                        pointing towards an ultimate settlement. If the approach was not accepted in
                        the first instance, that would be regrettable. But it is of great political
                        importance that we make the effort.</p>
                    <p>9. In response to questions by Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> expressed opinion that Special Group could readily
                        agree on language to identify problems and goals re Germany and European
                        security. He recognized that there would be difficulty in defining methods
                        for Western consultations on these issues, however. The German question
                        affected all Alliance members. Belgium at any rate would be opposed to a
                        restricted body in NATO to consult on this issue. Rostow and <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said that after consideration of
                        all the alternatives, they agreed.</p>
                    <p>10. Rostow noted importance we must all attach to German views in this
                        general area. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed out that
                        while Germans favor Allied consultations, they have a big interest in
                        avoiding any derogation from quadripartite responsibilities. Rostow remarked
                        that Future of Alliance report should make clear that future NATO
                        consultations should not imply such derogation. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> noted that it might be preferable to identify
                        problem and issues but not try to spell out plan for establishment of a
                        group in NATO as part of <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        exercise.</p>
                    <p>11. On issues outside NATO area, Rostow emphasized importance of NATO
                        consultations covering, for example, the Middle East and Africa. Such
                        consultations should be open to those NATO countries wishing to participate.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> agreed that it was
                        important for the Alliance to consider developments in regions in close
                        proximity to the <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0652"/>Treaty area. He
                        hoped the report would include clear language on this point.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> raised question (which had
                        interested Belgians early this year) of asking NATO countries “to sign on”
                        to the Treaty for a specified number of years beyond 1969; i.e., to agree
                        not to exercise withdrawal rights under Article 13. He had now come around
                        to view that question was too sensitive and complex to be handled in this
                        manner. Important thing, he thought, was for the Future of the Alliance
                        Study to make clear by implication that Alliance is not only necessary but
                        would continue automatically for an indefinite period in order to accomplish
                        its objectives; e.g. bringing about a European settlement. Rostow stated US
                        in full agreement with Belgium on this point.</p>
                    <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Arrangements for Special Group Meeting</hi>—On
                        assumption that rapporteurs will complete their work at Ditchley meeting
                        October 11–12, both sides considered it important that Special Group meet as
                        near November one as possible. Exact timing is to be worked out through
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>. Both sides thought two
                        full days would be required and that a second session might be necessary
                        prior to December Ministerial Meeting. Rostow expressed view Special Group
                        might meet over a weekend in case three days needed.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said he attached special
                        importance to high-level, political attendance in the cases of a number of
                        countries. Examples were: Germany, where Scheutz or his successor should be
                        urged to come; Canada; Denmark; Italy; Netherlands; Turkey and UK. He also
                        thought considerable diplomatic preparation might be necessary between
                        Ditchley meeting and Special Group meeting and suggested Belgium had already
                        been active in urging high-level participation. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> plans to attend himself, and has told Luns his
                        attendance is essential.</p>

                    <p>4932. Subject: Great Britain, the Common Market, and Europe. During a
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>
                        today I asked him if there was <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0653"/>any
                        proof to the various rumors around about a possible European conference next
                        year. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that everybody
                        seemed to ask the French this question—the Russians, Poles, and others—but
                        that they had not and would not make any suggestion for any such conference
                        and he did not believe that the time was propitious for any such
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>In passing reference to Britain and the Common Market <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that Commission's report would
                        have to be studied which he thought would be the position which he would
                        take at the meeting of the Ministers on October 23. I told him that it
                        looked to me as though the difference between French position and that of
                        the Commission was quite narrow; that the Commission felt that the economic
                        and financial situation of Britain was not such that she could join the
                        Common Market but that the best method of examining it would be by
                        negotiation whereas France felt that the situation of Great Britain in
                        addition precluded negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
                        admitted that as matters now stood this was approximately correct.</p>

                        <item>Ditchley Park Meeting on Future of the Alliance—Information Memorandum
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. I have just returned from several weeks in Europe during which I visited
                        Paris, London, Bonn, Copenhagen and Brussels mainly on the Harmel exercise
                        on the Future of NATO. </p>
                    <p>2. With the informal approval of the Rapporteurs, I prepared for their
                        meeting at Ditchley Park on October 11–12 a resume of the findings and
                        conclusions of the four Reports which had just been completed. With a few
                        additions and changes the Ditchley meeting decided to forward <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0654"/>the document to the Special Group to assist
                        it in its work. I am attaching a copy of this resume in this form (2d
                            clip).<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">A handwritten note on the source text
                            indicates that an <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> status report on
                            the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study was attached at
                            the first clip and <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>'s
                            summary at the second clip. Neither is printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. While the style betrays its composite origin, I think the resume states
                        pretty well the situation the Alliance now faces and its tasks for the
                        future. </p>
                    <p>4. From the Reports, resume and discussion, the following points seem to me
                        worth noting:</p>
                    <p>(a) The study on the whole takes a balanced view of present Soviet attitudes
                        and military strength and reaffirms the continuing need for the Alliance.
                        While feeling secure, Europeans are aware that the source of their security
                        is mainly the U.S. commitment and capacity.</p>
                    <p>(b) There is a general desire to use the Alliance for concerting efforts
                        towards detente. In practice, however, ideas on the prospects and what to do
                        vary widely; this may severely tax efforts for a common line. Two major
                        motives of the Europeans are to keep a check on the U.S.-USSR dealings and
                        on West German activity.</p>
                    <p>(c) The Reports assert that there are real European interests in the area
                        beyond NATO. In practice, however, the Europeans are extremely reluctant to
                        involve themselves outside the NATO areas, partly due to the sense of
                        impotence in influencing the U.S. in such fields.</p>
                    <p>(d) The resume states much more frankly than is customary the effects of the
                        disparity in power and influence between the U.S. and the European allies.
                        Whether one talks to the UK, Germans, Benelux, or others, this is a central
                        factor in defining the relations within the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>(e) The Reports recognize (less clearly than one might wish) that changes in
                        procedure will be only palliatives so long as the serious power disparity
                        continues. Most Europeans, including the British, recognize clearly that the
                        only effective answer would be European unity in some form, but they vary
                        widely in assessing prospects for achieving it. If the Europeans should
                        acquire active confidence in achieving further cohesion, this might
                        materially improve the morale in the Alliance even though its achievement
                        took some while.</p>
                    <p>5. The resume probably reflects fairly well the views of almost all the
                        Allies except the French, who seem likely to try to block a fruitful outcome
                        of the exercise. Apparently, they intended to put pressure on the Germans,
                        the Canadians, and perhaps others to this end. For various reasons these
                        Allies are most reluctant to have a head-on clash with the French at this
                        time. In this situation, careful handling will be required to assure a
                        constructive outcome. The question may come down to whether <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0655"/>or not to accept practical consensus of the
                        Fourteen without a resounding declaration. In any case, the U.S. will need
                        to consider very carefully the resulting tactical issues over the coming
                        weeks.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_REVD1">Eugene Rostow</persName> introduced the subject
                        by briefly sketching the background to the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study and the steps which led to the present critical
                        and political phase. The Special Group, authorized by the Council to review
                        the tasks of the Alliance, will meet on November 7 to consider the reports
                        made to it by the four sub-groups. An excellent Summary of these reports was
                        prepared at last week's Ditchley Park meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> Mr. Rostow explained
                        that originally there had been some thought given to a special declaration
                        reaffirming each nations commitment to the Alliance beyond 1969. The general
                        view at the moment <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0656"/>seemed to be
                        that no specific declaration would be sought, but the continuance of the
                        Alliance as long as danger continued would be clearly implied. </p>
                    <p>For most member governments, it was important domestically that NATO play,
                        and be seen to play, a positive political role in sponsoring policies to
                        improve political relations with the Communist nations. Except for France,
                        there is probably solid support for a strong result from the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise. All members are concerned
                        about the possibility of hostile reactions from France, or even a withdrawal
                        from the Alliance. It is generally thought that if France decides to
                        withdraw it will not need the excuse of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise to do so. On the other hand it would be
                        easier to withdraw from the “feeble hulk” of NATO if it failed to revitalize
                        its methods of political consultation. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> has told us that, while he wishes to avoid provoking
                        the French, he is clear that we must not sacrifice any of the essential
                        elements of the problem in order to propitiate France. It does not seem
                        likely at this time that we shall have to consider going ahead with just
                        Fourteen as we have had to do in the military field. If this kind of
                        confrontation with the French appears unavoidable prior to the Ministerial
                        Meeting, we would of course have to go back to the President.</p>
                    <p>The ideal situation from our point of view would be to get approval of the
                        Summary by the Special Group which would then transmit the paper to the
                        Council as its own report. Between now and November 7 we will be exploring
                        the reaction of governments to this Summary. We will also be trying to
                        clarify and guide—not too oppressively—the reaction of our NATO partners,
                        and their ideas as to procedure for the next two months.</p>
                    <p>On substance, the ideas in the Summary fall mainly under the headings of
                        European security arrangements, including the German problem; disarmament
                        and arms control; and activities outside the strict Treaty area. The failure
                        of Europe to speak with any authority during the Middle Eastern crisis has
                        been felt in Europe. There was now a more forthcoming attitude toward the
                        kind of consultation on Mediterranean and Middle Eastern problems which
                        Ambassador Holmes was beginning. Progress in these consultations during the
                        present period should help NATO reach a decision in the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise to continue them through an
                        open-ended group at a level of political responsibility. With respect to
                        NATO consultations on problems arising outside the Treaty area, Mr. Rostow
                        thought the Middle East and North Africa were the obvious subjects with
                        which to start the process of evolution within NATO. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow sketched the general tactical situation. He said that while there
                        had originally been talk of a ringing Ministerial Declaration to be issued
                        in December, we should be content to play the ministerial <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0657"/>decisions in a low key. This could best be
                        done by Ministerial affirmation of the Summary document or a version thereof
                        as a kind of on-going work program. We should try to avoid the word “new”,
                        so as not to cause problems with the French unnecessarily. All governments
                        could make their own statements of what had been decided and play up those
                        aspects of particular domestic importance to them.</p>
                    <p>There had been talk about various alternative procedures for carrying forward
                        the work recommended on European security arrangements, including the German
                        problem. We had no particular preferences as to procedure. But NATO could
                        not displace the underlying responsibilities of the United States, France,
                        and Britain in Germany. Any consultative procedures to be developed would
                        have to take this fact into account.</p>
                    <p>There could be a continuing discussion of arms policy and force reductions
                        and this could be done either in a new body or in one of the existing
                        committees. On the Mediterranean Study, the creation of an open-ended
                        committee should be considered for those who wish to participate seriously
                        in this NATO activity.</p>
                    <p>Before beginning the discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> circulated the letter from Mr. Barr <note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">Not found.</note> stating Treasury views on the
                        desirability of NATO considering cooperative methods for financing the
                        presence of Allied troops in countries other than their own. Mr. Rostow said
                        that he has been in contact with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and Mr. Deming on the subject, which is before the
                        new Deming Committee. They will pursue the problem in that forum. He
                        regarded it as much too late to raise the issue in the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise. On the merits, he agreed
                        with the Treasury view, and we intended to move ahead in the Deming
                        Committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> agreed. He
                        also commented with respect to the last paragraph of Mr. Barr's letter that
                        he was not prepared to say that we were wrong in our long-standing policy on
                        European unification.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze stressed the importance of progress in reviewing the strength of
                        the Alliance. He agreed wholeheartedly with the conclusion in paragraph 27
                        that a lack of action in December would be a major failure. Mr. Nitze
                        thought that most of the Alliance were together on the importance of defense
                        arrangements, and on the importance also of better political consultation.
                        Even with regard to France, there seemed to be some progress with respect to
                        certain areas of the study, particularly Mediterranean problems. He thought
                        we should put emphasis on this. On East-West policy, the Germans are the
                        linch-pin since they were sensitive both to French concerns and generally on
                        East-West policy since <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0658"/>their
                        interest was the most immediate. Therefore he recommended that we let the
                        Germans take the lead on this.</p>
                    <p>General Wheeler said that the Chiefs wish to second what Paul Nitze had said
                        and emphasized the great importance they attached to positive movement in
                        the Alliance. If not, it would not just be a question of “running down”, but
                        rather of the Alliance's possible fragmentation and disappearance. While not
                        attempting to deliberately antagonize <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, we should certainly not avoid doing what is necessary
                        just in order to placate him. We don't need a dramatic declaration but we do
                        need something positive even if in low key. All the Chiefs concurred in this
                        view. He said he had no trouble with the substance of the Summary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said that on the
                        tactical situation there seemed to be basic agreement among all those
                        present on the necessity for reinvigorating the political side of NATO. We
                        should be much worse off if no action were taken. Mr. Marks referred to his
                        recent sampling study of public opinion showing strong support in Britain,
                        Germany, France and Italy for a NATO role in East-West political
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> described the
                        current political situation in NATO and how it differed from the
                        confrontation with the French last year over defense matters. He said that
                        the balance was now quite changed. At this point, some countries which had
                        been unwilling to engage in a debate with the French on defense policy a
                        year ago were now taking a strong position because the issue was or appeared
                        to be “detente”. He said the US was now somewhere in the middle between the
                        Danes and others who wanted a NATO political role in detente and the Germans
                        who feared offending the French with emphasis on political tasks. He too
                        stressed the fact that the US should not be particularly interested in a
                        public declaration, but rather wanted clear decisions, a good statement, and
                        a solid “working program”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> made the point that the
                        East-West relations report prepared by a German and a British official was a
                        good, modest step-by-step program which did not aim at the fundamental
                        security problem. It was his hope that the Germans might get the French to
                        go along with this proposal. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> seems concerned that the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> proposals would seek to “control” the policies of the
                        member countries, and not to be objecting to consultation as such. He
                        stressed that if the French stay out of an agreement on East-West policies
                        there is not much NATO can do because the French are essential to any such
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> summed up the situation by
                        saying that we needed enough in the way of positive elements for the
                        Ministers to agree upon for a businesslike communique. Then we could let the
                        Ministers portray the results in their own way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> stressed the necessity of
                        avoiding a German “run-out”. He supported Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>'s analysis that the best tactic
                        was <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0659"/>to aim for agreement on
                        specific actions in order to minimize conflict with the French about
                        formally approving reports or agreeing on major declarations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow accepted the statement that the reports should not be approved as
                        such but left to stand as the work of the Rapporteurs. But he thought
                        something had to be approved and suggested that this could be the Summary or
                        a document of equivalent import that would be proposed by the Special Group.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that he hesitated
                        about this because he thought that this would lead to a renegotiation of the
                        Summary and much of its content might be lost; it was better to retain it as
                        a clear statement which could be used by individual members as they
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> summarized the
                        situation by stating that all agreed that the Summary was a good statement
                        of where the Alliance stands and provides good guidance for a future work
                        program. All agreed that it was important that the exercise not be a failure
                        however big or little a success it might be. All present also wished to get
                        as much of the substance approved in its existing form without getting
                        involved in a negotiation which might squeeze down the amount of substance
                        in the report. Finally, the worst situation we could be in would be to get
                        expectations up of a major move and then have the Germans defect and NATO
                        perhaps lose prestige in the process. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> picked up the point about not needing a political
                        declaration in the United States. He said this should not be overdone. We
                        want a document which will help us convince people in the United States of
                        the importance of NATO so that it cannot be said that we are neglecting
                        Europe or allowing NATO to disintegrate. At most we could hope to get an
                        approved version of the Summary and at least some agreement that the
                        Secretary General would develop NATO actions from the Summary plus the
                        announcement of some specific action at the time of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Meeting.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> thought that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> and the Secretary
                        might have to help out in a later stage when it would be necessary to show
                        that the United States was prepared to get into a fight with the French,
                        while not necessarily seeking such a confrontation. We would also have to
                        work with the Germans and emphasize to them the importance of NATO having a
                        political role in order for the United States to maintain public support for
                        our troop commitment in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> agreed and said further that the question was not
                        so much a fight with the French but more the effect on the Germans. We don't
                        mind fighting with the French as long as we can maintain the unity of the
                        Fourteen.</p>

                    <p>3313. <gloss target="#t_Busec1">BUSEC</gloss>. Subject: UK-Common Market:
                        Where do we stand?</p>
                    <p>1. British strategy and tactics during past six months have been both
                        intelligent and effective:</p>
                    <p>A. They put in a straightforward and uncomplicated application, and have
                        focused their efforts since on the single issue of getting a dialogue
                        going.</p>
                    <p>B. They appear to have grasped that this cannot be played as a traditional
                        intergovernmental negotiation but requires an effort to manipulate the
                        domestic politics of the Six.</p>
                    <p>C. They have stopped talking about their own “problems” and have undermined
                        previous French tactics by showing a willingness (once negotiations begin)
                        to discuss all legitimate issues, including British domestic situation and
                        sterling problem.</p>
                    <p>D. They have gone a long way to solidify support of “Europeans” in
                        Commission, in the Five and even in France by stressing need for a strong
                        Europe able to stand up to us and play its role on world scene, and by
                        hinting that Britain as a member would be in forefront of move towards
                        greater economic and even political integration.</p>
                    <p>2. As a result, the British are over the first hump—the Six must now face the
                        issue, and discuss the issues on basis of a Commission report which makes
                        clear all problems are soluble given goodwill and determination. The problem
                        for the British, the Commission and the Five, is how to engage a dialogue
                        and get down to problem-solving.</p>
                    <p>3. French reaction to this evolution is clear from <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>'s presentation:</p>
                    <p>A. The General remains unalterably opposed to British entry, at least for
                        foreseeable future (i.e. until Britain has been brought to her knees by
                        unsolved economic problems).</p>
                    <p>B. But he appears unwilling or unable to use flat veto because</p>
                    <p>—it would create crisis in Community, and 1956–66 experience demonstrated
                        France has greatest stake of all in Community's survival;</p>
                    <p>—veto be bad French domestic politics, given public support for British
                        entry, particularly after Giscard's public stand reported Paris 5530.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">Dated October 20. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0661"/>
                    <p>C. Hence French position will be</p>
                    <p>—to delay and discourage, in hopes British will voluntarily withdraw or stop
                        pushing application, at least for a while;</p>
                    <p>—to keep British on the defensive by emphasizing the issue on which they are
                        weakest—British inability to break through stop-go cycle and reconcile
                        growth with balance of payments surplus;</p>
                    <p>—to agitate “nationalization” of sterling as an issue which would necessarily
                        take a long time to solve.</p>
                    <p>4. German position was clearly stated in off record talk by <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kies-inger</persName> at House of Commons
                        yesterday:</p>
                    <p>A. Germany favors and will continue to support British application.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> pointed out that over
                        60 percent of the German people support British membership even though only
                        38 percent think it would be to Germany's economic benefit.)</p>
                    <p>B. But German Govt will not at this stage try to force any decisions (even on
                        opening negotiations) by leading the Five in a face-down with France.
                        Because:</p>
                    <p>—German relations with France remain essential, especially to <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kies-inger</persName>;</p>
                    <p>—to do so might risk a crisis in Common Market, and Germany too cannot afford
                        such a crisis;</p>
                    <p>—in any case, Germans don't think the tactic would work—“if you want to bring
                        a girl to the altar, you must first persuade her.”</p>
                    <p>C. Hence Germans (who hold the key) propose to follow strategy of not forcing
                        issue but maintaining steady pressure on French in the expectation that
                        eventually France will yield to the pressure of “European public opinion.”
                        (Everybody is too polite to discuss frankly whether this means before or
                        after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> leaves the
                        scene.)</p>
                    <p>5. From British viewpoint, German position knocks out theoretical option
                        (probably favored by some) of trying to push the Five into face-down with
                        France, first on starting negotiations and then on final decision. Instead,
                        they must prepare for the long pull. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s statement yesterday (London 3270)<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">Dated October 24. (Ibid.)</note> that “time is on our
                        side” confirms that this is <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s view.
                        While it is not yet clear what the talk of “strengthening <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>” (reported separately) means, our initial
                        judgment is that this is largely razzle-dazzle designed to maintain sense of
                        forward movement until things sort themselves out more clearly in <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Council.</p>
                    <p>6. Whether time is really on Britain's side will depend largely on evolution
                        of domestic economic and balance of payments situation in coming months. We
                        will be in better position to assess this after October returns are in.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary Conclusions</hi>: The prospects are poor at this
                        time for reaching an accord with the Soviet Union for a mutual reduction of
                        forces in Europe. Nevertheless, existing economic and political pressures
                        among some NATO members to reduce defense expenditures are likely to
                        continue and may increase. These pressures are presently manifested in
                        budgetary defense cuts by some NATO Allies and in interest in pursuing a
                        NATO study of mutual force reductions. At such time as the Soviets evince
                        interest in the subject any discussions should be based on a step-by-step,
                        “mutual example” approach. This approach could feature either a US–USSR
                        trade-off or percentage reductions of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces. In the
                        former case, prior agreement should be sought from our NATO Allies, who
                        would expect to make corresponding reductions in their forces. In the latter
                        case, our Allies would of necessity be involved in planning the approach.
                        NATO discussion now of mutual troop reductions should be directed toward
                        agreement upon procedures and general guidelines, rather than an early
                        discussion of specific numbers of troops and reductions, which could
                        precipitate a divisive debate that would prove disadvantageous to US

                    <p>We and several of our NATO Allies have sought on a number of occasions to
                        discuss the question of mutual troop reductions with the USSR. However, the
                        Soviets show no inclination to make any cuts in their forces in Eastern
                        Europe, either by agreement or by “mutual example”. They say that European
                        frontiers must be settled first and that, in any case, they could not agree
                        to any arrangement which would free US troops to fight in Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>This Soviet caution contrasts with its position in mid-1966 when the USSR
                        showed some tentative interest in the possibility of mutual troop
                        reductions. During the months following, however, Soviet representatives
                        have become increasingly cool to the idea.</p>
                    <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0663"/>
                    <p>For example, British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> raised the question of mutual troop reductions with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in London on February 10,
                        1967. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s only comment was that
                        a prerequisite for any such reductions was to get European frontiers
                        settled. An officer of the Soviet Embassy in London later confirmed to us
                        that the British report was correct and that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had indeed set a new precondition (settlement of
                        frontier questions) for mutual reductions of troops in Europe. The Soviet
                        officer added that his Government was under considerable pressure internally
                        and from the North Vietnamese not to take actions which would make it easier
                        for the US to draw troops from Europe for use in Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>On March 17, Soviet Ambassador to the so-called German Democratic Republic
                        Abrasimov told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
                        that the USSR favors a continuation of the status quo. Abrasimov said that,
                        as regards reciprocal withdrawals, the USSR would wait for deeds, not words.
                        After the US, the UK, and France withdrew from Germany (it was not clear
                        whether he meant all or part), then the Soviet Union would withdraw from
                        East Germany. In July, West German Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> offered to discuss with the
                        USSR reciprocal troop withdrawals from Germany; but, to date, the Soviets
                        have given him no encouragement.</p>
                    <p>As recently as August 17, a Soviet Embassy officer told a Department of State
                        official that the USSR would not reduce its forces in Europe because it
                        would do nothing to enable the US to send more troops to Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, then, there appears to be no prospect that the Soviet
                        Union and Warsaw Pact will commit themselves to match any Western troop
                        reductions with cuts of their own.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow 9 pages of discussion of the details that might go into a mutual
                        reduction of forces.]</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Mr. Rostow began the discussion by reporting on a talk he had just had
                        with the German Permanent Representative, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>. Following the discussion between
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> on October 16 there had been some
                        discussion between Beaumarchais and Sahm. There had been a Franco-German
                        understanding as the result of these discussions. The Germans are now
                        working on the idea of a 5–6 page declaration to be adopted by Ministers.
                        This declaration would be complete in itself and there would be no need for
                        a classified report to be adopted by Ministers.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Rostow said that, as presented by <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>, the Germans envisaged a document that would recite
                        the history of the exercise; explain the need for intensified political
                        consultations including a reference to the Wise Men's Report; and identify
                        the future political tasks. The latter would break down into four headings,
                        namely, improving East-West relations; problems of European security
                        including the German question; arms control; and the special problem of the
                        Mediterranean. The German proposal would also refer to the need for
                        open-ended bodies, with the Western Four to be the nucleus for the German
                        and European security discussion.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Rostow went on to say that he had urged the Germans to speak early,
                        perhaps immediately after <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>.
                        This could have a galvanizing <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0665"/>effect on the meeting since others would assume that the Germans had been
                        in touch with the French and were aware of what the French would accept.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Rostow said that <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> did not
                        yet have authority from Bonn to make his proposal. <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> was in the process of clearing it.
                        If he succeeded, and came up with a generally acceptable paper, it might be
                        best for other delegates not to submit papers. This might only confuse the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>5. In response to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>, Mr. Rostow said that <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> had made clear that he could not guarantee French
                        acceptance of the German ideas.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Rostow asked whether <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> had
                        heard of any sentiment in favor of postponing action on the Future of the
                        Alliance Study beyond the December Ministerial meeting. The Italian
                        Permanent Representative had recently raised this point with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>, although it may have
                        been only a personal comment. <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                        had not envisaged a postponement but had envisaged continuing study of some
                        subjects if agreement were not possible in December.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> indicated he still
                        thought a result was necessary in December. He was aware that some countries
                        are hesitant. He recalled that the exercise was not designed to be a trap
                        for France or any other country. Belgium, like the U.S., attached importance
                        to the reported Franco-German understanding. Belgium had generally come to
                        the same conclusions as the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> thought it important to find a common point of
                        departure in last December's resolution. He also thought that substance was
                        more important than what might turn out to be only a watered-down
                        declaration. Thus, it would be prudent to concentrate on selecting several
                        carefully-designed themes to steer the Alliance in new directions.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said he thought that
                        Belgium would be in agreement with the German ideas as outlined by Mr.
                        Rostow. He agreed on the order of priorities, namely, East-West relations in
                        general, European security and Germany; arms control problems; and the
                        Mediterranean. Open- ended groups might be established on other subjects at
                        a later time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> felt the
                        question of a Ministerial declaration could be taken up later after
                        substantive questions were settled.</p>
                    <p>9. There followed a discussion on procedures in which Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> and Rostow agreed that it would be
                        good to press the Special Group discussions as far as possible on the
                        following day. They recognized, however, that it might be necessary to
                        continue on the morning of Wednesday, November 8. In any case, Mr. Rostow
                        doubted that everything could be settled at the Special Group meeting. Any
                        decisions taken, and especially any specific language, would have to be
                        agreed ad referendum.</p>
                    <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0666"/>
                    <p>10. Reverting to the proposed work program, <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said that it would be important to make clear that
                        East-West problems were larger than the problem of Germany. He thought there
                        would always be some problem with East-West relations and, therefore, need
                        for the Alliance. It would be a disaster if the Alliance should disappear
                        even should the Soviet threat change.</p>
                    <p>11. There followed a discussion of the status of the Rapporteurs' reports.
                        Both sides agreed that they might be attached to the Special Group's report
                        as reference documents but that governments would not be asked to take any
                        action.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> asked about the content of
                        Patijn's report. He thought we should not lose the ideas involved but pursue
                        them later in a supplementary group or groups. Mr. Davignon expressed the
                        view that much of Patijn's work, including his more positive ideas, ought to
                        be used as input for an analytical study to be done by the International
                        Staff. We needed more analysis of changes in the Communist world and in the
                        Western world. It would be good for once if the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> would forget about trying to produce an agreed document and
                        have a paper in this general area reflecting the different national
                        positions. In any case, the issue was too big and too difficult for the
                        Special Group to settle on the following day.</p>
                    <p>13. The Belgian and U.S. sides then exchanged information about contacts they
                        had had with other countries. Davignon had talked with Mr. De Ranitz of the
                        Netherlands who was in general agreement on the work program idea. Mr.
                        Rostow and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>
                        mentioned the Italian sensitivities on the Middle East and explained why we
                        were proposing to call the study a Mediterranean exercise. Mr. Vaes said he
                        understood that the Danes and Norwegians were presently coordinating their
                        positions. Denmark was no longer the weakest country in the Alliance on this
                        subject. The Scandinavians disliked, however, the idea of open-ended groups.
                        Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> and Rostow agreed that
                        the Canadians might not be as weak as anticipated. Mr. Rostow said we had
                        indications that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MPJ3">Martin</persName> was more
                        positive than his staff.</p>
                    <p>14. There followed a brief discussion on the importance of semantics in
                        dealing with the French. Messrs. Davignon and Rostow mentioned the
                        importance of avoiding any implications of common policies or integration.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said we should be careful
                        that we not go too far. He thought it would be better to formulate the
                        proposition in terms of the freedom of interested members to consult without
                        obliging others to participate. Davignon agreed. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> noted that the nature of consultation
                        could range from simple exchanges of information to common action in
                        particular cases.</p>
                    <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: Following the meeting, discussion continued
                        at a working dinner in the Belgian Finance Ministry. The discussion at
                        dinner dealt <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0667"/>with disarmament and
                        arms control questions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        asked whether we saw any possibility for regional European arms limitations
                        actions. Messrs. Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> pointed to the great
                        difficulty of separating regional arms control problems from the problems of
                        general disarmament. They also failed to see any present indication that the
                        Soviet Union really was interested now. Nevertheless, they said we are
                        prepared to study these matters and persevere in efforts to interest the
                        Russians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> said he was
                        convinced that limited initiatives on regional arms control issues were
                        desirable even if the Russians failed to respond at present. There would be
                        certain political advantages.</p>

                    <p>A general consensus on both substantive and procedural matters was reached
                        among all the NATO members except France at a meeting of the Special Group
                        which is conducting the Future Tasks of the Alliance Study (<persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study), held in Brussels on November
                        7 and 8. In the face of this consensus, the French, reluctantly and after
                        some delay, agreed to go along with the procedural approach favored by their
                        allies. This meeting thereby instructed NATO Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> to draft a report to the NATO
                        ministers (as called for by a ministerial decision of December 1966) which
                        would be based on the Special Group's discussion and would be submitted for
                        consideration and approval at a second meeting, scheduled for November
                        22.</p>
                    <p>The French made clear once again that they will continue to raise every kind
                        of difficulty, relating to both substance and procedure, to torpedo or
                        drastically water down the outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study. It was also clear, however, that they are
                        inclined to desist when they think they have accomplished as much as they
                        can at a given meeting. It is to be <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0668"/>expected that the French will continue to pursue these tactics down to and
                        at the December Ministerial meeting. But it is probable that, if the
                        Fourteen can continue to maintain the unity shown at this meeting in defense
                        of a genuine if limited consensus among themselves that is not provocative
                        to French policy, the French will not in the end try to block adoption of a
                        report (though they may note their dissent from some or all of it) or, a
                        fortiori, take stronger measures of reprisal against the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">French Tactics</hi>. The French agreement to stand aside
                        to permit preparation of the draft report (termed superfluous by Roger
                        Seydoux, the French permanent representative) was announced only on the
                        second day of the meeting, following an overnight adjournment to permit the
                        French to seek new instructions. But while finally agreeing to this
                        procedural detail, the French continued to find fault with the proposed
                        substantive conclusions of the Study. At the same time, the other NATO
                        allies voiced general agreement that the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study should lead to positive substantive results,
                        the theme of which would be the need for continuing the Alliance's deterrent
                        function while at the same time pursuing political conciliation between East
                        and West. This outcome envisions a work program for the Alliance to include
                        intensified and systematic attention to improving East-West relations,
                        European security and the German problem, arms control and disarmament, and
                        the study of Mediterranean security.</p>
                    <p>In the debate, the Germans, who have been particularly reluctant to risk
                        antagonizing the French over the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> exercise, agreed to this general work program and
                        firmly supported the necessity of producing a Special Group report to the
                        ministers in response to the original resolution. The Canadians and the
                        Danes, also sensitive to the French attitude toward the Study, likewise gave
                        reasonably forthcoming presentations.</p>
                    <p>The French representative replied to the views expressed by his colleagues by
                        questioning the ability of NATO to act as an agent of detente. He reiterated
                        the view that relations between East and West should not be carried on
                        between blocs and questioned suggestions that the Alliance should try to
                        devise a security system for Europe or arms control proposals. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> also asked why specific subjects
                        for consultation should be listed, thus limiting the field after eighteen
                        years of successful consultation within the Alliance. In a slightly veiled
                        reference to France's power to obstruct, he pointed to the importance of
                        preserving a spirit of cohesion and solidarity in an Alliance which requires
                        decisions to be taken unanimously. He also questioned whether the proposed
                        Mediterranean study was really to be concerned with the Middle East, in
                        which case he felt that all were agreed that this problem should be left to
                        the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>In private conversations with US officials attending the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> said that French Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> not only <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0669"/>did not like the idea of a report
                        prepared by the Secretary General for the NATO ministers, but indeed hoped
                        that there would be no report at all. It is clear that the French would
                        still like to reduce the conclusions of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study to a paragraph in a ministerial communique. But
                        later, when <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> yielded on the
                        procedural point and would agree to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s preparing a draft statement, he switched his attack
                        back to the substance. The French representative even asked for US help in
                        obtaining a report to which the French could agree, stating that <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> did not want trouble over the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study at the Ministerial
                        meeting. During this private meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> appeared to be considerably more forthcoming with
                        regard to what the French would accept than in his presentation to the
                        Special Group. He indicated that France could support the work proposals
                        made in the Watson-Scheutz report (East-West Relations) and the <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> report (Future Security Policy of
                        the Alliance), and perhaps also the proposal for a Mediterranean study—in
                        effect, the work program on which the other allies expressed general
                        agreement, as mentioned above.</p>
                    <p>The French undoubtedly felt obliged to go along with the proposed procedure
                        for drafting a report in the face of the unexpected strength and near
                        unanimity of the positions of their NATO allies at this meeting, including
                        those who previously have sought to appease the French on these questions.
                        The French desire and purpose undoubtedly is still to scuttle or severely
                        weaken the results of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        Study. However, the general agreement evidenced among the other NATO allies
                        concerning the need for positive results from the exercise presents the
                        French with the risk of over-playing their hand.</p>
                    <p>Prospects. Notwithstanding the private declarations by <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> that France might be able to accept
                        what appears to be the agreed conclusions of the rest of the Alliance
                        members, the French can be expected to continue to test the resolve of the
                        Fourteen, probing for weaknesses as regards support for an increased
                        political role for the Alliance, and taking advantage of any divisions which
                        might appear in order to press for a minimal declaration regarding the
                        future tasks of the Alliance. The Fourteen still face the difficult task of
                        agreeing to words which capture what seems to be an emerging consensus
                        regarding worthwhile results for the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Study and yet do not offend the many sensitivities,
                        French and otherwise, uncovered by this year-long exercise. This game can be
                        expected to continue up to and through the December Ministerial meeting.
                        However, if the Fourteen are able to maintain their present solidarity on
                        the consensus reached at the November 7 meeting, the French will find it
                        difficult to make a convincing case, particularly in the public media, in
                        opposition to an increased NATO role in the expansion of East-West detente
                        and the promotion of disarmament and arms control.</p>

                    <p>71659. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Under Secretary Rostow called
                        in French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> on November
                        15 for an exchange of views on current status <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study on future tasks of Alliance. In review of
                        exercise since its inception, Rostow made following points: </p>
                    <p>1. It was only after his talks with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                            Murville</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> in
                        fall of 1966 that United States decided to support <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> initiative. US did this on basis
                        these officials indicated that France was not opposed in principle to going
                        ahead with political consultation in NATO.</p>
                    <p>2. This indication was subsequently confirmed by France's approval at last
                        December's Ministerial session of the decision calling for the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study.</p>
                    <p>3. US has consistently been careful to take into account positions of all our
                        allies vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study and
                        will continue to be sensitive to these considerations.</p>
                    <p>4. November 7–8 Special Group meeting in Brussels indicated a growing
                        consensus on objectives of <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        study. While there was not a complete meeting of minds on all details at
                        this session, there was general support on the desirability and necessity
                        for Alliance consultation in three areas in particular: European security
                        including the German question, disarmament, and the Mediterranean area.</p>
                    <p>5. On basis of talks with <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> in
                        Brussels it was his understanding that the French were not opposed but
                        favored political consultation on these three subjects, and that while there
                        might be questions of nuance and of defining the terms of reference for such
                        consultation, there should be no difficulty in gaining agreement on language
                        in December Ministerial communique re general concept of political
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>6. In this connection, US has always stressed its desire to increase
                        political consultation in NATO, but is seeking no new commitments by any
                        ally and does not contemplate any “integrated political command structure”
                        in the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>7. After seeking instructions to get over procedural impasse on report of
                        Special Group, <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> had asked for
                        his help on report to be submitted at December Ministerial as <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> hoped to avoid trouble. Specifically,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> hoped US would sacrifice
                        rhetoric for substance. Rostow agreed.</p>
                    <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0671"/>
                    <p>8. As we are now preparing for Special Group session on November 22 which
                        will consider <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> draft, he hoped
                        to have further bilateral talks with <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> in order to avoid difficulties later. He therefore
                        wondered if <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> had any
                        comments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> said that he hoped to obtain
                        instructions before Rostow's departure on November 20. He then asked about
                        disposition and status of four studies considered by Special Group, noting
                        that France had already objected to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> and Patijn studies.</p>
                    <p> Rostow replied that these papers had no governmental status, were only
                        working papers prepared by individuals for consideration by Special Group,
                        and would be transmitted without endorsement to the Ministers. He added that
                        US had not taken a position on any of these studies and did not plan to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>In an aside to Anderson, <gloss target="#t_FBX1">FBX</gloss>, after meeting,
                            <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> said he hoped we “would not

                        as Paris would react negatively to any attempt to institutionalize
                        consultation in areas we have in mind.</p>

                    <p>594. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subject: Meeting of Special
                        Group on Future of Alliance—Profile.</p>
                    <p>1. Strong hands were laid on from several sides during the November 22
                        meeting in Brussels of the Special Group on the Future of the Alliance
                            (<persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise), with the
                        result that (A) the broad consensus on key issues which began to take form
                        in subgroup sessions has begun to be converted into Alliance doctrine, (B)
                        confronted by this momentum, France appears to have made decision that it
                        prefers the embarrassment of compromises to the risk of rejection, (C) the
                        exercise has evidently been a soul-searching experience for at least half of
                        the Allies, presumably accounting for their resolution and France's
                        appreciation of <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0672"/>it, and (D) there
                        is emerging a rather firmly-stated report, supported moreover by the
                        considerable body of legislative history which the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise has written. Hardly less
                        important is the fact that allies are now generally viewing the emerging
                        report as source of some form of public document. Principal segments of
                        opinion which have emerged within this profile are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>2. An important factor in keeping the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise on a route headed toward a (public) report
                        has been determination on the part of Denmark and Norway to see to it that
                        the Alliance produces a persuasive contemporary statement of its rationale.
                        They frankly acknowledge their concern is rooted in domestic political
                        needs. While the two countries have been out in front in this respect, it
                        has become clear that concern about educating member country public,
                        particularly youth, is very widely shared among Allied governments. The
                        public relations aim shared by these governments is to present to their
                        publics explicit answers to the sort of politically-charged questions
                        Alliance diplomats have been skirting for many months. Faced with this
                        widespread interest in finding common answers to deliver publicly, French
                            <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> fell back to simply quibbling
                        about language for making such points as: the international situation has
                        changed significantly, but not fundamentally; the Alliance must maintain and
                        develop its military capability to assure a balance of forces and thus a
                        climate of stability; security and detente are not contradictory, but
                        complementary; detente cannot thrive in disorder; collective defense is a
                        stabilizing factor in world politics; the Alliance and the solidarity it
                        involves serves to promote detente in Europe. As evidence of the importance
                        Denmark and Norway attach to this aspect of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise, Foreign Ministry Under Secretaries from
                        both countries (Paludan and Jacobsen) participated actively in the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>3. UK Minister of State Mulley was a hard task master to those who wished to
                        bypass a report or diffuse the product. In terms of confrontation of
                        personalities, Mulley probably made it clearer than anyone else to <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> that French field of maneuver in
                        trying to wear down the exercise was narrow indeed. Fog at both ends of the
                        air lane restrained Mulley from returning to Brussels November 23. He did
                        his share November 22, however, to convince <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> that the wisest course to take was to jump into the
                        drafting himself and salvage what he could of the French viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName>'s behavior during the
                        meeting is enduring, it means in effect that France looked at the
                        alternatives in this instance, discovered that the year-long exercise had
                        exposed and pointed up national interests to such an extent that some of the
                        usual wells of sympathy for French obstinacy had run dry. Scandinavian
                        preoccupation with the public dimension (discussed above), joined
                        prominently by Canada and Belgium, <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0673"/>and supported by the US and UK, and careful <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> concern for the essentials of European security provided
                        little room for a totally negative French position. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> was much too wise then to try to
                        convert the Allies from any of the hard convictions formed into words during
                        recent weeks about the need, nature and purpose of the Alliance. Instead he
                        entered energetically into the drafting, to do all he could to erase the
                        impression that the report was a refutation of Gaullism foreign policy.
                        Where he insisted most vigorously, the problem usually had to do with the
                        need to eradicate a term anathema in Gaullist doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> managed a difficult task with skill
                        and good humor.</p>
                    <p>5. Canada and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> were prominent among those
                        countries which apparently concluded during recent weeks that the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise could not just terminate in
                        empty space and that if there was to be a report, it had better be an
                        acceptable product in terms of their national concerns. For this, Canadian
                            <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Campbell made it clear that
                        Canada, like Denmark and Norway, needed a sound rationale of the Alliance to
                        gain public appreciation, and the stress of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s interventions was to point
                        up the need the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> sees in keeping
                        established Alliance doctrine from unravelling.</p>
                    <p>7. [sic] Reference to the flank countries in the <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> draft provoked a demurrer from Norway (supported by
                        Denmark) and precipitated sharp contrast between northern and southern flank
                        sentiments. Norwegian Under Secretary Jacobsen urged the Alliance not to
                        refer to defense problems of the flanks in a document likely to be made
                        public. However, Turkish <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Birgi
                        and Greek <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> Cavalierato were
                        inclined to insist on a reference to the defense problems on their flank;
                        special reference to Mediterranean (with bow to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction in Mideast) has survived.</p>
                    <p>8. Meeting was enlivened considerably by Belgian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>, who objected to the inadequate
                        treatment rendered in the <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> draft
                        to inter-Allied relations. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        observed that peace in Western Europe owes much to the multiple means which
                        have brought about solidarity, and it is explicit in Articles I and II of
                        the Treaty that the Alliance is designed to play a role as a stabilizing
                        influence drawing together Western nations. <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> made the point eloquently that this role of
                        preserving peace within the area needed reaffirmation.</p>
                    <p>9. Italian <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> De Ferrariis made a
                        strong bid for enlarging the terms of reference and expanding the time frame
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise, a hardened
                        variation of the Italian theme about postponing the reporting process. De
                        Ferrariis cited three salient omissions from the present study (A) the
                        “legal structure,” by which he said he meant the change from obligatory to
                        discretionary membership after 1969, (B) <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, on which he thought answers were needed about possible effects
                        on the Alliance on East-West balance, on the significance of nonratification
                        by some, and on <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0674"/>the possibility of
                        extending the nuclear cover of the Alliance pending implementation of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and (C) <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and their repercussions on the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>10. As for U.S. Delegation, we have naturally taken a good deal of leadership
                        behind the scenes and around the edges, but participation at Special Group
                        Nov 22 and drafting committee Nov 23 has been very widely shared, and it has
                        been comparatively easy not to overdo it.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Ferri said that he was grateful to have the opportunity to meet with a
                        senior Department official responsible for the conduct of U.S. relations
                        with Europe. He was interested in hearing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s views on the problem of British entry into the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The French position on the British
                        application for membership was a problem of deepest concern both to Italy
                        and to his party.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said that we very much
                        regret the situation which has arisen with regard to the British
                        application. He said that we favor British entry and feel that Britain has a
                        natural role to play in Europe. Her entry into the Common Market would
                        strengthen the Community politically and her technology would be a
                        considerable asset. Although we have <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0675"/>long supported British entry, we have decided that it would not be useful
                        to proclaim this policy from the roof tops. It is felt that such action on
                        our part would be counterproductive as it could be used to support the
                        Gaullist contention that British entry into the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would serve as the Trojan horse for the United States. It
                        is our impression that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> has taken an extremely harsh position. Although he has
                        not yet used the word veto, he has as much as said that he will not permit
                        British entry.<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">At his press conference on
                            November 27, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> stated
                            that the United Kingdom might one day be eligible for membership if it
                            underwent “vast and very deep” changes, which might come about through
                            some kind of associate membership.</note> We feel that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s attitude of waiting to
                        hear from the Six rather than accepting <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s response is correct and sensible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> asked Mr. Ferri if he
                        would elaborate on his views of the subject. Mr. Ferri said that the Five
                        were presented with an impossible dilemma. No one knew just how far
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would go in blocking
                        the British bid, but it would certainly be as far as the Five would allow
                        him. The dilemma which the Five face is whether to push for UK entry, thus
                        risking the destruction of the Community or to capitulate to the General.
                        Neither alternative was palatable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said that hopefully UK
                        membership could be achieved after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s departure from the scene. He would hope that Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and the UK would keep
                        up the momentum for entry during the interim. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> had already demonstrated that there was no
                        alternative to full membership and that neither <gloss target="#t_NAFTA1">NAFTA</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> offered valid
                        alternatives. Fortunately, <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>
                        appeared to have the support of both parties in the UK. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Ferri said that the ultimate solution to the impasse was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s “departure for another
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>Minister Terruzzi said that he was not completely convinced that the
                        situation in France after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        would necessarily favor major changes in French policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ferri said it was important to note the subtle shades of opinion in
                        France. He pointed out that Giscard d'Estaing was opposed to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on certain issues and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> generally received
                        support from the Communists on foreign policy issues.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said that it is hard to
                        foresee exactly what would happen after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and that much depended upon how he goes. It was, of
                        course, a mistake to assume that everything would change upon his departure.
                        For example, French refusal to participate in the NATO unified military
                        command structure would most probably not be altered. On the question of
                        European integration and British entry, however, there might well be some
                        changes.</p>

                    <p>After replying to the Foreign Minister's words of welcome, the Secretary said
                        that he did not expect any special difficulties for this session. The
                        Foreign Minister said that such difficulties as there were could probably be
                        overcome. In as far as the preparation of the work plans for the Alliance is
                        concerned, it seems probable that the language between brackets is
                        negotiable. Even if the French do not accept the removal of all of the
                        brackets, the basic positions are clearly enough expressed elsewhere so that
                        the Fourteen can live with the report even if the bracketed portions of it
                        are deleted. Secondly, once this question is settled, it seems that the
                        report may be agreed by some kind of consensus such as through a statement
                        by the Secretary General that he hears no objections.</p>
                    <p>Such a procedure, however, would be acceptable to the French only if it is
                        understood that the report itself will remain confidential. Of course, no
                        one expects that leaks will not occur; the French understand this but will
                        be satisfied if no formal statement of endorsement is made public.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that the important point was to have a common text of
                        the 15 nations and that this was more important than the specific language.
                        The major difficulty is more likely to occur in connection with the
                        annex.</p>
                    <p>Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> mentioned that it may
                        be important to give expression to the role of the Alliance in the pursuit
                        of a detente. If this is <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0677"/>not done,
                        some of the member nations—particularly the Danes—may be faced with internal
                        difficulties with both public and parliament. This type of difficulty is
                        precisely contrary to that experienced by the French delegation in regards
                        to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Italy also may
                        find it difficult to come to a conclusion of the work of the Special
                        Committee before her next elections, since such conclusions might appear to
                        tie the hands of a future government and therefore be resented. The Italian
                        socialists have been for 15 years the allies of the communists and had taken
                        a stand against the Alliance. Too brusque a reversal of their policy might
                        be difficult.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that should the Italians be embarrassed by language
                        specifying that conclusions have been reached and would prefer the concept
                        that the work is continuing, this should be easy since the work of the
                        governing bodies of the Alliance is never finished; it may simply continue
                        within the Council rather than within the Special Group. In point of fact,
                        many of the participating nations did not send special representatives to
                        the Special Group but designated their permanent representatives.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister suggested that the two delegations keep in close touch
                        in following developments. He said that he would like to make clear certain
                        political difficulties faced by the European members of the Alliance; while
                        applying only secondarily to Belgium, they were not without relevance here.
                        Many, if not most, European members of the Alliance have to face
                        parliamentary opposition which is vigorous on the part of the communists and
                        half-hearted on the part of the socialists. This is why it is often
                        necessary to disarm socialist opposition (and thus isolate the communists)
                        by attributing to the Alliance a role in the pursuit of detente. This fits
                        with President Johnson's speech of October 7. This is not an absolute
                        necessity today for Belgium since the government coalition does not include
                        the socialists. However, we must think of future political realignments and
                        Belgium, as the seat of the Alliance, must remain internally stable. The
                        manner in which the conclusions regarding the future of the Alliance are
                        made public is not too important but the result must be achieved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to make two points concerning the United
                        States position in regard to NATO. First of all, a question of public
                        opinion: the man-on-the-street is becoming angry at General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>; because of misinformation he may
                        come to associate all of Europe with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>. Until now, both President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and the Secretary had followed a policy of not
                        replying to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. This
                        may be the wiser course of action but it does not help show public opinion
                        that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and Europe are
                        separate and distinct. We are now under severe pressure in Congress to bill
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0678"/>the costs of NATO's relocation. There are
                        even some persons who speak now about asking France to repay World War I
                        debts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to make his second point: many of the European allies
                        of the United States do not realize that the present position of the United
                        States amounts to a near miracle. More than a half million Americans are
                        involved in Southeast Asia, most of them in combat. In spite of that, the
                        United States is maintaining its forces in Europe. The willingness of the
                        American people to bear the cost, both financial and moral, of such burdens
                        is perhaps taken too much for granted. In this connection, any revision
                        downward of NATO force commitments of other allies could create a chain
                        reaction. For example, the change in the Belgian force levels is not a
                        purely Belgian affair but may have repercussions throughout the Alliance and
                        in particular may make it more difficult for the President and the Secretary
                        to defend present U.S. commitments to NATO.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister congratulated the President and the Secretary of State
                        for their courage in refraining from entering into polemics with General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. As far as Belgium is
                        concerned, contemplated restructuring of her forces amounts to an actual
                        strengthening. In the first place, Belgium intends to maintain her defense
                        expenditures at the present level in terms of percentage of GNP. To do this
                        she is ready to increase the military budget by an increment up to, but not
                        exceeding, 4% a year. Secondly, changes will be made only after consultation
                        with her partners. Do Belgium's allies prefer more numerous Belgian forces
                        existing largely on paper only or a smaller well-equipped and well-trained
                        army? “It's up to the generals to decide.” He expressed the hope, however,
                        that the Alliance will accept the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss>'s
                        proposals.</p>

                        entry to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The question of British entry
                        to the European Communities was the principal point of discussion between
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> at lunch December 12. Others
                        present were Hood, O'Neill and Maitland on the UK side and <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SGSJ1">Springsteen</persName>
                        for US.</p>
                    <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0679"/>
                    <p>Principal thrust of British presentation was that the British wanted the Five
                        in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to push at December 18–19 <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Council meeting for a definitive position on
                        the question of undertaking negotiations (as contrasted with definitive
                        decision on membership).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said that the UK position was
                        eroding. Further inconclusiveness would cause only further erosion and a
                        turning away of Britain from Europe. He stressed he was devoted to the goal
                        of British entry into the Communities for both economic and political
                        reasons but felt that he as a politician was “out” if he could not produce
                        some forward momentum.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, he wanted a definitive decision at the December 18–19 meeting. If
                        it was negative, Britain would then proceed to show its continued interest
                        in Europe by working with willing European countries in the economic,
                        political, defense, and technological fields. He said that this could be
                        with the Five, or three, or two or even one. (He was not specific on the
                        details of these alternatives but at one point alluded to suggestions for
                        strengthening <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and for cooperative work
                        in field of armaments.)</p>
                    <p>If the answer from the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Council meeting was
                        positive, they would proceed to negotiations.</p>
                    <p>He also made it clear that he believed France was susceptible to pressure
                        from the Five and felt that, if pressed, the French will agree to
                        negotiations. He said, however, that some of his staff (O'Neill) did not
                        share this view.</p>
                    <p>He stated flatly that anything short of straight negotiations was not
                        acceptable. Talks by the UK with the Commission looking to resolving
                        problems prior to outright negotiations, were not an acceptable substitute
                        because they were not with the principals in the Community and could further
                        erode the UK negotiation position by leading to a premature sacrificing of
                        some issues important to UK.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussion he indicated that the need for a decision
                        whether pro or con next week was being broached by him in his talks with the
                        Five. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> was particularly strong in
                        commending <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>'s tactic. <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> was very firm in support of
                        negotiations but <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> was toying
                        with unacceptable compromise suggestions.</p>
                    <p>He urged Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to adopt a
                        similarly firm line in his bilateral discussions with the Five here in
                        Brussels.</p>
                    <p>The US side seriously questioned the <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> approach, noting that it was forcing the Five into a
                        confrontation with the French with possible repercussions on the
                        Communities, moreover, grave doubts were cast on <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>'s belief that the Five could, in his words, force
                        Couve “to turn up his card”. The US side expressed the view that time was on
                        the UK side and it was best to let the matter proceed for the time in a
                        manner the Five deemed best. To force a likely negative decision could not
                        produce the <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0680"/>same positive results
                        as following a perhaps slow but determined route toward entry. In this
                        context, it was mentioned that talks with the Commission could have value
                        and maintain momentum, and should be looked at carefully. A historical note
                        was sounded by citing past UK errors in dealing with the Common Market and
                        the hope was expressed that such errors would not be repeated again.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> declined to accept the vigorous
                        US presentation, noting that the lack of a decision on negotiations would
                        only result in further deterioration of support for entry in the UK and the
                        UK turning its back on Europe. Whether a “yea” or “nay” answer would mean
                        progress; the former meaning negotiation and the latter the pursuit of
                        alternatives with interested Europeans. He urged the Secretary again to
                        support him.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary indicated doubt as to the wisdom of <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>'s proposed course, saying it was doubtful the Five
                        could be brought to such a decision. However, he said he would talk with his
                        colleagues in the Five to see what their views were on the negotiating
                        problem.</p>

                    <p>1. Although partly overshadowed by Greek crisis, NATO Ministerial results
                        satisfactory in terms of (A) resolution of specific issues; and (B) general
                            atmosphere.<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">U.S. Delegation records of the

                        both the military and political issues, agreement was reached on all major
                        subjects <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0681"/>where Ministerial action
                        had been indicated. Possibilities of impasse or open disagreements inherent
                        in the situation (between the Fourteen and France on the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study and between the US and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on strategic concepts) were avoided without
                        any significant loss to US objectives.</p>
                    <p>2. On defense issues, results already summed up in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> A. An important additional point to be stressed is that
                        new force planning and nuclear consultation machinery established by NATO
                        members last Dec has successfully completed its first full cycle. Whatever
                        problems remain—and there are some difficult ones—the Fourteen now have in
                        being a set of institutional arrangements enabling them realistically to tie
                        together nuclear and conventional strategy, force planning and available
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to action on firm force commitments for 1968, on five-year
                        force plan, and on “flexible response” strategy, <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> session included several other points of interest to us.
                        Various Ministers highlighted Mediterranean security problem in their
                        statements, and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> review of the
                        international situation provided additional underpinning for future work on
                        this subject. US is also gratified at widespread support that made possible
                        agreement on establishment of standing naval force under <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> (multinational destroyer
                        force).</p>
                    <p>4. While Secretary made his major statement in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> (see <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>),<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">Telegram 1038, Secto 40, December 14. (Department of
                            State, Central Files, NATO 3 BEL(BR))</note> we wish to call attention
                        to two significant US statements in <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>
                        which merit careful reading. First is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s “valedictory” presented by Deputy Secretary
                        Nitze. Second is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
                        brief statement on burden-sharing and NATO claims against France. (Texts of
                        both statements transmitted to addressee posts.)</p>
                    <p>5. Main item of business for the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>—and most
                        highly publicized subject for Ministerial sessions as a whole—was <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study, outcome is reported in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> B. The full agreement reached on text
                        of the report, embracing both a set of agreed principles and work program
                        for political consultations, is highly satisfactory to us. We, like number
                        of other countries, would have preferred greater detail on a number of
                        points in line with Rapporteurs' studies. Fact is, however, that despite
                        hard negotiations between Fourteen and France at Special Group and in
                        Brussels this week, our essential needs are met substantively and
                        presentationally. France undoubtedly went along in part because of
                        solidarity among key members of Fourteen, but existence of UK/<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> problem may also have played important
                        role, French not wanting to add new NATO dispute to UK/Common Market
                        dispute.</p>
                    <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0682"/>
                    <p>6. As the Secretary indicated in the meeting, US considers that the value of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Exercise goes beyond the
                        report itself. We believe the analytical process carried out this year has
                        had great utility in clarifying Alliance thinking; in bringing the members
                        closer together on some fundamental propositions, and in laying out agreed
                        framework for future political consultations. We also attach considerable
                        importance to the agreement to publish the report.</p>
                    <p>7. In a sense, analogy can be made between <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> report this December and decisions taken on defense
                        matters last December which established tasks for future implementation. The
                        big problem now is to begin carrying out the Alliance's political work
                        program.</p>
                    <p>8. Methods, timing and order of priorities for followup work, as between
                        East-West relations, arms control and disarmament, Mediterranean security,
                        and world-wide issues all remain to be sorted out. There is also question of
                        any additional subjects Italy may raise in the Permanent Council under
                        compromise worked out in order to overcome Italian reservation on concluding
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study now. (Part of
                        earlier Italian reserve based in part on expressed desire NATO consultation
                        on security implications for Western Europe of such issues as <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s.)</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> pointed out in meetings that
                        it would be up to each member country to interpret <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study results for its own public
                        opinion. We recommend addressees bear in mind hope expressed by Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that, in public presentation
                        of <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study findings, member
                        governments portray them as indication of future confidence in the
                            Alliance.<note n="5" xml:id="d281fn5">Intelligence Note No. 1006,

                    <p>In the course of a long talk at his initiative about the Middle East and NATO
                        at a reception last week, Ambassador Dobrynin proposed that we have lunch
                        soon, to carry the discussion forward. The lunch took place today.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent NATO Meeting.</p>
                    <p> Dobrynin asked what I thought the NATO Ministerial meeting had accomplished.
                        I replied that in our view it was a step towards peace—towards further
                        efforts to improve political relations in Europe. He smiled and said, “Yes,
                        but how?”</p>
                    <p>I went on that as we saw it, the Allies wanted to take initiatives towards
                        detente, both in the political field, and, if possible, in the field of arms
                        control and disarmament. I recalled that the President had suggested mutual
                        and balanced force reductions in October 1966. Dobrynin said that had been
                        noted. Why didn't we go back to the idea of our taking a step, which they
                        might then follow. We had had such an understanding earlier about military
                        budgets. Then, after several reductions, we had increased our budget without
                        telling them. This had left a bad impression. But he thought that if we
                        reduced forces, that could lead to something. They had no objections to our
                        forces in Europe, but they thought they were unnecessarily large. Why did we
                        think six divisions were necessary? I replied that all sorts of things could
                        happen, as they had in the past. We thought a strong conventional troop
                        presence reduced the risk of nuclear confrontation. Dobrynin remarked that
                        that was appreciated.</p>
                    <p>“Was the NATO decision,” he asked, “an operational decision or a statement of
                        intent? Are we expected to respond now?” I replied that a positive response
                        on their part would be welcomed at any time, but on the whole we regarded
                        the Resolution as a statement of policy, which would be followed up in due
                        course by a number of specific proposals.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the military side, Dobrynin asked why we thought a new combined

                    <p>The December 18–19 meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European
                        Communities (<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>) concentrated its attention
                        almost exclusively on the British application for entry into the Common
                        Market. The principal result was a reconfirmation of the French “pocket
                        veto,” although no formal vote was taken on the question. The chagrin and
                        disappointment evidenced particularly by the Dutch and the Belgians may
                        cause some slowdown of normal Community activities, but such a slowdown is
                        not likely to endure long into the New Year. It is not expected that the
                        continued French success in blocking negotiations on <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> membership for the British will lead to any serious split in
                        the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Preliminaries</hi>. France's action at this latest
                        meeting of the Council of Ministers is a logical culmination of the
                        positions which that country has taken since the British renewed their bid
                        in May. President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, in press
                        conferences on May 16 and November 27, made no secret of his attitude.
                        Britain was not yet judged to be economically healthy enough for admission,
                        the role of sterling as a reserve currency was incompatible with <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> membership, and there would have to be
                        profound changes in Britain's social and political “nature” before it would
                        be sufficiently European, if admitted, not to endanger the viability of the
                        Common Market. <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0685"/>At the October 23–24

                            paper is ibid.]</note> French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>, noting that France had
                        no objection in principle to British entry, nevertheless said that the
                        question of new members had to be studied in depth. He raised the problems
                        of the UK balance of payments deficit and the role of sterling and called
                        for solutions to both as necessary preconditions even to negotiations.</p>
                    <p>With the one exception of France, the other Common Market members were agreed
                        that, as recommended in the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Commission
                        report of September 29, 1967, negotiations should be opened with the British
                        (and the Irish, Danes, and Norwegians) to see whether solutions could be
                        found to the problems involved in their membership applications. Given the
                        known French position, it is doubtful whether either the UK or the “Friendly
                        Five” seriously expected that the French could be brought to accept
                        negotiations. But the UK Foreign Office made clear that the British expected
                        a formal reply to their application from the Community as a whole. Further,
                        in public statements and private conversations, British officials repeatedly
                        emphasized that the UK application was for full membership and that any form
                        of association—which the French hinted might be a suitable compromise—was
                        unacceptable. The British also did all they could to encourage the five
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> members favorable to their cause to
                        stand firm. In particular, the British devoted attention to stiffening the
                        attitude of the Germans, who were obviously in a key position to influence
                        the French, if anyone was. As one observer noted, “the Dutch could make a
                        row, but only the Germans could make a crisis.”</p>
                    <p>It has been clear for some time, however, that the Germans were not going to
                        make a crisis. Because of broader foreign policy considerations the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> government, in this as
                        in other matters, wanted to avoid a head-on collision with the French. The
                        German Foreign Office emphasized in December that Germany would not
                        contemplate negotiations between Britain and the Five, and that Germany
                        would not be willing to employ specific pressure to change the French
                        position on negotiations with the British. For this reason, the major issue
                        on December 18–19 was not whether negotiations would be authorized but what
                        posture the Five would assume in face of, and after, the French veto. Thus,
                        the Five agreed at a meeting on December 14 that their best tactic at the
                        December 18–19 session would be to press for a clear discussion and a clear
                        reply to the British, i.e., a formal French veto. The Five's tactic
                        coincided with the British wish to force the issue on the principle of
                        membership, perhaps with the idea that, with this in the record, it might be
                        easier some day to reopen the issue at Brussels.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0686"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">The December 18–19 Meeting</hi>. The Five thus entered the
                        Brussels meeting probably well aware of the fact that they would not obtain
                        approval of any form of negotiations with the British. They hoped, however,
                        to isolate the French by forcing them in a formal vote to veto negotiations
                        on the British application. In this hope they were disappointed.</p>
                    <p>A December 11–12 Council meeting had heard a report from the Commission on
                        the UK devaluation of November 18, and its hoped-for results in improving
                        the British balance of payments. Nevertheless, at the December 18–19
                        meeting, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> insisted
                        that the question of negotiating British entry could not even be considered
                        until the health of the British economy had been demonstrably reestablished.
                        In the long run the British might be able to overcome their difficulties,
                        said <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>, but they are not now
                        ready for membership, and to permit their entry would be dangerous for the
                        Community. Moreover, to enter into long-drawn-out negotiations would freeze
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> progress.</p>
                    <p>The other five Foreign Ministers argued variously for acceptance of the
                        Commission's recommendation and “negotiations now!” <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, for example, argued for a parallel
                        progress in negotiations and British economic recovery. In the end, however,
                        there was no vote, there was no formal veto, and the communique, subscribed
                        to by all six, was rather bland for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>The communique ending the meeting, in language provided by the German
                        Chairman, Minister of Economics Schiller, provided a seven-point summary
                        record of the session. The principal points were: that no member objected in
                        principle to the enlargement of the Common Market, although one member
                        believed that enlargement would modify profoundly the nature of the
                        Community; that all member states believed that the economic recovery of the
                        UK was an essential precondition for its membership, although several member
                        states (probably Italy and Benelux) did not believe that recovery needed to
                        be complete prior to entry; that five member states shared the Commission's
                        view that negotiations with Britain should begin, although one member state
                        believed that the UK economic recovery had to be completed in order that its
                        application be considered; that, as a result, no agreement had been reached
                        on opening negotiations, and the Council's Chairman had been charged with so
                        informing the interested countries; and that the applications for membership
                        would remain on the Council's agenda. Although no countries were identified
                        by name in the communique, there is little question as to where each country
                        stood.</p>
                    <p>An eighth point, that the operations of the Community would proceed normally,
                        was eliminated at the request of Italy and Benelux. It was the least they
                        could do, but the deletion committed no one to any action. Despite the
                        wishes of the Friendly Five, it would seem that the communique did a better
                        job of highlighting the poor state of the British economy <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0687"/>than of conspicuously and unequivocally
                        drawing attention to the isolation of France.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Immediate Reaction to the Pocket Veto</hi>. Resignation
                        mingled with annoyance and, in some cases, indignation toward the French
                        seems to be the prevailing reaction among the Friendly Five. The Dutch
                        member walked out of a meeting of the Common Market's Agricultural
                        Ministers, causing the German Chairman to suspend the session. A meeting of
                        Labor Ministers was cancelled at the request of the Dutch and Belgians, and
                        the Dutch representative did not attend a meeting of the six Social Affairs
                        Ministers. The Belgians have decided not to take part in future debates
                        pending a “final policy decision” next year. (The next meeting of the
                        Permanent Representatives is scheduled for February 4–5. It is interesting
                        to note that for the first half of 1968 the French will serve as chairmen of
                        the different meetings.) The Dutch plan not to participate in current
                        Ministerial meetings. Both the Dutch and the Belgians have stressed,
                        however, that their non-participation is not a boycott of the Common Market
                        meetings. It is not clear yet what the significance of these gestures may
                        turn out to be.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the end of the Council meeting, the Five met in a rump
                        session, but apparently decided on nothing except increased common action
                        with the UK. Details are vague, and these consultations will probably turn
                        out to be no more significant than the stratagem of semi-annual <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meetings adopted after France's 1963 veto.
                        If talks with the British do develop, however, they are evidently intended
                        largely to relate to matters outside of the Common Market's jurisdictional
                        area.</p>
                    <p>The British could hardly have been surprised at the turn of events in
                        Brussels. Following the end of the meeting, Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> announced that the British application
                        still stood, that the British did not intend to withdraw it, and that the UK
                        now proposed to enter into consultations with the five <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> members that favored negotiations. Informal
                        consultations between the British and the Five may indeed take place, but
                        they will almost certainly not be institutionalized. In face of the British
                        rejection of anything but full membership, it is difficult to know how any
                        talk of compromise can take place, but it is likely that, as time passes,
                        association possibilities will be at least discussed.</p>
                    <p>There has been some talk of retaliation by the Five against the French which
                        might take the form of blocking further progress in the Common Agricultural
                        Policy (France is said to be the largest single beneficiary of the Guidance
                        and Guarantee Fund) or preventing renewal of the Yaounde Convention which
                        expires in mid-1969 (most of the members of the Convention and recipients of
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> aid are former French colonies). But
                        the policies and programs of the communities are now seemingly so
                        inextricably interrelated that it is hard to imagine that this will happen,
                        though of course intra-community bargaining on these matters may be <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0688"/>more fierce than ever. The
                        Commission, although regretting the Council's failure to reach agreement and
                        urging a resumption of the movement “temporarily abandoned” toward expansion
                        of the Community, has appealed “to all concerned to keep the consequences of
                        the present disagreement within the narrowest possible limits.” This seems a
                        far cry from President <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s
                        pre-Council talk of crisis.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, a <hi rend="italic">German</hi> government spokesman said the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plans to work to keep the Community
                        functioning despite the UK problem, for, according to him, the process of
                        consolidation and development of the Community must not be made dependent on
                        British entry. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> just prior to
                        the conclusion of the Brussels meeting that the basic German tactic will be
                        to seek a solution in stages which will take care of political requirements
                        and UK prestige, and that the whole matter is one for compromise. This is
                        entirely consist-ent with previously known German attitudes. The Dutch have
                        been considered perhaps the only ones among the Five with the courage to
                        challenge <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> frontally on this
                        issue. But they are also realists, and our Embassy in The Hague believes
                        that there would be considerable reluctance even in The Netherlands to
                        generate a crisis. The Belgians have shown unusual spirit lately vis-a-vis
                        the French, but appear to be resigned to the fact of the French veto. A
                        high-ranking advocate of UK entry in the Belgian Foreign Ministry believes
                        that the Five have no choice but to accept the French veto or risk breaking
                        up the Community, and none, he thinks, will accept this risk. The Italians
                        face an election in the spring and do not want to be faced with a European
                        crisis at this time. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName>, in a statement in Rome, spoke obscurely in favor of
                        harmonizing action of the Five in favor of negotiations, and at the same
                        time cautioned against the temptation to act before reflecting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>. The sum of these attitudes seems to be
                        clear. The Five would like to see the UK enter the Communities, and would
                        like to begin immediate negotiations to explore the subject. But they all
                        appear to be aware, with varying degrees of resignation, that they have
                        neither the juridical nor the practical means to force the French government
                        to change what is obviously a fundamental aspect of its policy—the exclusion
                        of the UK. It is not probable that there will be a sustained, effective
                        attempt by them to retaliate within the Communities against France.
                        Presumably, then, negotiations on British entry into the Communities must
                        await the incumbency of a new French President. After the Brussels meeting
                        of December 18–19, there will probably be less tactical skirmishing around
                        the outskirts of this fact than there was in 1967.</p>

                        UK–6.</p>
                    <p>1. It is not clear to us from reftels whether German Government is still in
                        fact actively advocating association arrangement for the UK.</p>
                    <p>2. We believe it important to make clear to the Germans informally and
                        discreetly that an arrangement for the UK which does not in fact envisage
                        full membership by specific date in the near future would cause us serious
                        problems. An open-ended association arrangement for the UK with no guarantee
                        of membership would be a free trade area discriminating against American
                        exports without the compensating benefits of furthering greater political
                        unification in Europe which we continue favor. Such discriminatory
                        arrangements would be especially difficult for the Administration at this
                        time when protectionist sentiment is rampant in Congress and our balance of
                        payments is in the limelight of public attention.</p>
                    <p>3. We leave level of this informal representation to Embassy but would hope
                        that U.S. position would be registered with <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.
                        Perhaps <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>-Lahr level would be
                            appropriate.<note n="3" xml:id="d284fn3">On January 20, the Embassy
                            reported that these views had been made known to Lahr who replied that
                            he was aware of them, but insisted that something needed to be done to
                            keep the British application moving. (Telegram 7473 from Bonn;

                    <p>1. This is summary outcome of private <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        meeting January 17 on follow-up to <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> work program:</p>
                    <p>2. Full agreement, after mild Dutch grumbling, that upgraded <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>s, under <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as its own Steering Committee, is proper venue for European
                        security and German question. Special responsibilities of quadripartite four
                        explicitly recognized without disagreement. First step will be presentation
                        of proposed topics for study to be approved by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. General agreement these might well begin with analysis of
                        contemporary relevance of staff work done in 1958–60 period.</p>
                    <p>3. Similar agreement on institutional arrangements for general subject of
                        arms control and disarmament with disarmament experts group closely geared
                        to <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> follow-up work, beginning
                        with February session. Considerable sentiment for engaging experts group at
                        this session in consultations on future <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>s work program on this subject. Broad support, in a few
                        cases subject to approval in capitals, emerged for U.S. suggestion that one
                        of first topics for <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>s and experts
                        should be “after <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, what?” How to handle
                        mutual force reduction study put aside until French make up their minds
                        whether and how to participate, with <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> indicating he would have
                        answer by next week.</p>
                    <p>4. Discussion of Mediterranean degenerated into classical exercise in
                        obfuscation on scope of study (Mediterranean or Middle East), content of
                        study (military vs. political) and nature of discussion itself (procedural
                        vs. substantive). This after Italian PermRep de Ferrariis, without
                        instructions, rehashed trepidations about impinging on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> prerogatives vis-a-vis Middle East and
                        Seydoux warning of “complexity” and “delicacy” of whole subject. In end,
                        after <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> proposed special
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting as next step follow-on to
                        previous <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> briefing, group agreed to
                        meet again in two weeks to look at written text of updated <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> briefing, a paper which <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> undertook to produce, and any other
                        papers offered by delegations. If these papers are not available one week in
                        advance, meeting would be postponed another week. Purpose of that meeting
                        would be to determine whether substantive papers helped clarify unresolved
                        procedural issues.</p>
                    <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0691"/>
                    <p>4. In opening remarks <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> included
                        “other areas” as fourth item of work program. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> welcomed this, though U.S. has no specific
                        subjects to nominate at this time. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> intervened to plead French understanding that work
                        program limited to three subjects. Others pointed out members have inherent
                        right to raise any subject under this heading at any time under normal
                        consultative procedures. Discussion fizzled out in apparent recognition that
                        this is non-issue in practice.</p>

                            5:30 p.m., February 7, 1968</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>At <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s request, the President met
                        with the whole party rather than with <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> alone.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> expressed his pleasure in making
                        this first courtesy call on the President in his capacity as head of the
                        Commission of the combined <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0693"/>communities. He also expressed great satisfaction with his meetings
                        throughout the U.S. Government, and noted the importance of such meetings in
                        dealing with common problems.</p>
                    <p>He made three points in his presentation: </p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments and Trade Measures</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> congratulated the President on the
                        courageous action he had taken to deal with the U.S. balance of payments
                        program and on the President's strong opposition to protectionist pressures
                        which could endanger the Kennedy Round.</p>
                    <p>He said our balance of payments problem does not stem from our trade
                        account—which is in surplus. Measures to deal with the balance of payments,
                        therefore, should be taken in areas other than trade. He was worried that if
                        the U.S. took protectionist action, other countries would follow and
                        eventually the Community would have to move.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Crisis in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        </hi>—<persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> said the Commission deplored
                        existing obstacles to the admission of the United Kingdom to the
                        Communities. He said the Commission was determined to assure that close
                        contacts would be maintained, and that the Benelux memo was a good basis for
                        this. What measures the Five could or should take to cooperate with the UK
                        in outside fields is not yet decided. It was essential to find a reasonable
                        compromise on the UK issue and <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> was
                        optimistic one could be found within the next few months.</p>
                    <p>3. Cooperation with the U.S.—<persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>
                        pointed out that the Kennedy Round demonstrated how important it was for the
                        U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to reach agreement on
                        specific issues and how productive such agreement could be. The bargaining
                        was difficult but justified by the results. In the case of trade, the
                        Community could negotiate with the U.S. as an equal.</p>
                    <p>In the field of development, agreement between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> in trade policy toward developing countries
                        would provide a good basis for reaching wider agreement on the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> meeting in New Delhi.</p>
                    <p>Monetary matters and aid policy were also promising areas of continued
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> in his
                        capacity as Chairman of the merged Commission and thanked him for his
                        remarks. He also welcomed these consultations between the U.S. and the
                        Commission as a useful way of developing productive relations with the
                        Communities.</p>
                    <p>He reaffirmed U.S. support for the unity of Western Europe, and said it was
                        important that we work closely together on the balance of payments and in
                        other fields. Our overall problems were complex but, to a large degree,
                        solutions depended on how we handled economic issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> emphasized it was important that
                        we believe in what we were doing.</p>
                    <p>The President said we faced a difficult task ahead. We had to put our own
                        house in order and are prepared to do so. But we also need the cooperation
                            <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0694"/>of our friends. When we had a
                        surplus, we acted appropriately. We are now asking countries who are in a
                        surplus position to act in the same way.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> that the
                        U.S. and the European Communities must continue to work together in the
                        trade field, in monetary problems, in development policy, and in atomic
                        energy matters. He said we should also be able to share our experiences in
                        dealing with urban problems—which are becoming increasingly important and
                        common to all industrial countries.</p>
                    <p>Vice President Hellwig noted the possibilities for useful exchanges in
                        technology and research. He also referred to the advances being made in
                        European company laws and patents.</p>
                    <p>The President and <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> closed their
                        meeting by reviewing and agreeing on the proposed joint statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">For text of the Joint Statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:

                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Commission President <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s first official visit to Washington,
                        February 7–8 concentrated on <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> issue. We
                        achieved our primary objective of impressing on <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> and his party high priority we assign to restoring
                        equilibrium, relation this objective to broad political and security issues
                        and our view of responsibility of <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> surplus
                        countries. In course of meetings with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, these
                        points were made forcefully with stress on unfinished task of measures
                        necessary to improve our trade account. In meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s party and inter-agency group at Under
                        Secretary level, <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0695"/>chaired by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> which lasted 2–1/2
                        hours in two sessions (see <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>),<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">Not found. </note> U.S. presented rounded view of
                            <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> problem requiring <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> and Deniau were obviously impressed by seriousness of
                        the problem. We believe that as result his talks <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> appreciates political necessity for him to be
                        cooperative on trade side and recognizes role this can play in containing
                        protectionist pressures particularly as manifested in Congress. Since
                        Commission's powers limited with respect to economic expansion, interest
                        rate management and capital markets, measures in these fields were only
                        discussed in technical presentation and not in terms of action by the
                        Commission. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> also indicated little
                        likelihood <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> could take trade measures
                        benefiting U.S. trade account in short term. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> apparently sees his responsibility to consult with the
                        Commission and member countries on whether it will be possible for the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to stand still should the U.S. find it
                        necessary to take moderate action in trade field. He promised U.S. fairly
                        precise indication of the Commission's thinking when Trezise mission arrives
                        Brussels February 22.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> repeatedly stressed the
                        importance of achieving U.S. program in fiscal field (income tax surcharge)
                        in connection with obtaining European cooperation on <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss>. He also stressed need to maintain KR agreements and
                        specifically to abolish ASP. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_RWM2">Roth</persName> made clear that it would not be possible to wait until
                        after Congress acts on ASP before making a decision on <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> trade measures.</p>
                    <p>3. Other major U.S. substantive point concerned <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> discussed by Secretary, Chairman Seaborg, Messrs. Fisher
                        &amp; <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>. Messrs. Fisher and
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> impressed on <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> and his party need to begin informal
                        talks with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> responded Commission's objective was to facilitate
                        signature of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> by member countries not to
                        obstruct. He said Commission would seek negotiating mandate from Council of
                        Ministers at end of month. It was also agreed in meetings with Seaborg and
                        Fisher that it would be desirable have close contacts between U.S. and
                        Commission while informal talks were going on. On staff level, Foch
                        confirmed our earlier understanding from <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> that Commission staff's thinking on nature of
                        verification agreement well advanced.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s visit was relatively
                        uneventful with respect to UK-Six. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> stressed our opposition to association or free trade
                        area solution. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> on several
                        occasions said such solution not in cards because unacceptable to UK.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s main line on UK/Six issue
                        was that Communities have been in crisis since December 19 and he was
                        optimistic that in few months crisis would be on way to solution by some
                        major compromise as in 1964. Problem was to find adequate interim solution
                        for UK and three other applicants. Benelux proposals were acceptable
                        provided measures and activities contemplated thereunder would be within
                        Communities <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"/>framework. He repeated
                        several times his opposition to development of technological policy outside
                        Communities framework.</p>
                    <p>5. It is clear from what has been said above that <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s first visit was an occasion for significant worthwhile
                        discussions on substance. U.S. side, from President,<note n="3" xml:id="d288fn3">For a memorandum of President Johnson's conversation
                            with <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, see <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>. </note> Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officers to
                        staff level, made clear to <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> and his
                        party that U.S. looked to Commission and to European Communities for
                        important cooperation on <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> problem as well
                        as other economic problems, e.g., agriculture (see <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>).<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4">Telegram 113390 to Bonn, February 10. (Department of State, Central

                        <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> heard our views expressed at all
                        levels with a good deal of unanimity and singularity of purpose. We in turn
                        heard Commission views on a variety of important issues. Given the collegial
                        nature of the institution which he chairs, which in turn represents an
                        organization of six member countries with widely differing views, <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s response on <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> problem, while qualified and tentative, was remarkably
                        forthcoming. The forthcoming nature of his response was influenced by the
                        fact that he was deeply moved by the warmth of his reception. His
                        conversation with the President and the Vice President's luncheon and toast
                        in his honor were high points in this regard. But he was also influenced by
                        the fact that U.S. was actually asking Communities for cooperation in a
                        specific substantive area appealing not only to goodwill but to hard mutual
                        self interest.</p>
                    <p>6. Finally, ground work firmly laid for future consultations on highest level
                        as needed. The President told <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> he

                        Principle to hold U.S.-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> consultations as
                        needed in the future was incorporated in the Joint Statement<note n="5" xml:id="d288fn5">See <ref target="#d287fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        of visit <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> agreed that another subject for

                        before Yaounde Convention is renegotiated.</p>
                    <p>7. In sum, <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> was clearly pleased with
                        his visit. He clearly understands U.S. position and we believe he has
                        undertaken a rather difficult assignment with respect to his Commission and
                        member states. We, for our side, are pleased that his first visit as
                        President of the Commission went beyond reiteration of long-standing U.S.
                        positions on Atlantic partnership into specific useful discussion of what
                        such partnership means at the present time.</p>

                        our <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> presentation in most general terms.
                        Line we are taking in response to inquiries is that there was thorough
                        airing of the problem and <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>
                        indicated he would consult with Commission and member countries and give us

                        arrives in Brussels.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> outlined work now underway in
                        NATO on the political side—the search for a basis for European political
                        settlement, work on arms control and study of the new situation created by
                        Soviet penetration in the Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> stressed the need for continuing defense effort
                        within a period when we are looking forward to the possibility of
                        discussions with the Soviet Union about the future of Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was very clear on the need to maintain the level of
                        forces required to maintain effective deterrent in Europe. He referred to
                        the contrary views among the Senate leadership, but left no impression that
                        these affected his own determination. I suggested that there was a close
                        connection between the notion of seeking a balanced reduction of forces on
                        which NATO is now beginning to work, and the need to maintain an agreed
                        level of forces as a basis from which reductions might be calculated and
                        negotiated; otherwise the Soviet would not need to negotiate but merely need
                        to wait until the forces on our side melt away. The President expressed his
                        agreement with this line of argument <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0698"/>and with its relevance to discussions here this year on the Mansfield

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. NATO and European Security</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> replied to the
                        Ambassador's request for a review of current European developments with a
                        brief review of the <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> visit and
                        the renewed activity in NATO arising from the now-concluded <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> study. It appears there is not much
                        Soviet interest in mutual reduction of forces and that they are attempting
                        in general, to solidify the status quo and to gain <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognition. The Soviets continue to suggest European
                        participants only in any European security conference, but they would
                        probably agree in the end to our participation. Ambassador Lemberger said he
                        felt such a conference would not be useful at this time because it would
                        only lead to a reaffirmation of the status quo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> agreed and added that it also
                        raised the German question without prospect of settlement or progress. There
                        are other less spectacular steps which could be taken to lead to a reduction
                        of tension. We still see NATO as a necessary security element, but we feel
                        it can also be used as an instrument to reduce tension.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Economic Developments </p>
                    <p>Turning to European Community matters, Ambassador Lemberger said the results
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">February 15–16 at Paris.</note> were not clear, but he
                        was not optimistic that progress had been made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said it <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0699"/>appeared that France is upset at being
                        excluded by the Five and has decided it will participate in talks with the
                        British, although this does not mean any improvement in the likely result of
                        the talks—association, not membership, remains the offer to the British.
                        Ambassador Lemberger remarked that a trade agreement is easier to achieve
                        when the aim is merely a customs union and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> reminded him we could not welcome moves which led
                        merely to a free trade area.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the possibility of lessening of tension with Eastern European
                        countries, Ambassador Lemberger said it appeared the Administration wished
                        to take steps in this direction, but opposition was being encountered in
                        Congress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> agreed and
                        added this is related to the Eastern European support for North Viet-Nam.
                        For example, after Poland had boasted of its support there, the Congress
                        wanted to withdraw Poland's most-favored-nation treatment. Ambassador
                        Lemberger replied that the Romanian Ambassador had recently expressed his
                        disappointment over his country's failure to achieve <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment, although Romania is seeking to expand trade. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> said our difficulty is
                        that we sometimes cannot find much to buy from Eastern European countries.
                        We are also hampered by our difficulty in extending credit, but our policy
                        remains to favor trade and contacts there.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Sweden </p>
                    <p>Ambassador Lemberger referred to a recently published study which indicated
                        Sweden was the third most admired foreign nation in the United States and
                        said this appeared to be changing. Is it true to speak of tension between
                        the two countries? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>
                        replied this is too strong a statement. There has perhaps been some change
                        in public opinion because many Americans find it difficult to understand
                        Sweden welcoming U.S. deserters and the increase in demonstrations there
                        recently has been noted. Now Sweden is moving to recognize Hanoi; this is
                        not unexpected and might help in contacting Hanoi from the West. None of
                        these will bring an official reaction from us and, in general, the Swedish
                        image here is good.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> took the line that we did not
                        need to seek dramatic short-term accomplishments on <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> follow-up studies. His concept was
                        that the “European settlement,” “disarmament and arms control” categories
                        were really continuing responsibilities, where concrete plans and actions by
                        NATO members were heavily dependent on timing and nature of Soviet
                        indications they were interested in discussing these topics. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thinks it probable that Soviets will
                        not be able to go very far in practical negotiations on any European subject
                        while Vietnam war is on.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> put great emphasis on central
                        importance of Germany in NATO consultations. While US participants
                        emphasized importance of no derogation from 4-power responsibilities for
                        Berlin and Germany, Secretary made clear that he would not feel that
                        consultation on German problems in wider NATO circle when initiated by the
                        Germans necessarily constituted any real threat to 4-power responsibility in
                        themselves. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> is acutely aware of
                        sensitivities involved in special responsibilities of occupying powers and
                        will work with us closely on this.</p>

                        stressed the internal uncertainties of German politics and danger of getting

                        necessity to maintain NATO strength, and to relate this policy to need for

                        to get political consensus this year on “floor” under current levels of
                        defense effort by NATO partners, as base for discussion of balanced
                        East-West reductions to make stalemate less expensive. Context of this idea
                        might be a special meeting this year—possibly at June Ministerial
                        Meeting—before which there will in any case have been discussion of Belgian
                        and other unsatisfactory force plans at May <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> Ministerial, and hopefully Defense Ministers agreement on
                        1969–73 force goals which are slightly above present levels.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Balance of Payments </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> reiterated his readiness to
                        move ahead with <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultations on balance
                        of payments. He was told, both in State and Treasury, that US is studying
                        various kinds of possible payments schemes without any firm idea yet whether
                        and when we may be able to make any concrete proposals. Meanwhile, there is
                        no objection to concentrating consultation in the first instance on trying
                        to get consensus on principle of equity expressed in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s comments at the Ministerial Meeting.
                        In large measure, this would be educational process of acquainting <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> with problem and means of handling it by
                        members. Seems unlikely that USG will be a good deal clearer on what we want
                        on <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultations by the time <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meets (on present expectations) in
                        mid-March.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Mediterranean </p>
                    <p>On several occasions <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> spoke in
                        strong terms on the need for vigorous pursuit of the Mediterranean study,
                        and mentioned as one desirable outcome the idea of a Standing NATO Naval
                        Force in the Mediterranean, to include at least Italy, UK and US. He said he
                        would discuss with Italians prior to first <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting on this subject, try to insure that they make
                        adequate contribution. We agreed with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that first step is agreed assessment for June
                        Ministerial Meeting. We emphasized that, apart from any NATO action
                        recommendations that might be developed subsequently, assessment would be
                        valuable to us and presumably others in connection with our bilateral
                        policies and actions in the area. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> also pointed up his concerns about Malta's economic
                        problems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. British Contribution to NATO </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> said that he thought British
                        would not be inclined to make further cuts in the British Army on Rhine. He
                        mentioned possible usefulness of NATO framework in Mediterranean as basis
                        for maintenance of British naval units there now that there is no British
                        national role in Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>
                        said that he would be visiting London in early March, <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0702"/>and he would try to take advantage for NATO
                        of statements that British leaders made in announcing their withdrawal from
                        commitments East of Suez, by suggesting withdrawal would enable enhanced
                        contribution by Britain to NATO.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Political Predictions </p>
                    <p>On several occasions <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> predicted
                        that France would not renounce the Treaty in 1969. He also said that
                        Scandinavia, both Norway and Denmark, were now much more solid in NATO
                        policy than they had previously been. His chief worry about future focused
                        on Germany and Italy where uncertainties resulting from internal political
                        rivalries might well overflow into NATO. He also showed concern about
                        Turkey. He was confident however that 1969 would come and go with no
                        defections from the Treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Briefings on Non-NATO Issues</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was briefed on present state of
                        Greek-Turkish discussions and possibility of future meeting for discussion
                        of fundamental Cyprus arrangements. He was also briefed on present state of
                        Jarring Mission, and (by both the President and Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>) on Vietnam. We stressed,
                        as <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> fully recognized, great
                        sensitivity and need for secrecy re Cyprus. He noted that, once discussions
                        go beyond Greek-Turkish relations, NATO role is to watch; discreetly
                        encourage where appropriate; but keep strictly hands off. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Southeast Asia </p>
                    <p>Secretary suggested to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that we
                        should have some discussion with Europeans on the question, “What kind of
                        Southeast Asia do the Europeans want?” In midst of present US difficulties
                        he felt some spontaneous response from Europe would be appropriate and
                        welcome. Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> to
                        convey to NATO partners great danger of chain reaction toward isolationism
                        in US resulting from isolationist actions and attitudes in Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Nuclear Planning Group</p>
                    <p>a) Defense discussions focused on nuclear planning group. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> emphasized importance of handling
                        Turkish <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss> planning so as to avoid any
                        implication that Turks cooled off because of any actions on our part.
                        Consensus was that Turkish plan should not be on NPG agenda as subject, and
                        Turks did not need to attend Ministerial meeting.</p>
                    <p>b) On <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, previous <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> view was watered down to
                        recommendation that, in deciding against <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s for Europe on basis present technological possibilities, NPG
                        should avoid saying “never never.” We agreed that precise formulation of
                        negative conclusion on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s for <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0703"/>Europe was very important so as to avoid
                        casting any doubts on the US decision and should be drafted and negotiated
                        with members prior to April Ministerial NPG. In discussions with Defense
                        staff and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed that it was
                        “probably not wise” to seek European participation in US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> research and development effort. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> also did not press his earlier notion
                        of a non-nuclear anti-missile system.</p>
                    <p>c) In discussion of tactical nuclear work program, we gave <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> early warning of US intention to
                        float a paper prior to The Hague meeting for discussion among Ministers
                        there, laying out a somewhat more ambitious work program of tactical nuclear
                        studies.</p>
                    <p>d) <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> repeated his earlier
                        insistence that NPG should discuss how to consult on use of nuclear weapons
                        in emergencies, saying that Athens Guidelines need to be “elaborated.” For
                        the first time in my experience, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> described <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>'s role
                        in an emergency in a most realistic fashion, saying that we had considered
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>'s role as “one alternative way” of
                        consulting with a view to the nuclear “decision” which would have to be made
                        by the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        emphasized suggestion that first priority should be given to tactical
                        nuclear studies, from which some useful generalizations about crisis
                        consultation might later be derived.</p>
                    <p>e) <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> put to Secretary-Designate
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> the importance his
                        personally attending meetings of NATO Defense Ministers, especially NPG.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said his present calendar
                        would make it possible to attend April NPG and May <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> meetings. He expressed special personal interest in making
                        contribution to work of Nuclear Planning Group.</p>

                    <p>1. I met with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        yesterday at my request. This was the first opportunity I had had to talk
                        with him since his meeting with Gen <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> in Paris on Feb 15–16. Our conversation lasted an hour
                        and a half. The Chancellor was in a good mood, very friendly and expansive,
                        and carried the discussion well beyond the time allotted.</p>
                    <p>2. I started by telling the Chancellor that the President and other high US
                        officials would welcome whatever he could tell us in confidence about what
                        transpired during his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, and how he appraised the results. I assured him that
                        whatever he said would be held in the strictest confidence. The Chancellor's
                        comments on the meeting are reported in this telegram and in the three
                        following telegrams on Eastern policy (II), the future shape of Europe (III)
                        and financial questions (IV). The Chancellor's remarks on Vietnam are
                        reported in telegram V of this series.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor said that, as was usual in such meetings, there had been a
                        dispute between himself and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        over their respective views toward the US. This time he believed we had “won
                        some ground”. Whereas de Gaulle had stressed the great power of the US—which
                        he said constituted a threat to other countries—the Chancellor had referred
                        to the power of the Soviet Union as being a much more dangerous threat.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had told him that he
                        could not understand the German attitude toward NATO. However, he accepted
                        the fact that Germany wished to “practice” NATO. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had also said that he fully understands the German
                        desire for the continued presence of American forces in Europe. He also
                        appreciates the value of the Alliance. NATO can only be abandoned if the
                        threat to Europe is removed—which he does not now consider to be the case.
                        Unless something else “quite unforeseeable” arose, France would not leave
                        it. The Chancellor repeated to me the words “quite unforeseeable”, which he
                        thought was a stronger expression than <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> has previously used. He considered this to be
                        particularly significant, since <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had used this expression both in his private meeting
                        with him and in the large plenary session.</p>
                    <p>4. The Chancellor said that he emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, as we had always done in the past, that there cannot
                        be full German-French cooperation as long as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> continues to make public anti-American statements. He
                        told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that he (<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>) had lost much support in Germany
                        as a result of these statements. The Chancellor also told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that, as far as the facts are
                        concerned, he did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and the US were so far apart on their concepts of the
                        future of Europe. Both Germany and France want a strong and united Europe,
                        which can constitute a stabilizing factor in the world. He assured <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that this is also what the US
                        wants. If Europe can be united in agreement with the US, Europe “can do its
                        share” in coping with free world problems.</p>
                    <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0705"/>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had, in a sense,
                        apologized for the categorical language he customarily uses. He said that
                        this has been necessitated by the French internal political situation. He
                        needs the support of the Communists, and can get this if he makes statements
                        such as his charge that the UK is “a satellite of the US”. The Chancellor
                        believes this is an important element in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s thinking. He had last summer given <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> a similar explanation of his
                        position.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to UK entry into the Common Market, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> advised me that “we stick with
                        our position”. There should be a “beginning of negotiations with the UK on
                        entry”. Of course, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has
                        opposed this. However, <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                        pushed him in Paris to permit a start to be made. In the end <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had been willing to state, both
                        privately to him and in the communique text, that both countries welcome in
                        principle the entry of other countries—mentioning specifically the UK.</p>
                    <p>7. The question remained, said the Chancellor: “Can one really do something?”
                        The idea of a “sort of free trade area” as a possible solution had,
                        according to the Chancellor, been a common idea. When I queried him closely,
                        he would not admit that either France or Germany had proposed the idea
                        first. One motivation of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in
                        agreeing to the idea, which he expressly confirmed to the Chancellor, was to
                        “help the UK fulfill the conditions for entry into the Common Market more
                        quickly”.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> commented that he had
                        recently been advised by an Amb of Scandinavian country (not specified),
                        that they would welcome the free trade area approach. The Amb had said that
                        this was the view of his government, which also thought that the UK had not
                        handled well its efforts to attain entry into the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>9. “The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s of the Six will now meet
                        on the 29th,” the Chancellor continued, “and we will see what comes out”. Of
                        those who will most likely oppose the French-German proposals, he mentioned
                        Dutch <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>, who is the “most stubborn” UK
                        advocate. In response to my query, the Chancellor said that he had not been
                        fully advised as to the results of <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>' talk with <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>
                        the previous day. He himself had not been able to see <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>.</p>
                    <p>10. At this point I emphasized to the Chancellor how important it was to us
                        that any provisional arrangements with the UK and others be clearly
                        preparatory to their early admission as full members of the Common Market.
                        As he knew, we and others had opposed free trade areas, in themselves, as
                        being merely preferential trading arrangements. The Chancellor said that he
                        fully understood this.</p>
                    <p>11. In summarizing the results of his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> insofar as it applied to UK
                        entry, the Chancellor said that “This was the maximum we could get. If we
                        had gotten nothing, there would have been a crisis within the Common Market,
                        which Germany wishes to prevent. As things now stand the French have agreed
                        to go ahead.” He believed <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0706"/>that the
                        UK should now be willing “to put its foot in the door.” In response to my
                        query, he said that he did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s agreement to proceed constituted merely a maneuver
                        on his part. Close cooperation with Germany in Europe would not be possible
                        if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would now renege on the
                        assurances he had given in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor confirmed that it was the German and French intention that
                        both industry and agriculture be included in any arrangement with the UK.
                        “In my view,” he said, “we must keep moving. The UK must not be isolated.”
                        Although he agreed that the Six should continue to talk among themselves and
                        have other contacts with the UK, it was not his impression, as it had been
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s as conveyed to me in my
                        meeting with him on Feb 20 (see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                            8569),<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">Dated February 20. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> 6 UK)</note> that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has agreed to outside
                        consultation with the UK on exchange of technology. This <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> considers to be a Community
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>12. In response to my query, the Chancellor said that he did not think very
                        much of the Benelux plan—somewhat contrary to what <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had advised me was his view (Bonn
                        8569). It was largely on considerations of prestige that the decision had
                        been made to discuss this plan in Brussels on February 29. The Germans
                        themselves opposed “any front against the French.” Such action would not be
                        constructive. French resistance would only be accentuated, and a crisis
                        would result in the Community.</p>
                    <p>13. The Chancellor observed that Germany has, through the stand it has taken,
                        been put in an uncomfortable situation. Luns, as well as certain British
                        newspapers, have said that the “Germans have bowed to France.” The
                        Chancellor noted that he had, in his speech in Hamburg on February 21, said
                        that it was much better “to show patience in these matters,” as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had attempted to do, rather than to act
                        “out of spite” and “as little children.”</p>
                    <p>14. In speaking of his personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, the Chancellor said that he believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had confidence in him—because the
                        Chancellor had always been frank with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and because <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> was convinced of the Chancellor's commitment to
                        German-French cooperation. It was quite possible, the Chancellor speculated,
                        that France could take a contrary position, i.e., one antagonistic to
                        Germany. The Chancellor commented that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had told him that he must be the “harmonizer.” He
                        was ready to do this, both on behalf of French-US relations and
                        French-European relations—even though this was not rewarding.</p>

                    <p>1. At <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting March 13 large majority
                        supported <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s procedural
                        proposals in PO/68/102<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">Not found.</note> for
                        improving NATO/Malta relationship, i.e., through NATO's establishment of
                        open-ended Malta Committee and through Malta's official and public
                        designation of Ambassador Curmi to maintain liaison with NATO. Only France
                        and Denmark balked at these proposals. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> asked <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s of
                        these countries to report majority consensus to their governments and
                        expressed hope that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> could reach positive
                        decision at March 20 meeting.</p>
                    <p>2. Re associating <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> with strategy study on
                        Malta, there was general consensus that Maltese views should be solicited on
                        study after <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> has had preliminary
                        discussion on it but before study has been formally approved by Council.
                        Comment: Present status is that <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>
                        study has, unfortunately, been revised by international military staff at
                        British insistence to delete all economic and political comments, as well as
                        list of possible courses of action. This revised draft is scheduled for
                        Military Committee consideration March 14. End comment.</p>
                    <p>3. Re <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s suggestion that some
                        form of collective economic aid for Malta might be considered, there was
                        significant support in principle even though several delegates expressed
                        anticipated doubts about NATO being appropriate forum for this subject. De
                        Ferrariis (Italy) said that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is agreeable
                        in principle to joint study of this idea. He suggested that, in view of
                        Malta's size, a minor effort could produce excellent economic and
                        psychological results. <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>
                        (Germany) recognized the danger that Malta might turn elsewhere for economic
                        aid. He said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has already shown an
                        interest in economic projects there and would be prepared to consult on this
                        point within NATO.</p>
                    <p>4. In explaining French opposition to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s proposals, <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> (France) feared that, if NATO takes proposed
                        procedural steps, it would <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0708"/>risk
                        giving impression that NATO is supporting the present Maltese government and
                        that NATO plans doing more than it actually has in mind. He added that,
                        personally, he is not convinced that Malta is an important part of the
                        developing military situation in the Mediterranean and doubts the utility of
                        taking steps which would give the impression that NATO considers Malta to be
                        more important than it is in fact.</p>
                    <p>5. Hjorth-Nielsen (Denmark) said initial Danish reaction was doubt regarding
                        the advisability of creating “new machinery” for NATO/Malta relations, but
                        he promised to report faithfully the majority consensus in favor of these
                        steps.</p>
                    <p>6. Groundwork for satisfactory outcome March 13 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting was laid in March 12 Malta group (US, UK, Italy)
                        meeting convened by <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> at which
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> outlined US ideas
                            <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. In light of French and Danish
                        positions, <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> considered it was
                        best during this <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion to limit
                        himself to statement in support of <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s procedural proposals.</p>
                    <p>7. Re Department's concern reftel about legal implications of designating
                        Ambassador Curmi as “authorized link,” <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> accepted suggestion by Boon (Netherlands) that it
                        would be preferable to use term “liaison” rather than “link.” We agree that
                        liaison is a better term, and see no problem if <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> chooses to name Ambassador Curmi as its “liaison” with NATO
                        for consultation as foreseen in the 1965 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        resolution.</p>

                        what might emerge from discussions in Brussels. Until Communities had made
                        further progress in sorting out their own position, it was not appropriate
                        for US to become involved. US noted, however, that there were no membership
                        provisions in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposals and this seemed
                        significant flaw. We favored full UK membership and could understand
                        transitional arrangement directed clearly to this end.</p>

                    <p>In November Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, then State
                        Secretary for Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany, handed Deputy
                        Secretary of Defense Nitze a memorandum which proposed a) increased <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> participation in the formulation and review
                        of NATO nuclear plans, b) notice of requests submitted by General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> to the President for selective
                        release of nuclear weapons to be employed from or on German soil in order to
                        give the German Government an opportunity to express its views, and c) an
                        arrangement whereby orders for selective use of nuclear weapons by German
                        units would be subject to confirmation by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Government. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text

                    <p>A US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> staff level task force has been
                        exploring without commitment the details and implications of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> request. At a meeting next week the US team
                        expects to discuss with the Germans a draft task force report to the
                        respective Defense Ministers which would suggest that a confidential letter
                        between the President and the Chancellor would be an appropriate vehicle for
                        any undertaking between the two governments</p>
                    <p>1) to consult prior to selective release by the US of nuclear weapons for use
                        in or from any part of Germany, and</p>
                    <p>2) that the US would not selectively release nuclear weapons for use by
                        German delivery forces over the objection of the Government of the Federal
                        Republic.</p>
                    <p>While the draft report does not actually recommend these consultation and
                        release commitments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> and I consider it desirable that you be informed of
                        this trend of thinking before our staffs mention it to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, since it may logically lead to a proposal
                        to you for consideration of such a letter and undertaking.</p>
                    <p>We would favor in principle this general approach for the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (8 lines of source text) not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2) As for a German desire for some measure of control over use of their
                        delivery forces, it is difficult to deny a request for this degree of
                        recognition of sovereignty and civilian control, or to envisage
                        circumstances under which the President would want to release nuclear
                        weapons for use by German units over the objection of the German Government.
                        An arrangement recognizing this seems preferable to establishment by the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> of de facto controls and
                        communications by which it could assure that German units do not employ
                        nuclear weapons without a confirmatory order from the German Government.</p>
                    <p>3) Failure to achieve satisfactory nuclear consultation arrangements could
                        cause considerable difficulty for the <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> Government.</p>
                    <p>4) A refusal to grant this relatively modest request for sovereign rights in
                        the nuclear field could complicate other nuclear issues including the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of amenities Professor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed his great pleasure at being back in the
                        U.S. and at the opportunity to renew his friendship with the President and
                        the Secretary. He said he was profoundly aware of the problems this country
                        faced but that they were related to European problems. In this connection he
                        referred to the recent meeting of the presidents of Central Banks here and
                        thought their conclusions were the right ones.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary admitted to our having some serious problems, but pointed out
                        they affect the entire free world. He said it was not a question whether
                        Europeans supported the U.S. or the U.S. supported Europe. It was more
                        important for Europeans to ask themselves what kind of Asia did they want to
                        live with. What kind of Southeast Asia was desired by Europe? Did Europeans
                        look without apprehension at a militant brand of communism in Asia which had
                        sent 40,000 guerrillas to Laos, penetrated Thailand, entered Cambodia and
                        sent agents to Burma?</p>
                    <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said there was a
                        malaise in Europe over the Viet-Nam question. He thought <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had played a role in infecting
                        all of Europe. He didn't feel there was so much anti-U.S. feeling as there
                        was a desire, particularly on the part of Germany, not to irritate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on the one hand and not to lose
                        the friendship of the U.S. on the other. He said there had been some recent
                        remarks made which he regarded most unfortunate and then referred in this
                        connection to “Atlantic imperium”, and the book by <persName>Jean
                            Jacques</persName> Servan-Schreiber “Le defi Americain”. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> referred to the uneasiness created by
                        the student unrest and the development of the extreme left and right in
                        Germany. He foresaw no great danger from these quarters in the final
                        analysis, but their action caused much uneasiness in Germany. He said there
                        was doubt in Europe <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0712"/>regarding NATO.
                        There were stupid people who shouted that the U.S. should end the war in
                        Viet-Nam but had no alternative solution to what was being done now. He said
                        again that the feeling wasn't anti-American but there was much anti-war
                        feeling in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he
                        feared a U.S. retreat into isolationism. He concluded by saying that he was
                        happy to see the President remain unyielding and devoted to the course he
                        had set for this country.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was a serious problem with growing isolationism on
                        both sides of the Atlantic. In this country the same critics who want us to
                        withdraw from Viet-Nam are clamoring for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from
                        Europe. Such withdrawals would surely result in isolationism in this
                        country. The Secretary saw similar signs in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he was determined
                        to speak more often to his own people on these issues. While he did not deny
                        the influence <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has had on
                        European thinking, he thought too much importance was attached here to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He felt the other five
                        in the Common Market and the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> nations
                        as well desired continued Atlantic cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, to be sure, desires European isolation. Erhard
                        said that Europeans were frequently schizophrenic. They asked the U.S. to
                        take certain actions—he was referring to the stability of the dollar—and
                        when the U.S. does then the Europeans scream that their commerce would be
                        destroyed. He said it was difficult for the Europeans to make up their minds
                        one way or the other. In this connection Erhard said he had strongly
                        supported the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> carrying out the tariff
                        cuts agreed upon in order to make it more difficult for protectionism to
                        grow in this country.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> about German
                        political developments. He wondered if the Coalition would last.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said the Secretary must be
                        aware of his opposition to the Grand Coalition. He thought a government was
                        credible only when there was real opposition as the experience in Anglo
                        Saxon countries has shown. He said there was no real discussion in the
                        German parliament today and suggested if anyone had any difficulty sleeping
                        without sedatives he should go and sit in the German parliament. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> continued by saying the German people
                        did not feel the goals had been achieved which the Grand Coalition had set
                        for itself. He found it difficult to see what would happen in 1969 if there
                        was no electoral reform legislation and he doubted that there would be any.
                        He felt there was considerable opposition in the Grand Coalition in both of
                        the great parties in Germany. As far as he was concerned he would shed no
                        tears over the end of the Grand Coalition but assured the Secretary he had
                        no personal ambitions. He did venture the prophecy that it was possible that
                        disappointment with the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> could lead to an
                        absolute majority for the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> in 1969.</p>
                    <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0713"/>
                    <p>To a question by the Secretary regarding the NPD, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> minimized its strength. He thought it would be
                        difficult for this right wing party to surmount the required five per cent
                        in 1969.</p>
                    <p>In adjourning for lunch at the White House the Secretary expressed his great
                        appreciation to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> for his
                        contributions to European unity. In parting, the Secretary said his greatest
                        regret was that at a time when the communist camp found itself in its
                        greatest disarray, we in the free world are in great disarray ourselves.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President: </p>
                    <p>Attached is the summary report of consultations on the Hill which our
                        Ambassador to NATO, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan Cleveland</persName>,
                        undertook at your request. He spoke to 17 Senators and 17 Representatives.
                        (The list is at Tab A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">Neither attachment is
                            printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>His major conclusions are: </p>
                    <p>1. There is continued support in Congress for NATO.</p>
                    <p>2. The Mansfield Resolution is quiescent—but NATO troop levels will become a
                        major issue if reserves are called up.</p>
                    <p>3. If reserves are called up, we should argue we must not be pulled out of
                        Europe by events in Asia.</p>
                    <p>4. Congressional frustration over Vietnam is widespread. The fact the
                        Europeans are not “helping us” in Vietnam is often mentioned. Opponents of
                        our Vietnam policy are waiting to seize on some issue with Vietnam
                        implications, filibuster it to death, and bring about a “damaging and
                        divisive state of affairs”.</p>
                    <p>5. The Administration should emphasize that holding the line in Europe and
                        bringing the Vietnam conflict to a successful conclusion are both necessary
                        parts of a global strategy to keep the peace.</p>

                            summary of the North Atlantic Council meeting of March 27, which
                            included a preliminary discussion of bilateral East-West talks on
                            European security. (Ibid., NATO 8–2) </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Following are highlight impressions from lengthy March 27 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion, sparked by <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, of relationship between bilateral
                        East-West contacts and <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultations on
                        detente-related subject. General level of animation no doubt due to fact
                        that <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>, in his talks with
                        Hungarians and Yugoslavs, touched on issue of finding way for East Germans
                        to make views known on future security arrangements in Europe.</p>
                    <p>2. Belgians and Dutch, seconded by Scandinavians, are quite defensive about
                        role of smaller allies in taking soundings with East and are tempted to
                        equate impasse on fundamental European issues with giganticism of major
                        powers. Dutch <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>, reading from
                        instructions spoke somewhat emotionally to point there no “monopoly” on
                        detente initiatives.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> apparently determined to prevent if
                        possible even exploratory discussion in Group of Ten or elsewhere of East
                        German representation. <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> in final intervention put
                        “precise point” that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was posing to
                        allies its “desire” that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> question
                        “should not be touched at this time, at least, without consulting us” adding
                        that allies traditionally respected such wishes of members if vital national
                        interests concerned.</p>
                    <p>4. At same time, <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName> was at pains
                        to leave door open when he stressed that position on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could not be fixed in advance because <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> views not necessarily same next year or two
                        years from now as they are today. He said that “everything depends on
                        conditions and prospects.”</p>
                    <p>5. Italians continue surprisingly strong and solid support of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, perhaps because their traditional allergy
                        to being left out is reinforced in this case by fact that their opposition
                        identifies them with larger rather than smaller allies.</p>
                    <p>6. French are participating in debate, picking up marbles in Bonn by standing
                        firmly on special responsibility of quadripartite powers, no doubt conscious
                        that this is their most visible political credential of major <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0715"/>power status. This has interesting effect
                        of winning French endorsement of relevance of multilateral as well as
                        bilateral approaches to major East-West issues.</p>
                    <p>7. British, who announced in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> upcoming
                        Eastern European tour by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>, are avoiding main issues and not asserting four
                        power prerogatives, though UK Del tells us here they working on Dutch
                        bilaterally re Luns initiative.</p>
                    <p>8. Debate in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and senior political
                        committee is serving several purposes which in our view are healthy:</p>
                    <p>A. Smoking out intentions and aspirations of allies in detente politics which
                        clearly remains in vogue with majority of allies.</p>
                    <p>B. Creating climate in which allies are unlikely to make more than tentative
                        new probes without returning to Council for consultations.</p>
                    <p>C. Revealing built-in governors which should bring about more realistic
                        expectations on part of more optimistic allies.</p>
                    <p>9. So far as procedural status, Brosio summarized situation as follows, which
                        seems accurate rendition to us:</p>
                    <p>A. Difficult to draw line where exploratory discussions begin to shade into
                        negotiation but only practical approach is to leave that judgment to Western
                        principal undertaking probe.</p>
                    <p>B. On subjects identified in <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        Report as future tasks of Alliance, <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        consultations have taken “a step forward from general to specific”
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>C. Best way to avoid possible damage from bilateral initiatives is to
                        continue consultations already begun in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        and senior Political Committee.</p>

                        A regarding risk of European separatism as opposed to Atlantic cooperation.
                        Rather, our general posture must be to examine sympathetically and on merits

                        Europe and North America within the Alliance. This attitude is consist-ent

                    <p>2. We are satisfied with the current organization at <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and believe alteration lessening US
                        influence dependent on it being clearly evident that change responded to a

                    <p>3. Re specific ideas mentioned in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s,
                        we have no objection in principle to examine ways and means to strengthen
                        Deputy <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>'s role. However, a
                        non-American as <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> Chief of Staff would
                        present various practical problems at this time, due to certain sensitive

                        largely conceptual, in developing models of and proposals for consideration
                        in course of NATO <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> Study. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In political climate of increasing detente
                        when pressure in Europe is to reduce military forces, it seems unreal to
                        focus much attention on establishing force ceilings. Fact that Belgians hope
                        to realize domestic political objectives and have gone out on limb with
                        Poles regarding topic does not alter this. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Prospects of converting “ceiling” to credible “floor” for NATO forces should
                        also be related to development of models for consideration during study.
                        Obviously, NATO can best induce reciprocity from East in direct proportion
                        to extent it can convince East that it will not engage in unilateral
                        reductions, and this proposition relates to consideration freeze as well as
                        whole philosophy behind <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We therefore believe that Belgian proposal should not, standing alone, be
                        considered as very promising proposal to limit forces when there is little
                        real prospect of overall quantitative increase. Similarly, proposal should
                        not be exploited for sole purpose of attempting establish floor for NATO
                        forces as condition precedent to examination possibilities <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>. Main purpose of study is to evaluate
                        political, military and economic implications of, and possibilities for,
                        mutual reductions. Attention should not be diverted to consideration
                        “floors” or “ceilings” to extent of preempting this main purpose.</p>
                    <p>3. Freeze as a Ceiling: We believe in any mutual force reductions proposal to
                        East that may emerge from study, including features or concepts of Belgian
                        proposal, ceiling on force levels should be quantitative <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0718"/>(i.e., limited to number of men in active
                        forces) rather than qualitative (i.e., relating to deployments, delivery
                        vehicles, or nuclear or conventional weapons). We see no practical present
                        possibility of qualitative stage such as Belgians appear to envisage as
                        possible second step. Freeze ceiling should, in our view, include troops
                        redeployed by US and UK and still committed to NATO.</p>
                    <p>Any agreed ceiling should also in our view be over-all figure for NATO rather
                        than separate national figures in order that better burden-sharing may be
                        arranged, e.g., by increasing one country's force contribution to compensate
                        for another's decrease. Similarly, ceiling should apply to whole NATO area
                        and should not inhibit movements within that area, e.g., central front to
                        flanks, as situations of tension may require. Nor should ceilings be stated
                        in such terms as to inhibit reserve programs and mobilization capabilities
                        either alone or in conjunction with reduction of active forces. We would
                        wish to see any language proposed.</p>
                    <p>Ceiling could at least in theory be based on any of three levels: (1) Force
                        goal proposal level at any given time, (2) Force plan level for 1968–72 or
                        1969–73 or, (3) De facto level at time of offer or at time of acceptance of
                        reciprocity by East.</p>
                    <p>However attractive from force planning standpoint, do not consider offer of
                        ceiling based on goals in excess of actual levels at time of its acceptance
                        would be credible and provide NATO favorable image as seeking detente.
                        Moreover, such an offer would prejudice chance of getting countries
                        primarily interested in disarmament to accept a reasonable floor or base
                        line from which to project possible reductions. On other hand, any freeze or
                        reduction offer should not be so framed as to place limits on current
                        efforts improve force posture prior to effective date of East-West agreement
                        or mutual example arrangement. Thus priority task in NATO would continue to
                        be to build adequate forces in being in time to be reflected in 1969–73
                        force plan to be acted on by Ministers in December 1969. Possibility
                        continued NATO improvement in force level could in this way be reconciled
                        with disarmament aspect of offer.</p>
                    <p>4. Freeze as Floor or Base Line: Unlike ceiling aspect of freeze, extent to
                        which it would involve any agreed floor for NATO forces in event Warsaw Pact
                        countries not responsive to <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> proposals is
                        internal NATO matter which should not be subject negotiation or agreement by
                        East.</p>
                    <p> US attitude regarding base line should be consistent with statement by
                        President following call by NATO Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, February 19, namely “They considered
                        the maintenance of NATO's strength, including the US commitment, as
                        necessary to continuing stability and security in the North Atlantic area.
                        This stability and security provides the basis for exploring with the USSR
                        the possibility of mutual force reductions.”</p>
                    <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0719"/>
                    <p>While idea of clearly defined and firmly agreed NATO floor under forces would
                        contribute substantially to strength and stability, we believe prospects for
                        obtaining agreement this sort not better than in past in light of such
                        factors as <gloss target="#t_BALPA1">BALPA</gloss>, competing needs for US
                        troops in various parts of the world, Congressional and public sentiments on
                        burden-sharing and existing US force levels in Europe, and pressures for
                        budget cuts in several NATO governments. Although such floor may not be
                        possible, one year commitment aspect of annual NATO force plans might,
                        during period of any <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> offers to the other
                        side, be reinforced at a minimum by official recognition by NATO bodies that
                        strong and stable NATO is political imperative for successful negotiation.
                        Corollary might be understood to be that no arbitrary or destabilizing
                        changes in general commitments of forces would be appropriate.</p>
                    <p>5. Verification of Freeze: In view well known political difficulties of any
                        attempt gain what Soviets call inspection without disarmament, believe one
                        of questions which should be addressed in forthcoming <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> Study should be possibility of use
                        unilateral means for verification for any freeze proposal as entity in
                        itself or as first step in reduction proposal. Risks and possibilities
                        should be objectively assessed in course study with US Del not endorsing
                        Belgian idea verification unless conclusion of <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> Study clearly warrants.</p>
                    <p>6. Prospects: Despite apparently growing pressures for accelerated
                        conclusions, we remain of view that Ministerial Meeting in December earliest
                        practicable time for reaching conclusions on freeze and <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>. Even then, we cannot prejudge results of
                        study to say whether finding would be that any specific proposal should be
                        made at that time. It may well be possible at Reykjavik, however, to allude
                        in some public way to Belgian proposal for freeze as one of models to be
                        considered if this will be of assistance to <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>.</p>

                    <p>1. Meeting of NATO Nuclear Planning Group April 18 accomplished main US
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s presence,
                        obvious interest, active substantive participation, and bilateral
                        conversations, all emphasized that US retains liveliest intention to share
                        responsibility for nuclear planning with interested NATO allies.</p>
                    <p>3. Full consensus reached that “in light of current and foreseeable
                        technological circumstances, the deployment of ABMS in NATO Europe is not at
                        present warranted”: but question kept under review in case “underlying
                        factors” should change.</p>
                    <p>4. Greek <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss> proposals were sidetracked in
                        favor of a study of “time factors relevant to the employment of <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s”. This is agreed to be key area that needs
                        to be sorted out before detailed military plans could be drafted for use of
                            <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s in Greece or anywhere else. Germans
                        continue to be skeptical of <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Greeks would still like <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s but tacitly accepted stalling tactic.</p>
                    <p>5. The development of political “guidelines” for tactical use of nuclear
                        weapons was the main focus at the one-day meeting. It is now clear all
                        around that NPG will not try to write a one-time full-bloom “concept” for
                        tactical nuclear weapons as a class: rather, Ministers will gradually
                        develop what Healey called a “corpus of doctrine” by induction from the
                        ongoing studies of specific systems and scenarios. For this purpose, NPG
                        Ministers agreed to concentrate for the time being on the kinds of uses most
                        likely to be considered as politically feasible by NATO governments: (A)
                        demonstrative use, (B) clearly defensive systems (<gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s and air defense), (C) use at sea, and (D) selective use
                        against battlefield targets in a limited conflict. These fields divided thus
                        among the four permanent members for discussion leadership—(A) US, (B)
                        Italy, (C) UK, (D) <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. The long-smoldering complaints about national govt participation in
                        military nuclear planning are now effectively answered by NPG Ministerial
                        endorsement of the Military Committee paper on the subject.</p>
                    <p>7. That other ancient issue, how host countries get enough influence on the
                        use of nuclear weapons from or on their own territory, was nearly (but not
                        quite) laid to rest by US endorsement of the second German paper on the
                        subject. Ministers agreed to a general principle, sought by the Germans,
                        that in nuclear consultation “special weight should be given to the views of
                        the NATO countries most directly affected.”</p>
                    <p>8. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> used occasion to state and
                        advertise US view that <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would not
                        interfere with NPG. This was well received by continental Europeans. British
                        agreed with this sentiment, and endorsed it in confidential minute, but
                        resisted saying so out loud.</p>

                    <p>151414. Subject: European Unification and the Neutrals.</p>
                    <p>1. Swiss Trade Negotiator Weitnauer called on <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>, April 22, and posed series of questions centering on
                        neutral relations with <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. Essentials of
                        exchange follow.</p>
                    <p>2. What would be U.S. position if faced with purely commercial arrangement
                        not clearly leading to membership between <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                        and UK?</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> judged this unlikely
                        eventuality since UK probably not settle for less than full membership in
                        view of its determination gain political role in Europe. This especially
                        important to UK as East of Suez position being drastically reduced. US does
                        favor full UK membership and not a preferential commercial agreement.</p>
                    <p>4. Decade ago US had two motives for favoring European unity—political and
                        economic. Today, economic goal less important because of European economic
                        restoration. Political goal remains and is even more important. We see no
                        chance Europe play decisive and constructive world role unless united. And
                        given present US balance payments situation, only major political component
                        could counterbalance US opposition to expanded area of European commercial
                        discrimination.</p>
                    <p>5. In this political Europe, is there a place for a truly neutral country
                        like Switzerland or Sweden?</p>

                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> replied that he did not
                        believe Switzerland or Sweden needed to be members or associates of the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> for economic reasons. Each could solve
                        its problems on an <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> basis. If a neutral
                        became a member of the Communities, progress to political unity would be
                        halted. We cannot see how the existing European political situation could be
                        improved by a commercial arrangement involving the UK or the neutrals. It
                        seems to us best to wait with some patience to allow the longer term forces
                        pushing Europe toward unity to have their effect.</p>
                    <p>7. Weitnauer, during course of his inquiries, made clear his belief that UK
                        should accept <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> commercial arrangement and
                        strongly hinted Switzerland and perhaps other small <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> states would urge this on UK at May 8/9 <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> Council. He said that desired UK
                        membership could be advanced simply by involving <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and UK in commercial negotiations.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Sharp mentioned that the June NATO Ministerial Meeting at Reykjavik will
                        coincide with the Canadian elections, and he feared that he would be unable
                        to attend since his absence from the country at the time would be regarded
                        in Canada, he thought, as “supreme arrogance.”</p>
                    <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0723"/>
                    <p>The Secretary turned the discussion to the possibilities of mutual force
                        reductions in Europe. If both sides could come to see the desirability of
                        reduction of military forces in Central Europe, a premise would exist for
                        progress along these lines. If there is a chance of this kind, then it would
                        help us in holding the line against pressures here to withdraw US forces
                        from Europe. If there could be real signs of hope at the Reykjavik meeting,
                        then the new President might not find himself confronted with over-whelming
                        pressure on the issue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to comment that with 650,000 men deployed in Vietnam,
                        with the 7th Fleet, and in near-by areas, it was a near miracle that we had
                        been able to resist pressures for substantial withdrawal from Europe. He
                        therefore hoped that as the Canadian Government reviewed its own situation
                        it would bear in mind that Canadian actions might well have a “multiplier
                        effect” in the US. Even a move toward reduction by Luxembourg complicated
                        our problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary volunteered that he was not too hopeful that the Soviet Union
                        could go very far toward mutual force reduction under present circumstances.
                        He thought the Russians were very much concerned about what could happen in
                        Eastern Europe. The Soviets also would have a political problem in taking
                        steps which would appear to release US forces for action in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharp inquired as to how deep the Russian concern is about Eastern
                        Europe, and the Secretary responded that he thought their concern was very
                        real, for example, with respect to Czechoslovakia. He suspected they were
                        also under some pressure from Ulbricht.</p>

                        <item>Under Secretary Rostow </item>
                        <item>Robert T. Grey, Jr., Member of German Bundestag</item>

                    <p>Mr. Birrenbach said that his impression on coming here this time was that the
                        United States was beset with a major land war in Asia, an internal racial
                        crisis of mounting proportions, and a financial crisis. All this would lead
                        to an agonizing reappraisal of United States foreign policy, and he expected
                        the United States to conclude that it must limit its commitments in the
                        world. If so, he hoped that the United States would give Europe first
                        consideration in its scale of priorities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow acknowledged the essential correctness of Birrenbach's appraisal,
                        but said he was confident of the outcome, given the texture of our society.
                        He ascribed the current mood to a popular unwillingness to abandon 19th
                        Century attitudes, even though these could not be reconciled with the
                        problems of security with which the United States had been confronted after
                        1945. He expressed confidence that, regardless of who was elected this year,
                        the new administration would reaffirm the world position of the United
                        States, despite the problems it faced. He stressed, however, that other
                        nations must join us in fulfilling this task. Birrenbach said Germans
                        understood this, but that to join the United States means to exercise
                        independent leadership as well, and that this latter concept was what
                            <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> had in mind in opposing
                        “an Atlantic imperium”. Mr. Rostow also pointed out that it was of
                        fundamental importance that there be no reduction in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> troop levels. Birrenbach said that <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, with detente foremost in its mind, saw this issue
                        differently.</p>
                    <p> Birrenbach said Europeans should show understanding for the enormous
                        problems which the United States was struggling. For example, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should avoid steps which clearly seemed to
                        identify Germany with French policy. He said <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> had asked him to tell the United States that there
                        was no such identification. He mentioned the Chancellor's efforts to
                        persuade <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to accept a
                        preferential arrangement between the UK and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the subsequent repudiation by other French officials of
                        what <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> thought had been
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s acquiescence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow assured him that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had no
                        reason to be worried that the United States might misunderstand German
                        moves. There was no anxiety here about the Franco-German relationship. In
                        fact, we regarded this relationship as the foundation for the Europe of the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked why some Germans still doubted whether the United States
                        endorsed German Eastern policy. He said the United States had no
                        reservations over the German initiatives. Birrenbach attributed the
                        beginning of such reports to former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. He said he personally had never heard Americans
                        express such feelings. At the same time, the United States should be
                        cautious on Berlin. He thought the German Government was giving too high
                        priority to its Eastern <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0725"/>policy. He
                        feared it would raise unrealistic popular expectations for an early
                        resolution of the German question.</p>
                    <p>On Berlin, Mr. Rostow emphasized that the United States view on holding
                        Bundestag Committee meetings in the city was that one should keep on holding
                        those activities in Berlin that had been held there in the past.</p>

                    <p> Lahr said that European cooperation and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> are not in good shape at the moment. The Germans had
                        expected the British drive for immediate entry to cause serious problems,
                        and as it has turned out, it had an even deeper and more divisive impact
                        than had been expected. The Germans are trying hard to find expedients to
                        bridge over the current difficult period while preparing the way for future
                        British entry. The British themselves had caused some problems to the
                        Germans in these efforts, especially <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George
                            Brown</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> is more
                        flexible, and, of course, there are great difficulties with Paris—it is
                        becoming clear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        dislikes anything resembling a rapprochement between the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Lahr what posture he thought we should adopt. We have
                        felt that we should remain quiet and reserved, so as not to provoke
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> into an even more rigid
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p> Lahr thought that the United States posture was about right. He thought we
                        should avoid a show of activism, and that we should understand and
                        sympathize with efforts to reach intermediate solutions. He thought we could
                        show sympathy for the overall objective—an integrated Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that one tragedy is the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has failed to achieve his own
                        goal, leadership of a Europe strong enough to enter into an equal
                        trans-Atlantic partnership. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        has exercised his veto so often that no one asks any longer, “What does
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> think?” </p>
                    <p> Lahr said the Germans would gladly let <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> step up front since the Germans have no national
                        ambitions for European leadership. But his policies are mutually
                        contradictory—he proclaims his desire for an independent Europe as an equal
                        partner to the super-powers, but he <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0727"/>has barred the development of such a Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has his own European theory—a small continental
                        Europe led by France; but the other continental countries simply wouldn't
                        accept it. He is isolated but doesn't realize this. The Germans don't think
                        that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> can remain blind to
                        the facts forever, and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> is trying to open his eyes to the truth.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it is tragic that France is absent from so much important
                        international activity that is going on, and to which the French would have
                        much to contribute: NATO, Geneva <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> talks,
                        the United Nations where the French do not play a serious role,
                        international monetary negotiations where they are a minority of one. We
                        would like to see them take a useful part and see their talents
                        utilized.</p>
                    <p> Lahr wondered whether the fact that Paris had been chosen as the site for
                        the Viet-Nam talks would have useful effects on United States-French
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that it might work the other way. We prefer Paris over
                        Warsaw because all our allies have missions there. If <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> interferes in the talks in a way
                        detrimental to our position it would damage our bilateral relations. But
                        that remains to be seen.</p>
                    <p> Lahr thought that the French would not interfere gratuitously, but would
                        wait to be asked. It is true, of course, that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> will be waiting eagerly to be asked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does
                        have a sense of propriety. Later, when we really get into the talks we'll
                        see what the French do. The French press is hostile to us.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Minister: </p>
                    <p>Thank you for your thoughtful and interesting letter of May 15.<note n="2" xml:id="d307fn2">A copy of this letter is ibid., DEF 4 NATO, attached to
                            a letter of transmittal from Ambassador Ridgway Knight to Rostow, also
                            dated May 15.</note> You are of course quite right that we are intensely
                        interested in carrying out the mandate of the NATO Council's Resolution
                        approving the Special <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0728"/>Group's
                        Report on the future tasks of the Alliance. Political developments during
                        the last few months make progress in this direction more urgent than ever
                        before. It is our hope that the June meeting will make constructive progress
                        at least on arms control and disarmament proposals, and on the question of
                        Mediterranean security.</p>
                    <p>We share your deep interest in the arms control question. Your letter came
                        just at the moment that we ourselves were submitting to Belgium and other
                        Alliance members our thoughts on the manner of dealing with the mutual force
                        reductions question at the forthcoming NATO Ministerial Meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3">The resolution was transmitted to the NATO capitals in
                            telegram 167504, May 21. (Ibid., DEF 6 NATO) The draft was subsequently
                            discussed at a North Atlantic Council Permanent Representatives luncheon
                            on May 22 where reaction to the U.S. initiative was “unanimously”
                            favorable, but reaction to the language of the draft was unfavorable, it
                            being too formal and too much like a U.N. resolution. (Telegram 3173
                            from Brussels, May 23; ibid.) Further discussion produced a shorter
                            resolution in line with the draft proposed by the United States, which
                            was attached to the final communique of the June 24–25 North Atlantic
                            Council meeting at Reykjavik, Iceland. For text, see Department of State
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 15, 1968, p. 75.</note>
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> will probably have informed
                        you by now of a draft resolution which we are suggesting for consideration
                        in NATO.</p>
                    <p>We believe our suggestions would go far toward meeting the purposes you have
                        in mind, although in a different form from that proposed by your government
                        following the discussions between Belgium and Poland. With regard to the
                        latter, we wonder if the specific Belgian suggestions might not best be
                        examined as part of the detailed studies on regional arms control problems
                        now being made in NATO. I understand that though progress is being made in
                        these studies, they will not be completed in time for the Reykjavik meeting.
                        In part for this reason we decided to put forward our suggestions for a
                        general resolution which ministers might adopt at Reykjavik. We fully agree
                        with your thought that our objective at Reykjavik should be to promote a
                        meaningful dialogue with the Soviet Union and the states of Eastern Europe,
                        and not to score a polemical point in the field of propaganda. Our
                        consultations should help to clarify and orient all separate talks with
                        colleagues from Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed your letter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> who shares your view of the importance of frank
                        discussions among ministers in a relatively informal setting during the
                        meetings of the North Atlantic Council. We believe that specific
                        arrangements to facilitate the work of the ministers at Reykjavik can best
                        be worked out through our Permanent Representatives, and I have therefore
                        asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> to keep in
                        particular close touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De
                            Staercke</persName> to pursue your suggestion.</p>
                    <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0729"/>
                    <p>It is as always a pleasure to hear from you. I'm sorry we have not had a
                        chance to meet for several months.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary welcomed Barre, saying we were always interested to know what
                        was happening in the Commission and the Six. Mr. Barre replied he was happy
                        to be here and have an opportunity to exchange views with State, Treasury
                        and the Federal Reserve. Such a dialogue was necessary to achieve better
                        mutual understanding. This was essential as we shared the burden of the
                        world economy together.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">July 1 Tariff Cuts</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, referring to press speculation, asked whether it was Mr.
                        Barre's impression there would be no change regarding the tariff cuts
                        scheduled for July 1. Mr. Barre replied he was certain there would be no
                        change. Agriculture Minister Edgar Faure, at the recent <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Council of <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0730"/>Ministers following agreement on the dairy <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>, announced there would be no objection to
                        fulfilling the commitments including the external commitments. Despite the
                        fact that the cost of settling the strike will be high, we have enough
                        reserves, said Mr. Barre, to enable us not to modify our commercial and
                        monetary policy. As a Frenchman, he said, I am hopeful this policy would be
                        maintained.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had been nervous that the social costs of the events
                        might lead to a modification of the July 1 commitments. Mr. Barre replied
                        that in France there are protectionist forces, which as July 1 approached,
                        began questioning the ability of France to face competition in order to
                        change the economic structure. Perhaps if there are major political changes,
                        the policy of liberalization may be changed. But if no such changes take
                        place he was confident in France's adhering to its commitments.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">European Reaction to U.S. Tax Bill </p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if it was Mr. Barre's expectation that passage of our tax
                        bill would be welcomed in Europe. Mr. Barre replied that he had said at the
                        combined meeting earlier that day that, if the bill were passed, the
                        international financial community, especially in Europe, would be confident
                        that a crisis could be avoided. He said the impression in Europe would be
                        that the U.S. has finally gained control of its balance of payments. This
                        was very important for the international monetary system.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"> UK Entry into the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether Mr. Barre saw any possibility that the recent
                        events, which, he emphasized, we did not enjoy, might make any change in the
                        prospects of UK entry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that he was not sure this was the case. In France and in
                        other parts of Europe there was a conflict between emotions and reason when
                        it came to UK entry. We are all confident, said Mr. Barre, that the UK will
                        one day be admitted to the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. But all feel,
                        he said, that the UK cannot now assume the obligations of the Treaty. The
                        situation is different from 1958 when the Six were entering a period of
                        constructing the Community. Today the Common Market is built and it is
                        difficult to conceive a situation in which one member would have a massive
                        exceptional situation. Mr. Barre said he had agreed with the Commission on
                        the need for consultations and negotiations with the UK. But the French
                        government said one could not begin negotiating without knowing the end of
                        the negotiation. Personally, he, Barre, regretted that the British were too
                        quick to apply. If the UK had taken measures to restore equilibrium and
                        confidence before applying, there would have been a more favorable
                        answer.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Elections in the West</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that a number of NATO governments were in
                        transition. The U.S., France, Italy, Belgium were all in the process of
                        changing governments. He asked if Mr. Barre foresaw any difficulties for the
                        Common Market because Italy and Belgium were without governments. Mr. Barre
                        replied the Common Market was accustomed to having one or two countries
                        without governments. He pointed out the recent agricultural decisions had
                        been taken without a Belgian government. He thought it was possible to take
                        some routine decisions this year. The big decisions pertaining to the second
                        stage in the development of the Community—the creation of the economic union
                        would be taken next year. But, he remarked, next year there will be German
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that Khrushchev once said “someone in the West is
                        always having those damned elections.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Political Questions Facing U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, after remarking that economic and technical issues would be
                        discussed thoroughly in Mr. Barre's other conversations, asked what key
                        political questions Mr. Barre's colleagues would be likely to ask on his
                        return to Europe. He offered to try to answer any such questions Mr. Barre
                        might have. But he could not answer the question who will be the next
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre remarked that he would not interfere in internal political
                        questions. He said that on the political side there were two questions or
                        rather hopes in Europe. One hope is that it will be possible for the U.S. to
                        arrive at a satisfactory settlement on Vietnam. The second hope was that
                        social and racial equilibrium would be maintained in the United States in
                        the next months. He said that the friends of the U.S. in Europe believe that
                        international equilibrium is linked to these two matters.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Social and Racial Problems</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied on the second point that no clear solution was probable
                        in a matter of months. These were not problems of stagnation but problems of
                        movement. Progress in this field stimulates action and sometimes violence.
                        However, while much progress has been achieved, the most difficult parts of
                        the problem were not resolved. Those aspects depending on attitudes and
                        personal feelings rather than on laws and personal feelings were most
                        difficult and will take more time. But, he emphasized, these are problems of
                        movement and, not of stagnation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam </p>
                    <p>As for the first point, the Secretary said, much will depend on how the
                        conflict in Vietnam will be settled. Many Europeans ask the wrong question,
                        he said. They ask whether they should support the U.S. in Vietnam. <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0732"/>It is easy to say that the U.S. is
                        big and stupid, but no matter what happens U.S. power will insulate Europe
                        from South East Asia. The Europeans should be asking two other questions
                        instead. First, what sort of Asia is in the interest of Europe, i.e., in
                        terms of hard national self-interest? Second, what is the interest of Europe
                        in the fidelity of the United States to its security commitments? On the
                        latter question, the Secretary said there is no theory of the master race in
                        this country which says NATO—yes, Asia—no. Europe has a big stake in the
                        answer to the second question. To settle Vietnam in terms which would
                        signify abandonment would be tragic for Europe. Europe has a big stake in
                        not seeing America revert to isolationism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that as a Frenchman he understood our difficult problem
                        very well. He had experienced this sort of problem in Indochina, in Tunisia,
                        and Algeria. He understood that the U.S. cannot accept a settlement at any
                        price. He expressed the hope that the U.S. would reach a settlement enabling
                        us to maintain our cooperation with the rest of the world and not revert to
                        isolationism. As he had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>, it would be a great danger if the U.S. should
                        lose interest in the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we must be interested in peace both in the Atlantic and
                        Pacific areas. During World War II we first defeated Hitler, then we
                        defeated Japan. The second task was accomplished without much assistance
                        from Europe or resources from the European theater, which was an indication
                        of how high a second priority this task was given in the U.S. We have
                        alliances with many countries. We are concerned what Peking and the
                        government of North Korea as well as the government of North Vietnam will
                        feel about our reaction.</p>
                    <p>As for the chances of a settlement, the Secretary continued, this remains to
                        be seen. Unhappily, in the Paris talks everything is on the public record.
                        We have tried to engage the North Vietnamese in private conversation, but
                        they have so far refused. Nevertheless, we hope such talks could be started
                        soon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre remarked it was always a lengthy tedious process to negotiate with
                        the Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out it took one and one-half years to talk the fever
                        out of the Berlin crisis. The Cuban missile crisis was an exception because
                        by the nature of the crisis it had to be resolved quickly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre remarked it was a matter of considerable importance that the
                        conversations had begun.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that there now appears to be a broader understanding of
                        the situation. About 78% of the territory and 90% of the population of North
                        Vietnam are now free from bombing. Not one kilometer in South Vietnam is
                        free from bombing and Hanoi will not tell us what will happen if we stop the
                        bombing completely. They must tell us this <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0733"/>and no one else is in a position to tell us. We hope they
                        will someday, but they have not done so yet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre said there was considerable hope in Europe that the U.S. could
                        solve this problem. Europe has had the problem of decolonization. It is not
                        the same problem, but the two problems are confused in people's minds. That
                        is why many in France favor a quick and drastic solution to the Vietnam
                        problem. When he was in the French government during the Algerian war, there
                        were plenty of people willing to give advice on how to obtain peace but when
                        one actually looks for peace it is not so easy to attain it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he frequently points out to his European friends that if
                        forty Communist regiments were operating in Bavaria, Denmark, and Turkey,
                        there would have to be some bombing. Europeans readily understand this but
                        cannot understand bombing in Southeast Asia. For us, he said, the problem is
                        the same.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>'s Economic Policy </p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. Barre what significance the switch of <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> and Debre had for financial, economic
                        and monetary policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that the change took place just prior to his departure so
                        he had no first hand knowledge. He said he thought the change was made
                        because Debre had not been happy with the high cost of the social
                        settlement. Furthermore, he had not been in good health. It was necessary
                        especially now to have a finance minister with a cool mind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre and the Secretary agreed that this was a quality of <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">M. Couve de Murville</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre thought there would be no change in economic policy nor for that
                        matter in foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had
                        always been interested in financial and economic policies, and in the
                        reshuffle it appeared he was the right man for solving both internal and
                        international economic problems. He will be calm, efficient and devoted to
                        international cooperation. Speaking for himself, Mr. Barre said it was a
                        source of great confidence to him to see <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> in that post because of his fundamental orientation
                        toward liberalization of trade and payments and the maintenance of
                        competition.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Contagion of French Events </p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked to what extent the French events could be regarded as
                        being provoked by a virus which was contagious in Europe. Perhaps this was
                        true of the students elsewhere in Europe, but what about other parts of the
                        society?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that in France it was necessary to distinguish between a
                        small minority of anarchist students and the vast majority seeking reform
                        within a system of order. If we consider the social situation, <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0734"/>the unions were favorable to a cautious
                        economic rather than political settlement, but the workers were not. Union
                        leaders now are cautious about the instructions they give the workers as
                        they fear they may not be followed.</p>
                    <p>However, in other countries, Mr. Barre said, there is little danger of
                        contagion. One possible exception is Italy where a balance of political
                        forces has not been reestablished. Mr. Barre hoped that by fall the
                        Socialist party could come back to power. In Italy, the repercussions will
                        be social and political rather than in the area of labor relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre thought it was possible, barring a major political change which he
                        did not foresee, and assuming the economy got back to work, that in France
                        the social and economic consequences of this extraordinary crisis of anarchy
                        and revolutionary romanticism could be minimized. It will, however, be
                        necessary to make some changes in the French political scene. Frenchmen are
                        not accustomed to a lengthy stability of government. France is witnessing
                        many important and fundamental economic changes. Young people feel divorced
                        from the establishment. The population is irritated with the stable and
                        self-confident government with which they have no dialogue, Mr. Barre
                        said.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that we are in an important transitional period
                        with respect to our population. Half of our population cannot remember World
                        War II or the events leading up to it. When he lectures in universities, the
                        Secretary said, he realized that one half the students were in the fifth and
                        sixth grades when he became Secretary of State. In Eastern Europe the young
                        people have no interest in the ideology. Thus, when there are legitimate
                        grievances these can spread. In this country, most professors make clear
                        they regard their students as a nuisance and would rather be at an
                        all-faculty institution such as All-Souls. In Europe in the universities,
                        the traditional system under which the senior professors dominate the
                        departments leaves no place for bright young men. These real problems spread
                        into other areas and provide the foundation for frivolity.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Youth and the Common Market</p>
                    <p>The Secretary felt that young people should be more involved in NATO and
                        other major international efforts. He asked, does the Common Market succeed
                        in engaging the interest of persons 25 and 30 years of age in the problems
                        of European construction?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that this question had been discussed in the Commission. He
                        had pointed out that when he discussed Common Market problems in the
                        universities, the older men discussed them in terms of self-interest. The
                        younger people, while not having an ideology, do have a will to build a new
                        society. In the transitional period in which we live, Mr. Barre continued,
                        all values are being questioned. No system of spiritual, <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0735"/>political and social values is immune. It
                        is, therefore, essential for younger people to find new reasons for life. It
                        was possible that, with new themes like European construction and aid to the
                        developing countries, which appeal to the spirit of generosity of youth, one
                        can orient them towards new achievements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">British Youth and the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled that earlier in the conversation Mr. Barre had said
                        the UK had acted too soon on its application. Some of his British friends
                        were concerned that the younger generation, disillusioned by Britain as a
                        world power, by Victorian Britain, and by the Britain of Churchill, were
                        becoming disoriented. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George Brown</persName>
                        thought that by taking Britain into Europe, the government would give
                        British youth a renewed elan and sense of purpose. He was worried that if
                        the British youth would become disillusioned with the prospects for Europe
                        they would not have anything. Therefore, the application was made sooner
                        rather than later. There was a good deal of fear that otherwise the
                        considerable support for British membership would erode.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barre replied that he had spoken with <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> and had advised him to build up support for entry into
                        Europe more progressively. It appeared to many Europeans despite the
                        considerable propaganda in the UK on Common Market entry, that no true
                        conversion had been achieved. In Europe, he said, it was asked whether the
                        British were really ready to become part of Europe. If there could be better
                        preparation, British chances would be better.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that in British tradition, the knight always slays the
                        dragon. And this time Sir <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George</persName> did
                        not succeed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary to Call on Commission in December </p>
                    <p>At this point the interview ended. The Secretary assured Mr. Barre that he
                        and his colleagues would be welcomed here and hoped he would have useful
                        talks. He said he planned to call on the Commission in December when in
                        Brussels for the NATO Ministerial Meeting.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that Europe is living with the “miracle” of
                        substantial US troop deployments there at the same time that the United
                        States is compelled to maintain large forces in Viet Nam. There is great
                        pressure in the Senate for a reduction in the size of US forces in Europe.
                        Many issues, such as our balance of payments and budget problems, which
                        might to the Europeans appear unrelated, are directly linked to the question
                        of the U.S. military presence in Europe. In this connection, the Secretary
                        thanked the Foreign Minister for the Danish decision to purchase US Treasury
                        securities, and said this was most helpful in countering the U.S. military
                        balance of payments deficit with Denmark.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it would also be helpful if Denmark and Germany would join
                        with the rest of the Fourteen to agree on the basis of NATO claims against
                        France arising from the removal of NATO facilities and personnel from that
                        country. The Secretary said that the exact timing of the approach to France
                        could be decided later. The Foreign Minister said that he would look into
                        the matter of NATO claims against France, and felt he could say that on this
                        matter Denmark would not leave itself in an isolated position.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the question of mutual force reductions would be
                        before the NATO Ministers in Reykjavik. He doubted that the Soviet Union and
                        its Warsaw Pact colleagues would be particularly <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0737"/>interested in holding discussions at this time. Events in
                        Eastern Europe may mean that the Soviet Union will attach even greater
                        importance to the maintenance of forces in East Germany. Also, the USSR
                        would wish to avoid a charge, by Communist China, that it is permitting the
                        US to release troops from Europe for service in Southeast Asia. However,
                        NATO agreement that any troop reductions should be mutual will help the US
                        hold the line against demands for a unilateral force reduction. The Foreign
                        Minister responded with the observation that the US and Denmark are in
                        agreement on the point that any force reductions should be mutual.</p>

                    <p>3403. Subject: Current face of the “French problem” in NATO.</p>
                    <p>1. As NATO approaches another Ministerial Meeting, the problems posed by the
                        basic French attitude toward NATO are again accentuated.</p>
                    <p>2. The principal elements in the “French problem” on the eve of the Reykjavik
                        Ministerial Meeting are the following:</p>
                    <p>a. The prospective inability of the French to join other NATO members in
                        agreeing on action proposals now being shaped up in two major fields: (1)
                        recommendations on the Mediterranean (paper being drafted by SYG for
                        examination by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on June 11); and (2) the
                        resolution on mutual force reductions (initiated by the US and under
                        consideration in informal meetings of PermReps chaired by <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>).</p>
                    <p>b. The adverse impact of the French position on the solidarity of the
                        Fourteen on substance of various issues, leading some of them in particular
                        to water-down their substantive positions in the hope of finding a meeting
                        point with the French.</p>
                    <p>c. The search for formulas for moving ahead with NATO action proposals on the
                        Mediterranean and mutual force reductions if French agreement is not
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>3. The pattern has much the same setting as the discussions of NATO action on
                        the Harmel Report just prior to the Ministerial Meeting <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0738"/>of December 1967. In that case, of course,
                        the French in the end did join in the Ministerial action on the report.
                        However, the current issues much more clearly involve action recommendations
                        by Ministers. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> is in effect
                        underscoring this point by saying, with the advantage of hindsight and
                        probably as an explanation to the Quai, that the French had understood that
                        any action requirement arising from Harmel Report last December to involve
                        only “studies”.</p>
                    <p>4. With respect to the solidarity of the Fourteen, in the last discussion
                            (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> 3372)<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">Telegram 3372, June 6, summarized a June 6 meeting in
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s office devoted to the
                            draft resolution on mutual force reductions. (Ibid., DEF 6 NATO)</note>
                        on the mutual force reduction resolution, Belgian PermRep <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De Staercke</persName> showed a very substantial
                        readiness to restructure the draft proposal by reducing or perhaps
                        eliminating the “signal” contained in paragraph 5. Others of the Fourteen,
                        including the Canadians and the British, are also looking for substantive
                        adjustments which they hope might enable the French to go along. As for the
                        Council recommendations to the Ministers on the Mediterranean—the paper
                        which is to accompany the now virtually agreed assessment of the
                        Mediterranean situation—the impact of the expected French opposition to the
                        draft recommendations <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> is
                        preparing will no doubt lead some of the Fourteen to similar efforts to
                        reduce the substantive content of the recommendations.</p>
                    <p>5. The immediate tactical problem we face is to maintain support by the
                        Fourteen for meaningful substantive proposals in these two major areas until
                        the French take clearer positions on the substance, either indicating, as
                        does not appear to us very likely, a readiness to join in such substantive
                        actions or, as is much more likely, their inability to do so.</p>
                    <p>6. As to the formulas for going ahead on these major problems without French
                        support, the chief possibilities are:</p>
                    <p>a. Further resort by the French to the “hands-off” or “constructive
                        abstention” formula employed this week in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> by the French in relation to the approval of the study on
                        the security of Malta (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> 3366).<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">Dated June 6. (Ibid., NATO 3–1)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>b. Remanding of issues to <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> for formal
                        action, an approach suggested by <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName>, but not adopted, with respect to NATO consultations
                        with the Maltese and the ad hoc group designed to back-stop these
                        consultations (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> 3190).<note n="4" xml:id="d310fn4">Dated May 24. (Ibid., DEF 4 NATO)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> has gone to Paris for
                        weekend consultations, which will include this range of problems. Before his
                        departure, in discussion a trois with UK PermRep Burrows and Cargo, he
                        stressed French aversion to “action” proposals for NATO Ministerial Meeting
                        and indicated considerable <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0739"/>doubt
                        that Paris would be able to agree to any kind of “signal” to Soviets and
                        Eastern European countries on mutual force reductions, or even to studies by
                        military authorities on action possibilities with respect to the
                        Mediterranean looking to later recommendations to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SCR1">Seydoux</persName> seemed to think French might apply
                        “hands-off” or “constructive abstention” formula to Mediterranean
                        recommendations, noting that most of these would be in military field in any
                        event. He did not seem to think, however, that France would be able to stand
                        aside on the public mutual force reductions resolution. He was interested in
                        possible DPC approach, but did not attempt forecast whether Paris would take
                        this view.</p>
                    <p>8. Handling of these two major issues, or parts of them, by Fourteen action
                        would pose some procedural problems. If the “hands-off” or “constructive
                        abstention” technique were followed to and through the Reykjavik meeting,
                        some new formula would need to be worked out for the communique. Approach
                        involving <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> action would presumably
                        require a session at Reykjavik of Ministers sitting as the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. However, a communique pattern for this has
                        already been established.</p>
                    <p>9. Above are general outlines of “French problem” as it now appears. There is
                        also some additional underbrush, as with French reservations on para 27 of
                        the commentary on the <gloss target="#t_EW1">E/W</gloss> relations paper
                            (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> 3310),<note n="5" xml:id="d310fn5">Dated June 4. (Ibid., NATO 3)</note> which may or may
                        not be lesser example of the same basic problem. Sharper focus will
                        inevitably be drawn on substance and procedure with respect specific issues
                        during discussions early next week.</p>

                    <p>The third ministerial session of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, held at The
                        Hague on April 18–19, and the subsequent meeting of the <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0740"/>nominal parent organization, the Nuclear
                        Defense Affairs Committee, on May 10, gave further evidence of the success
                        of the Alliance framework for nuclear consultations which was formally
                        established in December 1966 and which is now approaching the end of its
                        first membership cycle. This report outlines the work which has been
                        accomplished by these groups.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Abstract</p>
                    <p>West European uneasiness regarding the lack of opportunity for serious and
                        continuing discussion with Americans on sensitive aspects of the nuclear
                        resources and policies of the West became particularly apparent in the early
                        1960's, aggravated by talk of a “missile gap,” by extended tensions over
                        Berlin, and by misconceptions about the US strategy of “flexible response.”
                        The eventual recognition of this uneasiness led to the establishment in 1965
                        of the ad hoc Special Committee in NATO to study ways to improve and extend
                        allied participation in planning for the use of nuclear weapons. The success
                        of this body led in December 1966 to the organization of the present
                        permanent framework for consideration of general policy questions on the
                        nuclear defense of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>This framework consists of an open-ended group of defense ministers, the
                        Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee (<gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>),
                        and a smaller, nominally subordinate body to accomplish the detailed work,
                        the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG). Membership on the NPG was limited to seven
                        allies, which by informal agreement will always include the United States,
                        the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy. Another part
                        of that agreement was a rotational scheme whereby other interested NATO
                        members serve on the NPG alternately.</p>
                    <p>During the past year and a half, the NPG has met three times at the level of
                        defense ministers, and the <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> has met
                        twice, to endorse NPG decisions. NPG representatives have also met
                        frequently at sub-ministerial levels to continue deliberations and carry out
                        assigned studies. The work of the <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>/NPG
                        has fallen into three broad categories, dealing with strategic nuclear
                        forces, with tactical nuclear forces, and with national participation in
                        nuclear planning.</p>
                    <p>In the first category, the NPG has concentrated on a consideration of the
                        feasibility of an anti-ballistic missile deployment in NATO Europe. On the
                        basis of studies which pointed up the lack of guaranteed effectiveness and
                        the high cost of such a defensive system, NPG ministers in their most recent
                        session agreed that a European <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment was not warranted at present, but that the matter should be kept
                        under continuing review. This decision was subsequently endorsed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>A considerable part of the deliberations of the NPG has centered on tactical
                        nuclear weapons. It was agreed early that the relative advantages <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0741"/>of particular weapons systems and
                        the circumstances in which they might be used required further detailed
                        study in order to insure the most effective utilization of their deterrent
                        value. Proposals for the introduction of one such weapon, atomic demolition
                        munitions (<gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s), have received considerable
                        attention, [1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified].</p>
                    <p>The original enthusiasm of the Turks for <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>s
                        has disappeared, however, as they became aware of the improbability of
                        obtaining pre-delegated authority for the release of the weapons, which they
                        consider a domestic political necessity, and of the possibly negative
                        effects of such plans on the limited Soviet-Turkish detente. [6 lines of
                        source text not declassified]</p>
                    <p>The principal work which the NPG is now undertaking is the development of a
                        set of tentative political “guidelines” for the use of tactical nuclear
                        weapons, which will draw on the studies currently underway on specific
                        weapons systems and contingency situations. European members have been
                        particularly anxious to engage in such a project and have become
                        increasingly impatient with the US desire to concentrate primarily on the
                        underlying studies, from which a widely-applicable doctrine of use could
                        later be gradually developed. NPG ministers in April agreed that work begin
                        on the development of tentative guidelines for the possible initial use of
                        tactical nuclear weapons under the following circumstances: 1) use for
                        demonstrative purposes; 2) use of defensive systems; 3) use at sea; and 4)
                        selective use against battlefield targets in a limited conflict. There
                        remains a good deal of skepticism among some European NATO members about
                        whether the initiation by NATO of any use of tactical nuclear weapons in
                        Europe will ever be found to be feasible.</p>
                    <p>The recent approval by the NPG and <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> of
                        recommendations by NATO's Military Committee will provide additional
                        opportunities for participation by European allies in military nuclear
                        planning at various NATO command levels, a process which began with the
                        internationalization of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>'s nuclear
                        planning staff in 1963. NPG ministers in April also agreed to the general
                        principle that in nuclear consultations special weight should be given to
                        the views of those countries “most directly affected.” This was in
                        recognition of German concerns regarding the role of host countries in the
                        release of nuclear weapons for use from or on their own territory. The
                        German acceptance of the present <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>/NPG
                        machinery, in lieu of previous, more ambitious proposals for exercising a
                        wider role in nuclear defense, has been an important factor in its
                        success.</p>
                    <p>The decision to undertake the development of political “guidelines” for the
                        use of tactical nuclear weapons will now confront the NPG with some of the
                        most difficult questions of nuclear policy, such as a definition of the
                        “nuclear threshold.” At the same time, our European allies are still <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0742"/>urging that the US make more
                        specific its commitment to consult with them before an actual decision to
                        use nuclear weapons in Western Europe is made. (A few would like to extend
                        the consultation issue to the subject of arrangements for NATO coordination
                        on general “crisis management”.) The United States has insisted that any
                        refinement of the exact procedures for such consultations would be
                        meaningless until there exists an accepted concept for the use of tactical
                        nuclear weapons, one with clearly defined options which are understood by
                        those with whom the US would be consulting in a crisis. This, then, is the
                        task which the NPG has now set for itself and which will occupy its primary
                        attention for the immediate future. But the machinery for achieving
                        increased involvement in planning for the nuclear defense of NATO Europe has
                        already been tested and found worthwhile by those NATO allies which have
                        chosen to participate in it. As long as the United States continues to share
                        some of its responsibility for nuclear planning with them, it is unlikely,
                        especially in the present atmosphere of East-West detente in Europe, that
                        these allies will make serious attempts to revamp drastically the Alliance's
                        nuclear arrangements.</p>

                    <p rend="center">A. Background</p>
                    <p>The North Atlantic Council, in Ministerial session of Foreign Ministers will
                        meet in Reykjavik, Iceland, June 24–25. This will be the first time that
                        Iceland, a small but strategically located country of 200,000 people, has
                        been the host for a NATO meeting.</p>
                    <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0743"/>
                    <p>This session takes place less than one year before the 20th anniversary of
                        the creation of NATO as a defense Alliance to deter aggression against
                        Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>As the Soviet Union emerged from Stalinist influence, the nature of the
                        threat changed. Today, the polycentric tendencies within the Communist
                        world, the evolution of Soviet society, plus affluence in the West, obscure
                        the fact that mounting Soviet capabilities still pose a danger to Western
                        European security.</p>
                    <p>Europe, long ago recovered from the effects of World War II, now faces
                        problems common to affluent societies. Stable, prosperous and slightly smug,
                        Western Europe has suddenly broken out in a rash of political and social
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>Among NATO members, France and Canada will have elections at the time of the
                        NATO meeting. Italy and Belgium are trying to form governments. The US is in
                        the process of preparing for Presidential elections. Greece is confronted
                        with a junta looking for a nationally approved constitution. The faltering
                        British pound has created heavy pressure on the international monetary
                        system. Despite all this, most of Europe has ample foreign exchange reserves
                        and remains confident and firm. The economic structure is essentially
                        sound.</p>
                    <p>In this atmosphere, NATO's continued functioning on a broad front—military
                        and political—constitutes a welcome element of stability, despite some
                        strains within the Alliance.</p>
                    <p rend="center">B. Principal Issues at Reykjavik</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>The Ministers will discuss the general question of East-West relations. Views
                        will be exchanged on recent developments in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and
                        Berlin. It is expected that the German Foreign Minister will report on the
                        Federal Republic's relations with Eastern European countries in furtherance
                        of its Ost-Politik. The improvement of relations between East and West, and
                        such matters as European security, will also be discussed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Mediterranean Security</p>
                    <p>Security developments in the Mediterranean will be an important issue in the
                        meeting. The Ministers will address particularly the impact on NATO, and the
                        NATO area, of increasing Soviet penetration into the Mediterranean. Ways and
                        means of countering this growing military power in the Mediterranean will
                        also be examined and recommendations considered on increased surveillance by
                        NATO countries of USSR fleet movements, and the adoption of a watching brief
                        for Brosio.</p>
                    <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0744"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Mutual Force Reductions</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Ministers will also take up mutual force reductions. In February
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> indicated to NATO
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> that “maintenance of
                        NATO's strength, including the US commitment, is necessary to continuing
                        stability and security in the North Atlantic area. This stability and
                        security provides the basis for exploring with the USSR the possibility of
                        mutual force reductions.” This question is under intensive study within
                        NATO. The US has proposed for consideration at Reykjavik a resolution
                        (declaration) on this issue which indicates NATO is studying the problem,
                        expresses the hope that the USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe will
                        also study it and be prepared at the proper time to explore such reductions
                        together. The overall military capability of the Alliance should not be
                        reduced except as a part of a pattern of mutual force reductions balanced in
                        scope and timing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The negotiations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have been the
                        subject of intensive consultations in NATO. The Germans and others wish to
                        discuss some of the implications of this Treaty at Reykjavik. The
                        non-nuclear NATO powers have been concerned that their signing the Treaty
                        would impair their security, especially in the nuclear field, particularly
                        should the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> duration outlast NATO. We
                        have tried to meet their legitimate concerns and persuade them to support
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and are prepared to make a
                        supporting statement at Reykjavik on our continued commitment to NATO as an
                        instrument for peace and stability in Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Other Matters</p>
                    <p>General tour d'horizon—the meeting will permit each Foreign Minister to give
                        his views of the overall international situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> plans to meet in restricted session to
                        discuss Vietnam and the European views on what they would like to see
                        develop in Southeast Asia after peace is achieved.</p>
                    <p rend="center">C. Long Range Problems and Outlook for the Future</p>
                    <p>Above and beyond the issues on the official agenda at Reykjavik, certain
                        general problems confront NATO:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Future Viability of NATO </p>
                    <p>Foremost among these is the question of the future of the Alliance. French
                        withdrawal from the integrated military aspects of NATO in 1966 caused many
                        skeptics to doubt at that time whether the Alliance would have continued
                        viability. The work of the organization since then has demonstrated that it
                        can adjust to new conditions and continue as the <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0745"/>keystone of Western collective security even without French
                        participation in its military aspects.</p>
                    <p>We anticipate that there will be continued support for NATO by the member
                        governments. The governments participating in its military structure
                        continue to recognize that collective security is the most effective way to
                        ensure national security. The French attitude notwithstanding, we do not
                        anticipate any members will take advantage of Article XIII of the North
                        Atlantic Treaty and give notice of withdrawal after its anniversary date (20
                        years) in 1969.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Greece</p>
                    <p>Developments in Greece with the take-over of the government by a military
                        junta have strained the bonds of the Alliance. Many NATO governments,
                        notably in Scandinavia, and Low Countries and the UK have been sharply
                        critical of the Greek regime. Pressures have been exerted in these countries
                        to isolate Greece within the Alliance, if not to expel it, pending a return
                        to constitutionality. While Greece remains a full, interested and essential
                        participant in the Alliance, the Greek problem remains as a divisive
                        factor.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Burden Sharing</p>
                    <p>We keep trying to persuade the Europeans to increase their own defense
                        efforts in various ways, but this effort has met with little positive
                        response to date. Nevertheless, we have negotiated successfully with some of
                        our Allies on a bilateral basis in order to neutralize the balance of
                        payments impact of our military expenditures. Arrangements for substantial
                        neutralization have been concluded with the Germans and the Belgians.
                        Similar arrangements are well on the way to completion with the Danes, the
                        Dutch and the Italians.</p>
                    <p rend="center">D. Reykjavik and the Continued Importance of NATO to US </p>
                    <p> NATO remains essential to US security:</p>
                    <p>1. In view of the current pattern of Soviet activity and current developments
                        affecting Western and Eastern political stability, it is even more essential
                        that the US maintain a consistent policy of support for a strong NATO.</p>
                    <p>2. While maintaining this support, we must also be flexible enough to ensure
                        that the Alliance is responsive to opportunities for easing tensions in
                        Europe. NATO can become an increasingly effective instrument of detente.</p>
                    <p>3. We shall continue to study within NATO the possibilities for exploring,
                        with the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe, mutual force
                        reductions. Concentration will be primarily on the Central Region of NATO in
                        light of the heavy confrontation there of forces of <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0746"/>NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Meanwhile,
                        consistent with the President's discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> last February, we should strive to maintain overall
                        NATO military strength. Unilateral troop reductions could undermine current
                        efforts toward a balanced mutual reduction of forces.</p>
                    <p>4. In the Mediterranean area, we see the Soviet threat as being primarily
                        political, and we are recommending a set of modest, non-provocative
                        political-military responses by NATO to this threat.</p>
                    <p>5. Through the mechanism of the Nuclear Planning Group, we are studying ways
                        for increased national participation—and thereby understanding—in military
                        nuclear planning and for developing a sounder basis for NATO military
                        planning with respect to the use of tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>6. We shall continue to try to work out arrangements to neutralize the
                        effects of our military presence in Europe upon our balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>7. We are committed through CY 1968 on US force levels in NATO. These US
                        forces in Europe contribute to both the nuclear and conventional defense of
                        the North Atlantic area. The US forces in Europe are a part of NATO's
                        conventional defenses as well as acting as custodians for the tactical
                        nuclear weapons that we maintain there. They also provide an essential
                        institutional link between NATO's conventional forces, largely supplied by
                        the Europeans, and the strategic nuclear weapons which are almost wholly
                        American. In addition, these units are an earnest of American leadership in
                        the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>8. For the future we must examine means for getting greater European
                        participation in the defense of Europe, such as a European Defense
                        Organization, or capitalizing on the U.K. interest in the Continent as the
                        result of its withdrawals East of Suez.</p>

                    <p rend="center">WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19, 1968, 12:00 NOON</p>
                    <p>The President opened the meeting by noting the forthcoming NATO Ministerial
                        Meeting at Reykjavik. He asked Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> to introduce the discussion.</p>
                    <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0747"/>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said the
                        Ministerial Meeting was taking place against unhappy background—the
                        difficulties in France, the lack of a government in Belgium, and the Berlin
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, NATO recently had been debated in Norway and the
                        Norwegians strongly voted for continued support of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>By way of introduction, <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said
                        that NATO is in a better state of health than the pessimists predicted a few
                        years ago. It had been effective in coordinating the discussion among the
                        governments on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and the Nuclear
                        Planning Group was moving along well.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the specific issues at Reykjavik, he said:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi> would be the subject of serious bilateral and
                        quadripartite discussion among the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany. The
                        Secretary is considering going to Bonn after the meeting.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Mutual Force Reductions</hi>—we expect to have a
                        ministerial declaration that NATO is willing to undertake troop reductions
                        on a reciprocal basis with the Russians. The French will not join but that
                        will not matter.</p>
                    <p>We do not expect the Russians to respond now. Vietnam is one reason; their
                        concern over Eastern Europe is another. But the declaration may provide a
                        platform for talks with the Russians on this issue, and progress is possible
                        in the longer term.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi>—We anticipate some low key actions. The
                        Soviet threat there is primarily political and secondarily military. The
                        Ministers will authorize increased surveillance.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        </hi>—We hope for a NATO statement on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and we have worked out a scenario reaffirming our
                        commitment to help others support the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                        (The scenario was subsequently approved by the President.)</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>—May give the Germans some ammunition to delay
                        signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments and Burden Sharing</hi>—Our present
                        arrangements to offset the balance of payments costs for our troops in NATO
                        are temporary. They buy time but they don't cure the problem. Over the
                        longer term we look for the British to do more in Europe which could enable
                        us to do less. We can also anticipate the UK working toward some kind of
                        joint European military effort—including joint production of military
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>—Thus far the Germans have not been willing to
                        take countermeasures. They have no reason therefore to blame us for the
                        crisis. We must try to build up support for West Berlin. High level visits
                        would help.</p>
                    <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0748"/>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        </hi>—We hope the Germans could be persuaded to go along. If they don't, it
                        will raise specters in Europe.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi>—The Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean
                        has recently been reduced but it is active and must be carefully watched. A
                        joint NATO Naval exercise is being planned.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Mutual Force Reductions</hi>—The Germans want to have
                        language in NATO statements ruling out any unilateral troop reductions. We
                        can't do this, particularly in view of the rising sentiment in the Congress
                        that we do something in this field. At the Defense Ministers meeting we had
                        told the Europeans they should prepare for future reduction. Our language at
                        Reykjavik on this issue should go on further than the May 10 Defense
                        Ministers' statement.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>—We should resume military aid to Greece. The
                        importance of our military position there has increased as a result of the
                        Soviet presence in the Mediterranean. The Greeks are cooperative and will be
                        of more value to us if Turkey makes trouble.</p>
                    <p>The President asked for comments on the issue of resuming military aid to
                        Greece. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>,
                        the Vice President, and Helms agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Burden Sharing</hi>—Our position is still not
                        satisfactory. Bond purchases help but we must get to some better arrangement
                        in the future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>We still haven't built a financial pillar for the Alliance. Our arrangements
                        are neither satisfactory nor enduring. The only meaningful way of dealing
                        with this problem over the long term is through increased purchases of U.S.
                        military equipment by the Europeans or reduced U.S. military expenditure in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that the
                        Germans have an enormous need for new military aircraft. We should be able
                        to work something out in the area of joint production of new planes.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary Nitze discussed the prospects for the F–5 and estimated that
                        the total market for a new military plane in Germany might be as much as $3
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>The President asked State and Treasury to review the status of this project
                        with Defense.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said we would have a very nervous time until Congress goes home
                        for the political conventions. The troop reduction issue may come up as an
                        amendment to the defense appropriations bill. The vote would be very close
                        in the Senate. The Secretary noted there was a real move toward isolationism
                        in the Senate. Some of the same Senators who wanted us to get out of Vietnam
                        wanted us out of Europe. He thought it a miracle that we had been able to
                        maintain our level of forces in Europe while we had hundreds of thousands of
                        troops in Southeast Asia. The Secretary said we were trying to divert
                        Congressional concern with <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss> but we were
                        not sanguine about the results. He regretted that there had been press
                        speculation to the effect that it was our motive to deflect Congressional
                        intent with <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>. He would find it very
                        helpful if a good statement tying the removal of any forces to Soviet moves
                        could come out of this NATO meeting. He saw one problem. We could live with
                        the language adopted at the meeting of defense ministers on maintaining NATO
                        military capability, but if there was a reference to unilateral reductions
                        it would appear to be a challenge to the Congress of the United States. The
                        Secretary said we would prefer more general language. He assured the German
                        Foreign Minister that the President had no intention to withdraw combat
                        forces from Europe or to dismantle NATO.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he thought the Secretary's
                        request reasonable. The Germans were very much for mutual force reductions
                        since any discussion <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0750"/>of mutual
                        force reductions would influence developments in Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed with this observation. He said we could accept all three
                        of the drafts that had been prepared including the German one if the last
                        sentence in the German draft, which referred to unilateral withdrawals, were
                        dropped.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said he found the US proposed
                        text better if the last sentence in the German draft was to be dropped.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said that he wished to make an
                        additional observation to the effect that some of our friends were not aware
                        of developments if a regrouping of forces did take place in Europe. It would
                        leave the German Army with a bigger role than might be desirable. He said
                        some cynical people have said that the German Army should be able to impress
                        the Byelo-Russians without frightening Luxembourg.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> if he had
                        discussed a new defense grouping within NATO with the British.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> said there had been no real
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said it seemed to us more
                        important to have discussions in view of British moves out of the area East
                        of Suez.</p>
                    <p> Ruete did not believe the British would raise this subject tonight.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he assumed that he would make the opening statement in the
                        Senate, including the interpretations. This statement would represent the
                        official position of the United States. He said we have warned the Soviets
                        that if they contradict our interpretations, we may not have a treaty. He
                        suggested that his opening statement in the Senate could be transmitted by
                        him in a communication addressed to each NATO Foreign Minister and to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> thought this would be very
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said his opening statement would become part of the legislative
                        history of the treaty.</p>
                    <p> Ruete asked how such a statement would bind the next administration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied as far as the treaty was concerned, a change of
                        administration would have no effect. He gave it as his opinion that neither
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> nor Nixon nor
                        Rockefeller would take a different view from the present administration.</p>

                        President expressed himself quite strongly on the question of U.S. troop
                        cuts in Europe, and I thought it would be helpful background information for
                        you on the eve of your Bonn visit tomorrow. The subject arose because
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark Clifford</persName> had had a
                        discouraging talk with Senator Russell this morning in which Russell
                        indicated his inclination to support the Symington amendment.<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">On April 19, in the debate on the Military Procurement
                            Bill, Senator Stuart Symington announced that he would introduce the
                            following amendment to the Military Appropriation Bill when it came
                            before the Senate: “After December 31, 1968, no appropriation authorized
                            by this or any other Act may be used to support more than 50,000 members
                            of the Armed Forces of the United States on the continent of Europe.”
                            (Memorandum to the Secretary of State, July 9; Department of State, SIG
                            Files: Lot 74 D 164)</note> The President said that he would have no
                        part of dismantling voluntarily our essential troop structure in Europe
                        before he left office next January and if he had to have a “war with
                        Russell” to maintain options for his successor, he would be willing to do
                        so. When <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark</persName> mentioned the
                        possibility of non-combat troop withdrawals, I indicated that we are looking
                        at that closely. Bus Wheeler <note n="4" xml:id="d315fn4">Chairman of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle G. Wheeler.</note> said that he had

                        to the USSR to encourage it to prepare for future discussions on the
                        possibility of mutual force reductions in Europe, evidenced concern over
                        increased Soviet activities in the Mediterranean, and declared their
                        solidarity on the issue of access to Berlin. They thus concentrated on the
                        twin goals of insuring collective defense and promoting detente, which were
                        outlined in last December's Report on the Future Tasks of the Alliance (the
                        Harmel Report). While the Berlin declaration was adopted unanimously, France
                        partially disassociated itself from the actions and public statements
                        regarding force cuts and Mediterranean security.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">East-West Relations</hi>. In their general review of the
                        international situation, several ministers touched on the elusive nature of
                        detente, referring especially to continued evidence of the rigid posture of
                        the Soviet Union towards the West. Following consideration of a review of
                        East-West relations since 1966, prepared by the permanent Council as part of
                        the follow-up to the Harmel Report, there was a prolonged debate on how to
                        achieve a proper balance in communique references to detente. It was finally
                        agreed—as is usually the case in NATO discussions of this subject—that the
                        ministers would publicly reaffirm their intention to continue efforts to
                        promote detente, while warning that opportunities for rapid progress should
                        not be overrated. The ministers also restated their intention to continue
                        the examination and review of European security problems and to prepare for
                        the time when “fruitful discussions” of these questions might be possible
                        with the East, as originally called for in the Harmel Report.</p>
                    <p>Several members welcomed the recent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, but no
                        attempt was made at the meeting to reach agreement on a statement regarding
                        the treaty for inclusion in the communique.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0753"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mutual Force Reductions</hi>. In their major
                        detente-oriented action, all ministers confirmed the decision of the
                        permanent Council to give priority to the study, also undertaken as a Harmel
                        Report follow-up, of the possibility of balanced and mutual force reductions
                        by East and West. This provided the opportunity for the Fourteen to attempt
                        to counter domestic pressures for defense cuts by reaffirming recent
                        statements by NATO's Defense Planning Committee that the overall military
                        capacity of the Alliance should not be reduced except as part of mutual
                        force reductions. Belgian defense cuts announced last December and public
                        debate about possible defense reductions in Germany had aroused concern that
                        unilateral slashes by several NATO members might occur and that this could
                        lead to a general downward spiral of national commitments to and hardware
                        allocations for the common defense. Thus, the hope of heading off any
                        unilateral cuts, by stressing the need for reciprocity, and the desire to
                        reduce domestic budget-cutting pressures, by showing the public that NATO
                        was as forthcoming on arms control as could prudently be afforded, were
                        prime factors in renewing allied activity in the field of mutual East-West
                        force reductions, even though no member government expected Moscow to be
                        receptive to the idea at an early date.</p>
                    <p>Ministers of the Fourteen adopted a declaration on this subject which was
                        made public as an attachment to the ministerial communi-que, thus serving
                        notice that it was up to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European
                        countries also to begin preparations for possible future discussions. While
                        accepting the general statements in the declaration regarding hopes for
                        progress in the field of arms control and, more specifically, the
                        desirability of an East-West agreement on mutual force reductions, France
                        disassociated itself from those portions which specified the principles to
                        be followed in continuing the NATO study and which reaffirmed the need to
                        maintain the overall military capacity of the Alliance in the meantime. The
                        French did, however, affirm publicly their intention to continue to
                        participate in this NATO study.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mediterranean Security</hi>. Mindful of the fact that a
                        year has passed since a major expansion of Soviet naval presence in the
                        Mediterranean began, most members were anxious to give some evidence of the
                        Alliance's awareness that this Soviet activity could pose an additional
                        threat to its members' security. The most that could be agreed upon publicly
                        by all fifteen members was their approval of a Harmel follow-up report
                        dealing with “the situation in the Mediterranean” and their readiness to
                        extend consultations on this subject within NATO as circumstances required.
                        France would not concur in any reference to a Soviet threat as such and
                        disputed the need for specific recommendations by the ministers. It thus
                        disassociated itself from a further communique paragraph which expressed
                        allied concern over the recent expansion of <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0754"/>Soviet activity in the area and which noted that early
                        consideration would be given to measures designed to safeguard the security
                        interests of NATO members there, including increased surveillance
                        activities. Previous discussion within the permanent Council had made
                        apparent considerable apprehension that any specific measures undertaken
                        might seem unduly provocative to the Soviets or to the Arab nations.
                        Ministers of the Fourteen did agree, however, that activation of a NATO
                        maritime air surveillance command for the Mediterranean should be expedited.
                        They also instructed the permanent representatives to consider other
                        possible measures, including an expansion of allied military exercises in
                        the area and the formation of a standby multi-national naval force to be
                        available on call. These latter actions were not made public. Previous
                        discussions of the immediate formation of a NATO standing naval force for
                        the Mediterranean similar to that recently established in the Atlantic had
                        evidenced no support for this idea.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>. The NATO ministers also focused their
                        attention on the recent East German attempts to encroach on the political
                        and psychological position of West Berlin. All fifteen ministers approved
                        and publicly associated themselves with the expressed determination of the
                        US, the UK and France to maintain freedom of access to that city. The
                        ministerial communique called attention to Soviet responsibility for any
                        action which hampered or endangered free access to Berlin and urged that
                        such actions, which it called “a deliberate attempt to jeopardize detente,”
                        be discontinued. The statement adopted was based on a draft proposed by the
                        West Germans; even though Foreign Minister Brandt had been prepared, in case
                        of French opposition, to accept a Four-Power declaration on Berlin appended
                        to the NATO communique, approval by all NATO members was achieved.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. The NATO ministerial session just
                        concluded was relatively undramatic, as the principal items on the agenda,
                        viz., the three follow-up reports relating to aspects of the Harmel Study,
                        were approved and the recommendations accepted with few changes from the
                        drafts presented by the permanent representatives, who had succeeded in
                        making unusually thorough and effective preparations. Likewise, the French
                        reservations on these drafts had already been spelled out in full. The
                        position of France in NATO has thus remained consistent for over a year. It
                        is a rather reluctant ally. It seeks continued participation in the
                        political and many military discussions, consultations, and studies of the
                        Alliance, and it will often join in statements of general position. However,
                        it disassociates itself from almost all concrete actions or calls for
                        action, and from moves that imply a coordination of future policy, lest any
                        of this imply a subordination of French policy to the US or to others.</p>

                    <p>Relatively little notice was paid at this session to the approach of 1969 and
                        the opportunity that will legally become available to member governments to
                        give one year's notice of withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty. By
                        contrast, last December, with this date in mind, the ministers had given
                        emphasis to projecting the Alliance and its work well beyond that 20th
                        anniversary date. Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> did announce that he would soon seek North Atlantic
                        Council discussion on the public affairs handling of NATO's birthday
                        activities next year, but this was in response to several references by
                        ministers to the need to enhance further the NATO “image” and particularly
                        its appeal to youth, rather than in the context of withdrawal rights. Other
                        speakers referred to continued public support for NATO membership, while
                        only the Portuguese Foreign Minister mentioned specifically that 1969 would
                        pre-sent the question of whether his country could remain bound to the North
                        Atlantic Treaty, as presently written. Thus, as the Alliance focuses ever
                        more attentively on detente, though still keeping its powder dry, its
                        continuance into the third decade of work appears to be taken increasingly
                        for granted by almost all, including France.<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">In

                    <p>Mr. Malve noted that he had recently accompanied Commissioner Deniau on his
                        campaign for election as a Gaullist Deputy and is now about to tour the
                        United States. He was hoping to be able to reach some kind of a “synthesis”
                        from these experiences. He referred to the great value, in his view, of the
                        partnership concept and asked Mr. Rostow to comment on relations between the
                        United States and Europe.</p>
                    <p>Beginning his response with economic problems, Mr. Rostow said that
                        partnership is a reality. We have discovered in the Kennedy Round, the
                        balance of payments adjustment process and other areas that problem
                        solutions require cooperation between the United States and Europe. The
                        discussions since January 1 on the US balance of payments situation have
                        gone very well, with Europe's agreeing to expansion, maintenance of
                        relatively low interest rates, and the acceleration/deceleration proposal,
                        which Mr. Rostow called a major act of solidarity. European capital exports
                        have been greater than anyone expected.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow went on to say that very important things were developing in the
                        scientific field, where the United States is now studying means of
                        cooperating with Europe to maintain the momentum of intergovernmental
                        efforts. He referred to the space mission about to visit Washington, and to
                        the United States proposals on INTELSAT.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Mr. Rostow said it is basic US foreign policy to work with Europe
                        within the concept of partnership.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Malve asked for US views about France and NATO. Mr. Rostow said we were
                        saddened by French withdrawal and missed the French contribution there, but
                        France itself must judge whether withdrawal was an error.</p>
                    <p>In response to another question, Mr. Rostow said France should not devalue.
                        He added that the international monetary system cannot take many more
                        shocks. He said the United States understands the French need to act because
                        of the great impact of the July 1 tariff reductions, and we understand that
                        what France had done were minimal steps. We want to minimize the
                        repercussions, he added.</p>
                    <p>Concerning countervailing duties, Mr. Rostow said that we have explained to
                        France officially that the U.S. law allows no latitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Malve said he was pleased to hear that the United States appreciates the
                        importance of France's accepting the July 1 reductions, which was a great
                        effort on France's part. Mr. Rostow noted that not undertaking the
                        reductions could have been very serious.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow said that the US public's attitude towards France has been hurt by
                        the French action in getting American troops out of France, by rumors about
                        French attacks on the dollar, by the French position on the Middle East and
                        by statements concerning Viet-Nam. DeGaulle is so conspicuous, he added,
                        that people tend to identify him with Europe. Mr. Malve said he regretted
                        the French attitude on Viet-Nam, which he <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0757"/>did not think was appropriate, particularly in view of
                        France's experience there. Mr. Rostow emphasized the basic underlying
                        friendship between the United States and France with the observation that
                        American flags had been seen at the pro-Gaullist demonstrations on the
                        Champs Elysee in May.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked for Mr. Malve's judgment on participation. Mr. Malve
                        answered in terms of students, industry and agriculture. Because the number
                        of college-level students in France has trebled in the last eight years, he
                        said, graduates are no longer certain of having jobs. This has profoundly
                        affected their view of society. Labor/management relations are changing, but
                        have not yet reached a satisfactory state. Agriculture is disaffected by
                        repeated statements that there are too many farmers, that they are
                        inefficient, etc., and by the fact that they are subject to the decisions of
                        “technocrats” in Brussels. There is no dialogue between professors and
                        students in France, Mr. Malve said, and too little of the human element in
                        French education, which is far too centralized. He referred further to the
                        politicization of French society and the shock felt in face of the magnitude
                        of problems of the modern world. On the other hand, the French have an
                        obsessive fear of disorder.</p>

                        persuasive.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Value and Function of NATO.</p>
                    <p>The value of NATO to the United States rests on the basic fact that our vital
                        security is indissolubly tied to the security of Western Europe. The
                        resources, human and material, of Western Europe, if in hostile hands or
                        under the domination of a hostile power, would be enough to tip the balance
                        of world power against us. We would have to become a <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0758"/>bristling defensive fortress, and live
                        under drastically different conditions. Our society would have to be
                        organized for survival against an enormous technological and manpower
                        threat, with a manifold increase in the percentage of our resources spent
                        for defense.</p>
                    <p>The vital importance to the US of keeping Western Europe free is therefore
                        quite clear. Almost as important to our national security is the
                        preservation of the political stability and security of Western Europe. In
                        view of the history of two world wars, and of today's balance of power in
                        Europe, it is very clear that the United States is needed in Europe to
                        preserve the political balance between East and West, and even to permit a
                        secure and easy relationship among our friends in Western Europe. NATO has
                        enabled us to accomplish both the purpose of preserving our vital security
                        interest in Europe, and the purpose of letting Germany contribute to
                        European defense without arousing fear among its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The record of US commitment to NATO—a commitment that would be brought into
                        grave doubt by an abrupt withdrawal of 5/6 of our forces from Europe—has
                        been repeatedly made clear by the Presidents of the US over the past two
                        decades.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, on 19 February 1968, when President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with NATO's Secretary General
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>, they jointly announced
                        that:</p>
                    <p>“They considered the maintenance of NATO's strength, including the U.S.
                        commitment, as necessary to continuing stability and security in the North
                        Atlantic area. This stability and security provides the basis for exploring
                        with the USSR the possibility of mutual force reductions.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. US and European Contributions to NATO.</p>
                    <p>In early 1950s, the United States had to provide the muscle, the forces, the
                        organizing talent, and the resources to get NATO started, and to create a
                        respectable power base. But since then, our European friends have, in fact,
                        steadily built up their forces, the equipment of these forces, and the share
                        of the common load of defense they are carrying. United States forces now
                        constitute only 12% of the ground manpower in NATO Europe, even if French
                        troops are excluded, and about 1/4 of the air force.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. The Need For Strong Conventional Forces in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the most critical region, Central Europe, the Soviets and their allies
                        facing NATO have in excess of 600,000 men. NATO forces in that area
                        presently approximate the same total. It is here that US forces are
                        concentrated. A drastic cut in US forces thus would upset the conventional
                        force balance of the two alliances.</p>
                    <p>For aggression to be deterred, it is essential that NATO not become inferior
                        to the Warsaw Pact in any element of its military establishment. Nuclear
                        weapons, for example, are no substitute for soldiers. Where one <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0759"/>side possesses stronger conventional
                        forces, it may be tempted to exploit that conventional strength recognizing
                        that a nuclear response would be so imprudent as to make its threat
                        incredible. NATO's political weakness resulting from a disparity in
                        conventional forces would thus increase the chances of pressures by the
                        Warsaw Pact, such as, for example, intensification of the incidents
                        involving access to West Berlin. The multiplication of such incidents would
                        create a grave danger that miscalculation might lead to general
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p> NATO's security, and hence our own, requires balanced forces— conventional
                        as well as nuclear. Such balanced forces now exist. We must not abandon
                        them. Although we should continue to seek mutual force reductions with the
                        nations of the Warsaw Pact and should continue to encourage replacement of
                        US forces by those of our European allies, we must follow both courses in a
                        fashion that avoids disturbing the present balance in Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. US Withdrawals From Europe.</p>
                    <p>Past and Current Withdrawals. While our military contributions are still
                        substantial, they have steadily become a smaller share of the total European
                        defense burden. Our troop strength in Europe has steadily diminished as our
                        European allies have taken over more of this burden. In 1961 we had 417,000
                        military personnel in and afloat in the <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> area. In 1966 we had 366,000. In 1967, in removing our
                        forces from France, we eliminated spaces accounting for about 18,000
                        military personnel and 21,000 dependents, and also eliminated 11,000 jobs
                        held by foreign nationals, saving $110 million in BOP costs. We are now
                        engaged in redeploying to the United States, as part of the 24th Division
                        and four air squadron redeployment from Germany (Reforger/Crested Cap),
                        33,000 military personnel, about 15,000 dependents, and 96 fighter aircraft
                        at a prospective saving of about $70 million annually in our balance of
                        payments. Thus by September, 1968, we will have reduced our authorized
                        strength in Europe by a total of 51,000 military personnel and 36,000
                        dependents.</p>
                    <p>These large reductions of US forces in Europe have been kept in phase with
                        the increasing capability of European forces, and with the capacity of the
                        US to return our combat forces in a hurry in a real emergency. They have
                        therefore been within the capacity of NATO Europe to absorb, both militarily
                        and politically.</p>
                    <p>Further US Withdrawals. The Department of Defense is at this moment
                        considering, together with the Department of State, how we can make further
                        sizeable yet orderly reductions in our European troop levels and costs over
                        the next several years. On the 10th of May in Brussels, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> told the NATO Defense
                        Ministers:</p>
                    <p>“While I cannot speak for future Administrations, I do not believe that it is
                        realistic to assume that the United States will maintain the same <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0760"/>level of ready forces deployed in
                        Europe indefinitely into the future. I think it is inevitable that the
                        European members of the Alliance should plan increasingly over the coming
                        years to assume greater responsibility for the direct and immediate defense
                        of Europe.”</p>
                    <p>We have lost no time in starting this process, but we believe it is essential
                        to conduct the process in a way which will preserve the cohesiveness and
                        strength of NATO and which will protect to the maximum US interests in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>We are considering actively a series of proposals which could result in
                        reductions of over 40,000 additional military personnel in Europe, to start
                        in this fiscal year and to be completed during the next, and an annual
                        saving of over $200 million in <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> costs.
                        Our emphasis will be on maintaining combat capability to the maximum extent,
                        cutting drastically into expensive support activities and headquarters
                        rather than into combat troops wherever practicable. These additional
                        military personnel reductions, when added to our reductions since 1 January
                        1966, would yield almost 100,000 military personnel cuts in Europe (18,000
                        from relocations from France, 33,000 from Germany, and over 40,000
                        additional). Taking into account US and foreign employees as well as US
                        dependents, these cumulative reductions are anticipated to yield a total cut
                        in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> supported population in Europe of
                        about 215,000 and <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> savings of over $350
                        million a year.</p>
                    <p>Our proposals regarding this further reduction should be ready in the near
                        future, hopefully within the next month. We must then consult with our NATO
                        allies and consider how we can fit together our planned reductions and their
                        defense planning, making adjustments or tradeoffs to provide for an orderly
                        transition and the maximum possible maintenance of NATO strength in Europe.
                        What we are doing is, therefore, fully in accord with the views often
                        expressed in Congress. We are reducing our level of forces in Europe and
                        encouraging our European allies to provide a greater proportion of NATO
                        forces, while at the same time adhering steadfastly to our obligations under
                        the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Nor is the reduction now under consideration to be the final word. We will
                        continue to diminish US force levels in Europe as rapidly as the political,
                        military, and technological situation allows. If the Soviets respond to
                        current NATO suggestions of mutual force reductions, such response would
                        permit us to accelerate these reductions. But it is vital to our own
                        security, to the political stability of Europe, and to the political and
                        military power balance in the world that the reductions of US forces in
                        Europe are kept in step with the political and military power realities.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. The Balance of Payments Effects of European
                        Deployments.</p>
                    <p>We are keenly aware of the importance of reducing our balance of payments
                        deficit. But the amount of deficit that can be ascribed to our European
                        deployments is frequently exaggerated. The fact is that of the <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0761"/>1.6 billion dollars in current military
                        costs in Europe, something like 1.1 to 1.3 billion is currently offset
                        through cash receipts from arms purchases by our allies and through
                        financial measures, such as bond purchases, which they undertake for the
                        purpose of relieving the US balance of payments deficit on the military
                        account. A drastic reduction in US expenditures in Europe on military
                        account could also result in a substantial reduction of purchases of US
                        military equipment and US securities by our European allies. Thus the small
                        net gap in our balance of payments on military account in Europe could well
                        remain relatively unchanged.</p>
                    <p>Our overall balance of payments deficit, in the area of $3–1/2 billion last
                        year, is a problem of the most serious concern to all of us. But the three
                        to five hundred million dollars current net deficit which results from our
                        European deployments, is a small price to pay for the security it buys for
                        us.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Germany, where by far the greatest number of our forces are
                        stationed, the “gap” is expected to average only approximately $200 million
                        annually during FY 1968 and FY 1969. That gap cannot endanger our gold
                        reserves, moreover, since Germany follows a policy of not converting dollars
                        into gold. Recently we concluded an agreement with the Germans whereby in
                        addition to payments of approximately $100 million for commercial purchases
                        of military equipment, they agreed to purchase $625 million in bonds to
                        reduce the military balance of payments deficit for fiscal year 1969.</p>
                    <p>As to the future, we are exploring exhaustively possible means of further
                        ameliorating the <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> situation, over and
                        above the various force reductions currently being studied. We are examining
                        the possibility that joint basing arrangements can be made; that certain
                        military functions now performed by US forces can be transferred to other
                        NATO countries; and that host countries can assume certain maintenance and
                        operations costs now financed by the US. We have also completed a
                        comprehensive study of US community support for our troops in Europe and
                        have identified other measures which may enable us to realize further <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> economies.</p>
                    <p>The United States and German Governments agreed on 10 June of this year to
                        begin talks in the early fall to explore together possible long-term
                        solutions for the particular <gloss target="#t_BOP1">BOP</gloss> problem on
                        military account in that country.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. The Adverse Effects of Drastic Congressional
                        Action.</p>
                    <p>It is our strong conviction that any Congressional action at this time
                        drastically reducing US force levels in Europe would have the gravest
                        consequences for the security and stability of the NATO Alliance, and <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0762"/>would wreak havoc with US policies
                        and goals in related areas. In particular:</p>
                    <p>The Europeans could not possibly make the requisite military adjustments in
                        time to compensate for the withdrawn US forces. The remaining US forces
                        would not be able to put up any substantial fight for Berlin, to safeguard
                        our nuclear arsenal, or even to receive and deploy reinforcements from the
                        US rapidly in case of trouble in Europe. A large portion of our nuclear
                        weapons, many of which are pledged to the support of European forces which
                        man the delivery systems, might have to be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>The psychological and political effect would be even more destructive than
                        the military effect. Europeans would feel profoundly uneasy about the
                        stability of any American commitment at all, and might well seek safety in
                        neutralism and accommodation with their overwhelming neighbor on the
                        Continent, the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Germans, above all, would feel that the US had in large part decided to
                        abandon them and that the remaining US forces were largely token. The effect
                        on internal German political stability would be strongly adverse.
                        Nationalist influence would grow very rapidly, and a German foreign policy
                        seeking a relationship with the Soviets, offering heavy economic concessions
                        and a possible neutralist stance, would gain wide acceptance. This in turn
                        would revive a host of European antagonisms and anxieties which are now
                        effectively held in check by the assurance of stability that the US presence
                        provides. The other Europeans would view with great unease not only the new
                        military balance in Europe favoring the East, but the disproportionately
                        large German forces involved on the Western side.</p>
                    <p>A massive redeployment of US troops from Europe would require very great
                        one-time budgetary expenditures, and pose personnel, construction,
                        procurement and training problems. Based on a preliminary analysis,
                        withdrawal of 200,000 US military and civilian personnel and their
                        dependents could mean one-time budget costs of over three billion dollars if
                        equipment were procured and prepositioned overseas to permit rapid return of
                        these forces to Europe in case of need. The cost could be about $1–1/2
                        billion if the redeployed units did not have prepositioned equipment in
                        Europe. It is also very important to understand that redeployment of forces
                        from Europe to <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> does not save major
                        recurring budgetary costs, since most of the costs of supporting
                        forces—equipment, personnel, and most operating costs—are the same whether
                        the forces are located here or in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Such action would also affect the prospects for ratification of the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty. We would be undermining our Allies' confidence in
                        US mutual defense assurances at the very time that many NATO countries, and
                        especially the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, are seeking
                        reaffirmation of US commitments <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0763"/>to
                        facilitate their undertaking a 25-year <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        obligation, in the face of the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty could be
                        terminated at a year's notice.</p>
                    <p>In Eastern Europe, the Czechs have recently made some determined steps toward
                        greater independence from the Soviets. The USSR and other Eastern European
                        countries are applying diplomatic and even some military pressures on the
                        moderate Communist government in Prague. Massive withdrawal of US troops,
                        leaving the field largely to the Soviet Union and its adherents, would
                        discourage this and other efforts toward liberalization and would strengthen
                        the advocates of hard-line Communist hostility and repression.</p>
                    <p>It is barely a year since the US and NATO completed their relocation of
                        troops and headquarters from France. While the Fourteen (the NATO nations
                        other than France) have adjusted well to the new situation, and while NATO
                        maintains peacetime cooperation with the French and would hope to have
                        French support in wartime, the partial disengagement of France from NATO
                        military affairs has not been without an undesirable adverse political
                        effect. A drastic US redeployment would aggravate this effect substantially
                        and suggest a weakening in the political cohesion of Western Europe as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>In the Mediterranean, Soviet fleet activities have markedly increased.
                        Although we now consider the Soviet threat in the Med to be essentially
                        political rather than military, the shadow of the increased Soviet presence
                        would grow substantially longer if the US withdrew the bulk of its forces
                        from Europe. The impact on Turkey would be immediate and damaging.</p>
                    <p> NATO cannot continue as a viable organization unless we consult with our
                        Allies well in advance about any proposed change in our force contribution
                        to NATO which will have profound effects on their security and political
                        posture. Drastic Congressional action to take the bulk of our forces out of
                        Europe would confront our Allies with a fait accompli. It would make a
                        mockery of our efforts at genuine consultation in the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>A legislative directive to cut our current European forces from about 340,000
                        to 50,000 would be an action destructive of our own security posture, and of
                        the military balance of Europe, and surely of the political stability of the
                        continent. It would be regarded by friend, ally, neutral, and foe as the
                        substantial abandonment of Europe by the US, as a loss of our interest in
                        the continent in view of our Asian engagement, as a return to isolation, and
                        as an act that would cast doubt on the validity of our international
                        commitments.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> began by saying the US and
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> are headed for a collision on the
                        Common Agricultural Policy. We recognize that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> needs a <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>, but the
                        protection level and subsidies are too high. <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> subsidies for exports to third markets, such as those for
                        lard and barley, are especially serious for us. Our farm community views
                        them as an attack by the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> on our foreign
                        markets. We will have to do something or our liberal trade policies now
                        being threatened by protectionists will lose the support of
                        agriculture—politically the most powerful group in favor of liberal trade.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> asked Malve if something
                        cannot be done about the subsidy problem.</p>
                    <p> Malve said the US had missed an opportunity in not negotiating with the
                        Community on the latter's <gloss target="#t_MDS1">MDS</gloss> proposals in
                        the KR since binding of the <gloss target="#t_MDS1">MDS</gloss> would have
                        set a limit to export subsidies and to internal <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> prices. This proposal represented an enormous step for the
                        Community. Today European farmers will not hear of any limitation on export
                        subsidies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> replied the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> had insisted on too large a
                        differential between Community prices and world prices. Mr. Malve agreed the
                        margin of support demanded by the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> had been
                        too large but said it had been very difficult to make it smaller since the
                        proportion of the Community population which gets its living from
                        agriculture is still about 20% of the total, hence a major political
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Malve said that for the present a new round of generalized negotiations
                        is not feasible. A long-term solution will be provided only <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0765"/>by the Community acting unilaterally. In
                        the meantime bilateral talks might be helpful in avoiding a US/<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> conflict over subsidies. Eventually the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> would have to find the courage to
                        overhaul the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> which, it is already widely
                        realized, is not the best policy. Other countries obviously cannot accept a
                        situation in which the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> restricts access to
                        its own markets and at the same time expands exports by means of subsidies.
                        In the absence of an authority which could arbitrate differences, the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> was pieced together by simply adding the
                        extreme demands of each of the Six. Price levels were thus set for the needs
                        of marginal producers with the result that the costs of the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> are too high and efficient producers (e.g.
                        of wheat) are, in Malve's view, getting rich. An overhaul of the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> should start with a division of Community
                        agriculture into three categories—production that is competitive, production
                        that could be competitive if given some assistance, and production that
                        should be abandoned (i.e., all production in a few regions, certain products
                        in certain regions). But before such an overhaul of the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> can be undertaken, the Community must first
                        have a higher degree of integration—specifically, common policies are
                        necessary in the fields of education, social welfare, industry, and regional
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> noted this is a long run
                        solution. What can be done in the short run? It is loss of our established
                        markets in third countries that causes us the greatest political problems.
                        Can the EC reduce subsidy payments without reducing gate prices? Mr. Malve
                        answered that it would be very difficult for the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to reduce subsidies. Given the strong feelings of European
                        farmers and the political power they wield, the most the Community could do
                        would be to make adjustments for individual products when this will not
                        attract too much attention. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> said this situation left us no choice but to
                        subsidize our own exports. We cannot allow ourselves to be deprived of
                        established markets in third countries by subsidized Community exports. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> reminded Malve that the
                        US can doubtless afford to spend more on subsidies than the Community. The
                        Administration has been reluctant to subsidize but Congress is in favor of
                        doing so, and perhaps US subsidies would give Communities the “courage” to
                        improve the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p> Malve agreed the situation was unfortunate. Speaking personally, he wondered
                        whether the Community should not now move toward country quotas for
                        suppliers, something formerly thought incompatible with the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p> Malve said our Mission in Brussels was active, and by its constant pressure
                        on the Commission had prevented the Community from adopting some measures we
                        would have found even more objectionable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> mentioned his visit to
                        Brussels the following week to discuss preferences with Commission Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>, and wished Malve an
                        interesting and profitable visit in the US.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President, after an exchange of courtesies, expressed his satisfaction at
                        the good relations between the United States and the Federal Republic and
                        thanked the Minister specifically for the cooperation of the German
                        Government in international monetary matters.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> congratulated the
                        President on obtaining a tax increase from Congress. He said that this
                        represented a kind of psychological turning point which had contributed
                        greatly to get many other matters settled in the financial field. He said he
                        knew just how hard it must have been for the President to get this bill
                        passed as he had had to increase taxes himself when he took office eighteen
                        months ago.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow interjected that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> had remarked to him during their conversation on the
                        occasion of the <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> funeral that
                        he found himself in a very uncomfortable position. Not only did he have to
                        increase taxes but to lower veterans' and welfare benefits at the same
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that there may be fields in which the Americans are
                        the equal of the Germans and there may be fields where the Americans were
                        better than the Germans, but the fiscal was certainly not one of them. He
                        had always believed that whenever a situation arose that tended to separate
                        the boys from the men the Germans could be found on the proper side and this
                        had been true of fiscal matters.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said West Germany had
                        been fortunate to have enjoyed 18 years of prosperity after the currency
                        reform. Their first serious recession had come in 1966 and it had been a
                        good thing that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0767"/>was able to overcome it fairly
                        quickly as both Britain and France had suffered economic setbacks recently
                        which would have led to a much worse crisis if Germany had still been near
                        the bottom of its recession. These incidents pointed out the need for
                        greater cooperation among the European countries. Maybe in four or five
                        years or so the British and French may have to bail out the Federal
                        Republic.</p>
                    <p>The President stated he was hoping and praying for a united Europe. Until
                        this could become a reality, it was essential that the United States and
                        Germany work together closely in every field, and he was sure this would be
                        the case.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied that the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> after the war had been provided
                        economic security through the Marshall Plan and military security through
                        the Alliance. Nobody appreciated this more than the Germans. However,
                        Europeans today showed a greater and greater tendency to enjoy life in the
                        shadow of the greater world conflicts, removed from exercising
                        responsibility on world politics. They were content to let the United States
                        do the job. On top of that, many raised their voices in criticism of the
                        actions of the United States. It was extremely important to bring Europe
                        back to a greater sense of responsibility and engagement.</p>
                    <p>The President nodded agreement and said, “the whole world must be brought to
                        exercising greater responsibility.”</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he was often
                        described as the “gang leader” of the Gaullists in Germany. He believed that
                        in many ways <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was pursuing
                        the right goals. He disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, however, on two points:</p>
                    <p>1. He believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was wrong in
                        flirting with Moscow as, for one thing, the Soviets would never regard him
                        as their match. France was too small.</p>
                    <p>2. He also believed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        “constant resentful anti-American tune” was lamentable.</p>
                    <p>It was not necessary to be anti-American in order to gain greater
                        independence for Europe as the United States was not opposed to a more
                        independent Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that the United States indeed favored a more independent
                        Europe. He would not do anything that could promote such anti-American
                        sentiments and he had always turned the other cheek when confronted with
                        such statements. When the French found themselves in trouble, he was among
                        the first to hold out a helping hand.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he believed that
                        this course pursued by the President was an extremely wise one.</p>
                    <p>The President added that in extending a hand to France he had not only been
                        guided by compassion and good statesmanship but that he had tried to act in
                        the interest of the entire world and, also, because he <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0768"/>could envision a situation in which France
                        could be much worse off than under <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stated the present
                        measures would not go far to cure the basic ills of France's social
                        structure. France was lagging far behind its partners in industrial
                        relations and the living standard accorded the working class. Minimum wages
                        for construction workers were under $100 a month while prices were 50%
                        higher than in the Federal Republic. With such conditions, nobody should
                        have been surprised by the recent events in France.</p>
                    <p>The President described to the Minister the plans for setting up a public
                        affairs school in Austin, Texas, with the aim of taking outstanding students
                        with BA's who had political interests and giving them the very best possible
                        education in public affairs. He was trying to attract the very best of
                        teachers and public figures to take part in this project. He, himself,
                        having had only a limited education, was acutely aware of the benefits such
                        an institution could render to aspiring political leaders. He would very
                        much want to invite the Minister to come down sometime after the opening of
                        the school next September for a few days of lectures and conversations with
                        the students.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed his
                        gratitude for the invitation and said he would be absolutely delighted to
                        accept it. He said, moreover, that he found this to be a fascinating idea
                        which the Germans should also take up as, if anything, they had an even
                        greater need for well-trained and well-informed political talent.</p>
                    <p>The President then described to the Minister the reasons that had influenced
                        him not to run again for election, and pointed out that the major
                        legislation he had been able to get through Congress recently would not have
                        been possible if he had had to give undue weight to the political factors
                        involved in running for office.</p>
                    <p>He thanked Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> again for
                        the good cooperation on fiscal matters and said he believed that this area
                        was now in reasonably good shape. He hoped he would be able to rely on
                        German cooperation also in the future.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he had had
                        fruitful talks with Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and that there were no misunderstandings on financial
                        problems separating the two. He recognized the great importance of the
                        offset issue in keeping American troops in Europe and was ready to start
                        negotiations on the long-term offset solution this fall.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized the great importance of such a long-term solution.
                        He thanked the Minister for his visit and said he hoped to see him soon in
                        Texas.</p>

                    <p>4381. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> views on post-Czech
                        reassessments.</p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> and I had a general tour
                        d'horizon today on the implications for NATO of developments in Eastern
                        Europe. We agreed that while any NATO decisions would have to await outcome
                        of current discussions in Moscow, it was probably true that the implications
                        for NATO will be drawn primarily from events to date, i.e., the raw fact of
                        the invasion itself. That is, the Soviets have demonstrated both a
                        willingness to use force for political purposes and a capacity for political
                        misjudgments and mismanagement which contrasts with the military
                        effectiveness of their operation; this creates impression that political
                        constraints on Soviet behavior are less than had sometimes been assumed.</p>
                    <p>2. On <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> idea for a high-level
                        meeting, we compared impressions that Germans were not taking any follow-up
                        initiative on the subject here. I did raise on a personal basis the question
                        of whether there might be a place in the fall scenario for a <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> meeting at <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> level, i.e., taking advantage of the fact that most key
                        Ministers, including ours, would already be in Bonn for the NPG meeting on
                        10 October. Having an immediately preceding or following meeting of the
                            <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> in Bonn might be a politically
                        useful step if relevant decisions could be made ready by then. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> thought the idea interesting but
                        wished to reflect further.</p>
                    <p>3. We also noted that the Military Committee was today discussing the notion
                        of a collective no-reduction pledge (the text of MCM 68–68, 26 Aug 1968, is
                        reported and discussed in septel).<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">Not further
                            identified.</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> felt this notion (that there
                        should be no weakening of NATO pending a defense review of the new
                        situation) was a good one and especially helpful vis-a-vis the Belgians.
                        Comment: We are not clear enough here as to the state of play of various
                        possible U.S. adjustments in the light of the Czech situation to assess what
                        problems, if any, this would pose for us. But on the available evidence, it
                        appears almost certain that such a “freeze” would be strongly favored by the
                        British— or, at least, by Healey—and by both the Germans and Italians. The
                        Dutch, Norwegians and all others would also be favorable, so that there
                        would be, in effect, unanimity if the Belgians <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0770"/>and the Canadians (and, of course, the U.S.) found it
                        palatable. See septel for our recommendation. End comment.</p>
                    <p>4. In our discussion of a “defense review”, we identified three separate
                        elements:</p>
                    <p>A. The package of problems dealing with warning, surprise, crisis management
                        and consultation—which the Germans and Dutch will certainly want to
                        review;</p>
                    <p>B. The question of force levels and particularly qualitative factors and
                        remediable deficiencies—which might initially be approached by way of a
                        freeze on reductions and then improvements in the 1969–73 force plans which
                        will be up for review in December;</p>
                    <p>C. The continental mobilization—US-UK-Canadian reinforcement package, i.e.,
                        the “you mobilize—we'll reinforce” bargain suggested by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s remarks at the last <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> felt that this might be the area in which the German
                        proposal for a restatement of the NATO defense concept could find a
                        productive application this fall.</p>
                    <p>5. Turning to the political side, our discussion also brought out the need
                        for a parallel reappraisal (“Harmel revisited”). This, in contrast to the
                        fourteen-nation defense review, in the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>,
                        would be handled in fifteen-nation <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>s. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>'s instinctive feeling at this point is quite similar
                        to our own, namely, that while the importance of the “defense” pillar has
                        been heightened, the “detente” pillar remains valid, even though the process
                        will be longer and harder than we had thought. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> was concerned that questions
                        might be raised about the status of ongoing work for the longer-term on
                        East-West relations and <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>. He thought
                        while we could anticipate increased resistance to <gloss target="#t_MFR1">MFR</gloss>, it was still relevant to continue our homework, even if in
                        somewhat lower key and over longer period.</p>
                    <p>6. In the next day or two, <gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> will be
                        sending its further analysis of the substance of these defense and political
                        reviews and how they should be related to each other, along with our ideas
                        for a fall scenario. This package will be raw material for my consultations
                        in Washington next week.</p>
                    <p>7. One substantive comment seems in order now: it is important to distinguish
                        the question of posture and actions in direct response to the Czech
                        situation on which, despite occasional sniping, there has been no
                        responsible suggestion that NATO should have taken other than a “low
                        profile” posture, from a kind of “malaise” which may adversely affect some
                        elements of NATO's new strategic concept. Some Europeans are “discovering”
                        that despite all the talk—especially from the U.S.—in recent years about
                        crisis management, flexibility, mobility, mobilization, political waring,
                        etc., the more likely kind of crisis is one like the present, i.e., internal
                        to Eastern Europe, which makes it politically impossible for NATO to
                        implement those concepts for fear of being provocative. Thus, the concepts
                        themselves have tended to come under attack; and while we think there are
                        some good rebuttals, e.g., on warning time (see <gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss>
                        <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0771"/>4364),<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">Telegram 4364, August 24, summarized the discussion at a North Atlantic
                            Council meeting on August 23 during which the question of the time for a
                            political warning was discussed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            DEF 1 NATO)</note> the critics may have one valid point. Perhaps the
                        most likely contingency directly threatening NATO would be a follow-on to
                        tension within the bloc, i.e., where the Pact subsequently decided to whip
                        up a crisis with NATO to obscure or bridge over an internal crisis. Here
                        NATO might not be politically in a position to take full advantage of
                        warning time and mobility, giving the Warsaw Pact—as things stand just now—a
                        significant head start in operational readiness. This aspect can doubtless
                        be explored in the defense review, with a possibility that future exercise
                        (such as one involving the U.S. redeployed forces, and some selective
                        mobilization or reserve activation) could be arranged against a scenario of
                        the need for “non-provocative” readiness measures in an assumed high state
                        of tension within the Warsaw Pact. But to avoid the malaise getting too much
                        headway, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, it would seem worthwhile
                        to us to try to work out some such international activity, even of a limited
                        nature, in the near term.<note n="4" xml:id="d321fn4">After summarizing the

                    <p>The principal aims of the draft Presidential messages are (a) to summarize
                        briefly the main conclusions the US has drawn from the Czech crisis for
                        Western and NATO interests; and (b) to propose a special meeting of NATO
                        Foreign and Defense Ministers for the week of September 22, 1968.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the crisis a number of major issues will have to be reexamined
                        intensively by the Allies. The Permanent Council and the NATO military
                        authorities are already discussing some of them. Taking account of initial
                        Allied reactions to the crisis, we believe the following matters might be
                        indicated for Ministerial action at the September meeting:</p>
                    <p>1. We might aim at an interim freeze on NATO forces and lay the groundwork
                        for establishing a floor under force levels for the longer term. We would,
                        moreover, seek a demonstration of the Europeans' willingness to make
                        increased efforts for their own defense.</p>
                    <p>2. Defense Ministers might give guidance for improving reserves, equipment
                        and mobilization capabilities. We may wish to announce plans for exercises
                        involving the return to Europe of our redeployed forces.</p>
                    <p>3. Ministers might give necessary directives on strategic questions. Our aim
                        would be to seek Allied reaffirmation of the validity of the flexible
                        response concept but with agreement to reexamine the doctrine of political
                        warning time.</p>
                    <p>4. Closely related to the foregoing, Ministers could direct that the current
                        study of NATO-Warsaw Pact capabilities be accelerated and completed in time
                        for Ministerial consideration in December.</p>
                    <p>5. With regard to the Mediterranean, Ministers might direct the immediate
                        activation of COMARAIRMED, the new command which is to coordinate aerial
                        surveillance of the Soviet fleet.</p>
                    <p>6. On the political side, we may wish to seek agreement on a special
                        declaration in which the member governments could reemphasize their support
                        for the Alliance and the NATO security system in the wake of the Czech
                        crisis. Such a declaration could also deal with the continuity in
                        longer-term objectives for improving East-West relations.</p>
                    <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0773"/>
                    <p>7. In the declaration, or in the regular communique, we might also wish to
                        make clear that the mutual force reduction proposal remains on the table for
                        the longer term.</p>
                    <p>8. The most important Alliance political issue we may need to deal with, at
                        least in preliminary fashion, is the Italian suggestion that member
                        governments strengthen the Treaty by formal action to make clear their
                        intent to refrain from exercising the withdrawal right for an additional
                        period of years beyond 1969. While this subject may not be ready for
                        discussion at the Ministerial session, we should give it serious internal
                        consideration in any case. Greater assurance about the Alliance's future
                        would have a favorable impact (a) on overall aspects of US-European
                        relations, and (b) on various specific issues, notably the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We must of course be prepared for difficulties with the French over at least
                        some aspects of the Ministerial Meeting. It may be necessary, for example,
                        to divide the meeting into two sessions with the Fourteen (<gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>) first taking up military questions and the
                        Fifteen (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>) subsequently considering
                        political questions.</p>
                    <p>In our view, the advantages of an early Ministerial Meeting would clearly
                        outweigh any difficulties. The invasion of Czechoslovakia has shocked
                        European opinion to the point of creating a new, positive atmos-phere for
                        NATO and for US leadership in tackling Alliance problems. We should take
                        advantage of this atmosphere while it is so favorable.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">On August 30, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> cabled his general agreement with <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>'s recommendations, but suggested the

                    <p rend="center">I. Introduction</p>
                    <p>The Czechoslovak crisis has raised grave issues for the United States and its
                        Western European allies. It has cast into question such matters as the
                        future of detente, the defensive capability of Western Europe, and the
                        future of Communism and the independent states of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the issues and the current and
                        prospective means for meeting these problems by the United States and its
                        allies.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. detente</p>
                    <p>The August 20–21 occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact provided a
                        cold douche for the future of detente, or the progressive rapprochement of
                        East and West. In the late Sixties, the achievement of detente had become an
                        important objective in the policies of most Western European nations as well
                        as the United States. It had become a key element in the work program of the
                        North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But its assumed basis was seriously
                        undermined by the Czechoslovak crisis.</p>
                    <p>Most Western nations have reacted with strong expressions of disgust at, and
                        disapproval of, the Warsaw Pact occupation of independent Czechoslovakia.
                        There was almost universal support for the United Nations consideration of
                        this problem and approbation for the resolution supported by the majority in
                        the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>To give further meaning to their disapproval, most Western nations undertook
                        to limit contacts with the Soviets and the occupying powers of the Warsaw
                        Pact, and cancelled plans or proposed visits in the political and cultural
                        fields. As the repression of Czechoslovakia continues, with the possibility
                        of the installation of a de facto occupation regime, the deterioration of
                        East-West contacts may well continue.</p>
                    <p>These relatively limited actions do not necessarily preclude the possibility
                        of return in due course to the pursuit of detente. The present disposition
                            <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0775"/>of many European nations is to
                        avoid actions which might impair the eventual resumption of closer relations
                        with the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe. The positions of
                        the United Kingdom and the Government of France on this score are
                        particularly apparent.</p>
                    <p> US actions have so far generally paralleled those of its Western European
                        allies. For the time being we are seeking a balanced approach that will
                        satisfy the immediate objective of expressing censure of Soviet action
                        without destroying overnight our longer-range goals.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow 9 paragraphs on actions to be taken in the cultural field.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. The Defense of Western Europe</p>
                    <p>The movement of Warsaw Pact forces into Czechoslovakia and the continuing
                        occupation of that country has obviously affected the military situation in
                        Europe. The status quo has been changed. There are larger military forces
                        present in Central Europe than at any time since the post-war period. The
                        military occupation of Czechoslovakia puts Soviet forces in a country where
                        they have not been since World War II. There is no assurance as yet that the
                        Warsaw Pact forces will soon return to their deployment where they existed
                        six weeks ago.</p>
                    <p>The changed East-West military situation in Europe is of significance to the
                        security of the United States and its allies. In the light of these
                        developments we are reviewing with our allies what the implications may be
                        for existing arrangements to provide for our common security.</p>
                    <p>The principal forum for this review will be NATO. Since the onset of the
                        Czech crisis, the NATO posture has combined three essential elements: (a)
                        vigilance by the NATO political and military authorities; (b) a low public
                        profile while the spotlight was on the United Nations; and (c) intensified
                        consultations among the Allies regarding implications of the situation for
                        Western security interests.</p>
                    <p>As a result of NATO consultations a number of issues require consideration.
                        These are outlined below.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Proposals for high-level NATO meetings</p>
                    <p>Following a period of speculation and trial balloons—including <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s public mention of a Heads of
                        Government meeting—the British on August 30 took the initiative. They have
                        sought our views on two alternative proposals. Both take account of the fact
                        that Defense Ministers of seven NATO countries are already scheduled to meet
                        in Bonn, October 10–11, as the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG).</p>
                    <p>The first alternative envisages postponing the NPG until the end of October
                        or early November, advancing the date of the usual year-end NATO meeting to
                        the end of October or early November, and holding <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0776"/>both sessions in Brussels. The result would
                        be a stock-taking meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers to consider
                        defense and political matters arising from the crisis. Like the normal
                        December meeting, fourteen countries would meet to examine defense issues
                        while the French would join them later to examine political problems. In the
                        course of the three (or four) day session, the seven-nation NPG would meet
                        for a day.</p>
                    <p>The second alternative involves simply broadening the presently scheduled
                        (October) NPG meeting to include all Defense Ministers (except presumably
                        the French). The British favor the first alternative on political,
                        psychological and practical grounds. It would permit a maximum amount of
                        business to be transacted and avoid a “nuclear affairs” meeting as NATO's
                        first major response to the Czech crisis.</p>
                    <p>A key question, in either case, is whether the necessary groundwork can be
                        laid in time to permit Ministers to take substantive decisions. A meeting
                        without concrete results could be disappointing for NATO as an organization
                        and for public opinion.</p>
                    <p>Another possible course would be to hold a special meeting of Foreign and
                        Defense Ministers towards the end of September to issue a new program of
                        work for NATO. The usual year-end meeting would be held in December. A
                        September meeting would have the advantage of an early public response by
                        NATO to the crisis.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. General Alliance policy on East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>In connection with any special meeting, Ministers would have to decide
                        whether the Czech crisis—and Soviet and Warsaw Pact policies demonstrated by
                        recent events—call for any changes in Alliance policy objectives as stated
                        in the Harmel Report (on future tasks of the Alliance), the Reykjavik
                        declaration on mutual force reductions, or other public pronouncements (such
                        as on strategic concept) issued by NATO over the past two years.</p>
                    <p>Our aim, and presumably that of all Member Governments (with France a
                        possible exception) would be to seek a strong public reaffirmation of the
                        Alliance—its defense and deterrent role—while maintaining the long-range
                        commitment to improved East-West relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Strengthening NATO by extending the North Atlantic
                        Treaty</p>
                    <p>Italy has suggested—although not yet by formal proposal—that Member
                        Governments consider strengthening the Treaty by formal action to ascertain
                        extended life for NATO. Such action would make clear the Allies intent to
                        refrain from exercising the right of withdrawal for an additional period of
                        years (say, ten) beyond 1969. (Article 13 provides that, after the Treaty
                        has been in force for twenty years, a signatory state can withdraw on one
                        year's notice.)</p>
                    <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0777"/>
                    <p>The Allied Governments could act on this problem either by amending the
                        Treaty or <hi rend="italic">issuing individual declarations</hi> of intent
                        to refrain from exercising the withdrawal right for, say, ten more
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Greater assurance about the Alliance's future would have favorable impact on
                        (a) overall US-European relations and (b) specific issues, including the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>This subject may arise in preliminary fashion, at least in the corridors, at
                        any special NATO meeting held in the near future. Our current position is
                        that the Alliance will continue and need not be subject to formal action.
                        The Czechoslovak crisis raises issue of need for a more formal
                        commitment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. NATO force levels and planning</p>
                    <p> NATO is presently considering an urgent Military Committee proposal that
                        member governments defer any further force reductions or redeployments
                        pending NATO review of the overall situation. This proposal gives the United
                        States difficulty because of the current examination of further economies in
                        our defense establishment in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this immediate question, NATO must now reexamine its entire force
                        posture and dispositions in Europe in light of such factors as what the
                        invasion of Czechoslovakia showed about Soviet and Warsaw Pact operations
                        and capabilities, and the fact that Soviet forces will probably be stationed
                        on Czechoslovakia's western frontier for an indefinite period.</p>
                    <p>Apart from other US objectives that may emerge as a result of study, we will
                        want to seek increased European contributions to their own defense. This
                        could include improvement of reserves, equipment, and mobilization
                        capabilities as well as any changes in standing forces.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. NATO strategy, crisis and alert procedures</p>
                    <p> NATO's present strategic concept based on “flexible response” and “forward
                        defense” is unlikely to be altered fundamentally as a result of the Czech
                        crisis. But certain aspects, notably the <hi rend="italic">doctrine of
                            political warning time</hi>, will have to be reexamined. The doctrine
                        envisages that, prior to any overt Warsaw Pact action against NATO, there
                        would be a period of heightened tension and warning permitting the Allies to
                        take necessary reinforcement measures.</p>
                    <p>Closely related to the foregoing, some at least of the Allies will want
                        reexamination of the reinforcement times, strategic mobility for redeploying
                        US forces in Europe, NATO alert and crisis procedures, and the efficiency of
                        the early warning radar system covering the Central Front.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">F. The Mediterranean</p>
                    <p>While the Czech crisis has focussed attention on the NATO Central Front,
                        concern about Soviet pressures against Romania and Yugoslavia <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0778"/>raises anew the problem of Mediterranean
                        security. At the June meeting in Reykjavik NATO Ministers gave various
                        directives aimed at improving command arrangements, stand-by naval force
                        dispositions, and surveillance activities. These were directed primarily at
                        the increased Soviet naval presence in the Mediterranean. Recent events may
                        require review and/or speeding up of NATO work on security in the
                        Mediterranean and on NATO's southeastern flank.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">G. The French attitude</p>
                    <p>On all of the foregoing subjects, the French are in a special position for
                        two reasons. First, they do not participate in most aspects of the
                        integrated military system. Second, since the invasion of Czechoslovak,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has reaffirmed his
                        policy of opposition to “blocs”. As a corollary, the French have been
                        negative on the idea of special high-level western meetings—NATO, <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, or European Community.</p>
                    <p>In all probability, the French would, however, be represented at any
                        Ministerial session of the North Atlantic Council. They would expect the
                        Fourteen to meet without them for part of the session to deal with NATO
                        military questions. The best hope for improving French cooperation in
                        Eastern defense would probably be through practical steps—improved liaison
                        with the NATO military or improvement of French forces in Germany. The
                        Germans are probably in the best position to sound out the French on these
                        questions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">H. The key role of Germany</p>
                    <p>The Federal Republic of Germany—on the Central Front with the largest land
                        army of the continental allies—has been particularly hard hit by the
                        Czechoslovak crisis. The actions of the Warsaw Pact aggressor states have
                        thrown into question the German policy of seeking better relations with the
                        countries of Eastern Europe. Moreover, the rapidity with which the Soviet
                        Union, with little apparent warning, undertook this action, has shaken
                        German confidence in the warning time principle of the NATO strategic
                        concept. </p>
                    <p>The Soviet actions have also caused a reexamination of the German attitude
                        towards signature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>). While no public decision has been made on this subject
                        the issue is obviously one now being subjected to re-appraisal. The Germans
                        feel that to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—with its
                        duration—might well jeopardize their future security.</p>
                    <p>The German press is heavy with charges of “super power complicity” in the
                        Czechoslovak crisis and expressions of uneasy doubts of the ability of the
                        US and other of Germany's allies to stand up to the Warsaw Pact. In
                        addition, there is the problem of Berlin. The actions of the Warsaw Pact
                        aggressor states, following upon the June actions of East Germany against
                        Berlin, raise doubts in German minds about the future of that city which
                        they regard as an important part of Free Germany.</p>
                    <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0779"/>
                    <p>The result is a general malaise through Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> reacted to this feeling in his recent interview
                        when he urged a NATO summit meeting as a means of putting new life in
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>Germany is key to the security of Europe and to the effective functioning of
                        the NATO Alliance. While the current malaise may be founded on emotionalism
                        rather than fact, it remains true that Germany is uneasy and disturbed. Such
                        an attitude can have a multiplier effect throughout Europe unless steps are
                        taken now to reaffirm the solidity and efficacy of Western defense within
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>In short, high-level review and reappraisal by NATO nations could well be an
                        important ingredient in calming the German attitude. It could also be an
                        important factor in the continuance of constructive US/German relations.</p>

                    <p>The President: The purpose of the meeting is to assess the impact of the
                        Czechoslovakian crisis, to discuss how we can use the crisis to strengthen
                        Western European defense and NATO, and to talk about our relations with the
                        Russians and Eastern Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will summarize the
                        issues and possible ways of dealing with them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> will talk about the defense of
                        Western Europe and the new disposition of Soviet troops in Central
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Director Helms and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will
                        give us their views on the German reaction to the crisis. The press has
                        already printed that the State Department was recommending additional
                        reassurances to the Germans even before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had made any recommendation to the President.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> will speak on the

                        we should have done. This is what happened following an indirect mention of

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: The effect of the
                        Soviet action on the policy of detente has been serious. NATO members must
                        consult with each other and be seen consulting. High level NATO meetings
                        will be necessary. As to the future of NATO, it may be necessary to extend
                        now the life of the treaty beyond 1969. The problem is what can we do to
                        reassure NATO members that the treaty will not disappear in 1969 which does
                        not require Senate approval and does not commit the new President.</p>
                    <p>The President: We must not forget that a large number of Senators not long
                        ago favored a substantial immediate reduction of the level of U.S. forces
                        deployed in Europe. Some wanted to reduce this number to 50,000.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: The country will now
                        have to debate again the amount of its resources which it is willing to
                        commit to keeping peace in the world. There is some isolationism in the
                        United States. As NATO was warned at its last meeting held in Iceland, fears
                        of the Soviet leaders as they face a changing world create a dangerous
                        attitude in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow 5 paragraphs on the Czech crisis.]</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>: The Czech
                        invasion was considered in Europe as a momentous event. Soviet troop
                        deployments raised basic questions for NATO members. Shivers went through
                        Europe when it became clear that a successful military operation was
                        launched with such sloppy political preparations. Some European NATO members
                        concluded that the Soviet invasion has upset the warning theory on which
                        they had been relying, i.e., that strategic warning would come far enough in
                        advance to allow the NATO countries to prepare for a military response.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0781"/> NATO agreed to lie low during the
                        time the Czech case was before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They
                        now have issued a statement. (Copy attached) They have agreed to assess the
                        implications of the Czech invasion for allied defense policy, particularly
                        force postures. (Tab C)<note n="4" xml:id="d324fn4">None of the tabs is
                            printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In recent years NATO had followed a two-pillar policy. One pillar was the
                        defense of Western Europe and the other was detente, including the concept
                        of a mutual reduction of NATO-Warsaw Pact forces. The detente pillar had
                        made it possible for liberal political groups in Western Europe to support
                        NATO.</p>
                    <p>There is uncertainty about what NATO now does. There is already an approved
                        policy on not getting chummy with aggressors. There are proposals to hold a
                        high-level meeting consisting of foreign ministers plus defense ministers.
                        Some members favor a review of NATO strategy. Another proposal is to find a
                        way, without amending the treaty, to give members assurance that NATO's life
                        will go beyond the treaty date of 1969.</p>
                    <p>Despite the Czech crisis, Europeans still favor talks with the Soviet Union
                        on major world problems. Some Europeans think that US–USSR relations grow
                        out of shared “atomic complicity” and the Yalta Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>: There are two views
                        as to whether the deployment of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia has
                        increased the threat to NATO. One view holds that the actual threat against
                        European NATO members is actually less than before the Czech crisis, in part
                        because Soviet divisions are farther away and in part because Romanian and
                        Czech troops are no longer available to the Warsaw Pact powers. Therefore
                        the total number of troops available to fight NATO has decreased.</p>
                    <p>The other view is that the threat has increased because Soviet and Pact
                        forces are on a higher readiness level. This readiness level, plus the
                        partial mobilization which was necessary prior to the Czech invasion, along
                        with the possibility that the loyalty of Czech and Romanian troops can be
                        regained, produces a force more powerful than before the crisis.</p>
                    <p>We must use the crisis to prompt NATO states to improve the quality of their
                        troops and to improve their mobilization potential. We should push hard on
                        the Germans to increase their defense budget. On offsets and other balance
                        of payment problems, we should request more from NATO members.</p>
                    <p>We do not know whether there is any possibility of the French rejoining the
                        NATO military effort.</p>
                    <p> NATO members should react by promptly calling a meeting of the Foreign
                        Ministers, Defense Ministers and Chiefs of Staff to discuss the <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0782"/>Warsaw Pact threat to Western Europe. The
                        meeting should be held as early as September 20, even though little comes
                        out of it, because there would be little value in a meeting later. A general
                        communique at the end of the meeting would produce the desired result.</p>
                    <p>We must use this opportunity to find out if our allies are really serious
                        about carrying their fair share of the cost of the defense of Western
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Domestically, the crisis has ended the threat of passage by the Senate of the
                        Symington Amendment. Senator Mansfield no longer is urging a major reduction
                        in the level of U.S. forces in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>: Director Helms should
                        call together an interdepartmental group to write a coordinated estimate of
                        the change in the threat to NATO brought about by the Soviet action against
                        Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>If there is a high-level NATO meeting, the first day should consist only of
                        statements by each NATO member as to what each is doing in response to the
                        Soviet action. Only then would members be allowed to say what others should
                        be doing. We would need to be in a position to say that we would not
                        withdraw additional U.S. forces without consultation and that the force
                        rotation exercise scheduled for the end of this year would be announced
                        now.</p>
                    <p>The President: There hasn't been any shortage of NATO meetings. There should
                        not be a hurry-up meeting. Our critics could accuse us of rushing ahead of
                        other NATO members in the defense of Western Europe. We should be fully
                        prepared before we go to a meeting. It should be recognized that all
                        Presidential candidates will want to send advisers to such a meeting.</p>
                    <p>First we should find out what each NATO member will do in the light of the
                        Soviet action in Czechoslovakia. They should speak up and be clear about
                        specific actions. The results of the meeting cannot be such as to encourage
                        the aggressors to think that we are not concerned by the Soviet invasion nor
                        such as to lead some people to think that our reaction has been too weak. We
                        should consult, especially with the military leaders, before any decision is
                        made. In addition, we should not have a highly publicized meeting until we
                        know what the other members are prepared to do.</p>
                    <p>We should not reassure the Germans until they take action on some of the
                        things we want them to do. There is no need to restate our commitments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: Even before the
                        Czech crisis, the increasing deficit in our balance of payments, projected
                        through 1972, was higher than we can accept. (The deficit figures are in the
                        attached paper which was cited by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>.) (Tab D) </p>
                    <p>The procurement of U.S. military supplies by European NATO members could have
                        greatly helped our balance of payments problem. If <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0783"/>such procurement is made, we can avoid the
                        choice between withdrawing troops from Europe and facing an unacceptable
                        financial risk. Many Europeans believe we are more anxious to defend Europe
                        than they are. Unless we make it clear to them, they are likely to let us
                        defend Western Europe with our resources.</p>
                    <p>It is well to recall that the Berlin crisis led to the first agreement by a
                        NATO member to offset our military expenditures in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Any NATO meeting held now should include the Finance Ministers so that costs
                        can be dealt with along with military and political problems. Treasury has
                        listed several proposals it recommends in its paper.</p>
                    <p>The President: We should first get the views of what NATO members are doing
                        and will do in response to the Czech crisis. Unless we do, we might have a
                        big meeting of Foreign, Defense, and Finance Ministers which could blow up
                        without agreement.</p>
                    <p>We should start by asking our Ambassadors to find out from Foreign, Defense
                        and Finance Ministers what kind of money, marbles, and chalk the NATO states
                        are prepared to put in to counter the Soviet threat. After they have this
                        information, the Ambassadors might come here to tell us exactly what they
                        have found out.</p>
                    <p>General Wheeler: The threat to NATO is greater now than prior to the Czech
                        crisis because:</p>
                    <p>a. Warsaw Pact troops have been moved westward,</p>
                    <p>b. the Warsaw Pact states have partially mobilized, and</p>
                    <p>c. there are more Soviet troops deployed in the satellite states. The Soviets
                        are on the alert and will stay on the alert.</p>
                    <p>General Spivey <note n="5" xml:id="d324fn5">Lieutenant General Berton E.
                            Spivey, Director, Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff.</note> reports
                        from Brussels that NATO military leaders are alarmed and deeply disturbed by
                        the Czech situation. They think NATO should pull up its socks and that a
                        NATO meeting would help.</p>
                    <p>The answer to the question of which NATO members would do something specific
                        about strengthening the Alliance is:</p>
                    <p>a. The Germans, the Italians and the Dutch have the resources needed to build
                        up their military forces. The question is whether they have the will do do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>b. Possibly the Norwegians and the Danes would do more.</p>
                    <p>c. The British attitude is uncertain because their current military power is
                        being reduced.</p>
                    <p>The President: We should have our Ambassadors go to the Germans, the Italians
                        and the Dutch to find out specifically what they are willing to do now to
                        strengthen NATO.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: [Here follow 2

                    <p>There should be no NATO meeting without knowing in advance what is to come
                        out of it. As to the effect of a NATO meeting, it would have no affect on
                        the Soviet leaders but in the world it would be taken as a sign that the
                        cold war was starting up all over again. The Soviets could use this argument
                        to bring back into line the European communist parties which fell away
                        following the Czech invasion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>: A NATO meeting
                        would be used by those Soviet leaders who opposed the invasion to show their
                        colleagues just how much the Soviet action cost. There is no solid evidence
                        on who favored and who opposed the invasion in the Soviet leadership.</p>

                    <p>“Dear <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Manlio</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Since the invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 20, we, like you, have been
                        thinking deeply about the best response which the NATO Alliance might make,
                        both in real terms and in relation to public opinion in Europe, America and
                        around the world. In the early days of the invasion we felt that the
                        uncomfortable spotlight of the United Nations on the Soviet action should be
                        kept bright and that for the moment activity through NATO should be kept out
                        of public view. This posture on the part of the NATO Alliance has in no way
                        prevented intensive consultations <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0785"/>in NATO on the military, intelligence and political levels and has well
                        served its purpose.</p>
                    <p>But we are now thinking, as you no doubt know, of the need for a more
                        publicly active role for NATO as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        debate dies down and the need grows for public opinion in the Atlantic
                        Community to be assured that the Alliance remains in place and will continue
                        to be effective despite any changes in the military posture or deployment in
                        the countries of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                    <p>The problem as I see it is this. How can we best bring about a meas-ured
                        reaction of the NATO Alliance so that it will be clear to its people that
                        NATO continues with all strength to meet any challenge while avoiding a
                        provocative NATO stance that could polarize the problem in terms of a
                        confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact rather than between the
                        Soviets and the rest of the world—including some of the Communist world.</p>
                    <p>This is a difficult prescription and may contain within it some internal
                        contradictions. It is indeed for this reason I ask your advice as Secretary
                        General as to what you think we all ought to do.</p>
                    <p>Our own thoughts at this moment are best stated, I think, by saying, on the
                        one hand, that a visible NATO reaction this fall is required but that, on
                        the other hand, it would be a mistake to call an urgent high-level meeting
                        of Foreign, Defense and Financial Ministers of NATO merely for the purpose
                        of issuing a declaration or communique without real content. Surely we have
                        enough words on paper. Another reaffirmation of what we have said before
                        runs the risk that it would be regarded as an empty gesture in both the East
                        and the West.</p>
                    <p>From these considerations we have formed the tentative conclusion that it
                        would be best to have a series of intensive consultations on what each of
                        the NATO countries might be prepared to do in terms of a positive
                        contribution to the strengthening of NATO before we reach the point of
                        calling for a full-scale NATO Ministerial meeting at a date prior to the
                        normal December exercise.</p>
                    <p>A possible procedure, to which we are giving thought and on which the
                        President and I would very much like your views would be the following:</p>
                    <p>We might begin with a special NATO meeting toward the end of September to
                        which each member would send a Deputy Foreign Minister who would begin the
                        process of consultation on the possibilities for real action later on. This
                        meeting might be followed up by a meeting of the NATO Foreign Ministers
                        under your chairmanship, which could be held in New York between October 1
                        and 10 when many Foreign Ministers would in any event be present. The
                        advantage of this locale is that it would not tend to have the drama of a
                        Brussels meeting but would provide the occasion for consultation. The
                        Foreign Ministers meeting in <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0786"/>New
                        York could then, if there were general agreement and it appeared that a
                        full-scale NATO Ministerial meeting would be productive of concrete results,
                        bring about such a meeting in Brussels, possibly in late October or early
                        November—in short speeding up the December Ministerial Meeting in the light
                        of the new situation created by the invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>We may have before us a period when it will be politically possible for each
                        member to take steps that would provide the desired reinforcement of our
                        NATO institution in a way which might not have been possible a few weeks
                        ago. The opportunity should not be lost; but neither should we proceed in a
                        way that would lead to insignificant results or could worsen an already
                        dangerous situation. I think this problem needs our best thought. I would
                        appreciate knowing whatever you may have to suggest on the best way to
                        proceed.</p>

                        <item>The President's Meeting with Dr. Kurt Birrenbach Friday, September 13,
                            5:15 p.m.</item>
                        <item>(The President, Dr. Birrenbach, German Charge von Stackelberg, Ed
                            Fried)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p> Birrenbach told the President that the Chancellor had asked him to come here
                        to describe German concerns over the situation in Europe following the
                        Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and to get an understanding of United
                        States thinking.</p>
                    <p>He stressed the following:</p>
                    <p>1. The additional Soviet divisions on the German front and the threat they
                        posed.</p>
                    <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0787"/>
                    <p>2. The clear evidence of the unpredictability of Soviet policy which he
                        attributed, in part, to collective leadership—and the dangers this carried

                    <p>He said that it was necessary to strengthen NATO and outlined his helpful

                        what might be done and on the various possibilities for a NATO

                    <p>The President asked Birrenbach to give the Chancellor his best wishes and to
                        tell him that he remembered with warmth the hospitality the Chancellor had
                        shown him in Germany.<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had visited Bonn in April 1967
                            to attend the funeral of former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</note> He said he believed that we had had a
                        unique relationship with the Germans in the post-war period, and that he
                        personally had great respect for the abilities and character of the German
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The President said he believed that the future of Germany was largely in
                        their own hands. Germany had made a phenomenal comeback since the war and
                        was now in a position to take the lead in responding to the present crisis.
                        The people of the United States had never been reluctant to discharge their
                        obligations and responsibilities, but, if they were to get concerned about
                        the present situation, they needed to be shown that the Europeans were
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>The situation now was much more serious and dangerous than the average man
                        believed. He had given much thought to how he could help to strengthen NATO
                        before he went out of office. The elections in the U.S. were a complicating
                        factor because any moves without substance could lead to accusations that he
                        was meddling in politics. That was another reason why it was important for
                        Europeans to take the lead.</p>
                    <p>He pointed out the strength of feeling behind the Symington amendment.
                        (Symington's views were all the more surprising since he came from a German
                        community and had himself had experience in the Defense Department.) The
                        Czech crisis had stopped this movement, but the proponents will be back in
                        due time to chip away again. Nothing to damage NATO would be done in his
                        Administration, but what would happen in the next Administration was another
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>It was essential, therefore, for Europe to take matters in its own hands. The
                        time was ripe for a bold move to strengthen NATO and the key was what the
                        Germans and our other NATO partners are prepared to do in terms of concrete
                        actions. What happens here will depend on that. <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0788"/>He said he realized there were advantages to having the top
                        leaders get together to see what could be done, what the problems are and
                        what solutions could be worked out. It was better for guidance to come from
                        the top rather than for Foreign Ministers to report to their heads of
                        government. But, if that did not prove possible, something could be done in
                        a Foreign Ministers meeting in New York. Again the key was what the other
                        nations are prepared to do.</p>
                    <p>He said he asked that his Ambassadors in Europe discuss this specifically
                        with European Governments and he was awaiting reports now. He would be very
                        disappointed if the answer was only to tell us about their difficulties.</p>
                    <p>We were faced with enough problems of our own: Our casualties and
                        expenditures in Vietnam, our balance of payments problem, our deficit of $25
                        billion, the demands for aid.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of this, he had been willing to make his statement on Rumania,
                        showing where we stood. We will be ready to do our part.</p>
                    <p>His schedule had been unusually heavy and he had cancelled appointments in
                        order to talk to Birrenbach as <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>'s representative. He thought very highly of the
                        Chancellor, of his moderation and of his ability. He wanted him to know that
                        he believed this to be a very dangerous situation. But the first move must
                        be by the people who are in the cone of the volcano. The American people are
                        slow to awaken, but they cannot be expected to be concerned about people who
                        do not show by concrete actions that they are concerned about
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p> Birrenbach said he understood the President's views and would convey them to
                        the Chancellor. He knew very clearly that the United States understood the
                        situation in Europe and he agreed completely that if we do not take
                        advantage of the present situation we may not have another opportunity. He
                        thanked the President for his statement on Berlin and he asked whether
                        Senator Mansfield's statement on the future deployment of forces had a lot
                        of support.</p>
                    <p>The President said the situation was very acute. The leadership in the
                        Congress had been strongly in favor of reduction of forces in Europe. He had
                        been opposed and had fought hard to prevent reductions and he would be able
                        to do so as long as he was in office. But before Czechoslovakia, support for
                        troop reductions was so strong that as a compromise it might have been
                        necessary to schedule reductions of 50,000 to 100,000 men.</p>
                    <p> Birrenbach asked to what extent the offset question was in back of the drive
                        for troop reductions. </p>
                    <p>The President said it was an important factor but not the only one. It was a
                        long time since the end of World War II and Americans felt they had a right
                        to ask Europeans to do more themselves. The balance of payments problem on
                        troops had to be solved but there also had to be other <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0789"/>actions which showed that the Europeans
                        were willing to open their pocketbooks and put their resources on the line
                        for defense.</p>
                    <p>The real question that the Europeans must face is what will happen in the
                        next Administration. He felt that the Europeans were sleeping while Rome
                        burns. Isolationist sentiment here was latent and becoming more serious.</p>
                    <p>We have tried and will continue to work closely with Germany. He had told the
                        Chancellor that he should try to work with DeGaulle. He had also said that
                        the flirtation probably would not work and that Germany would probably have
                        to come back to the same old girl ultimately. He had himself avoided any
                        confrontation with DeGaulle and refused to be provoked by him.</p>
                    <p>As far as the Russians are concerned, he had told them clearly that we were
                        against aggression; that we have our obligations to the Germans and we mean
                        to keep them. But we have problems to try to work out with the Russians from
                        disarmament on down. And if we don't want war, we have to see whether it is
                        possible to work out anything with them.</p>
                    <p>The Russians were trying to catch us off guard before our elections. The
                        President said he had been ready to talk to them about common problems, but
                        Czechoslovakia had stopped that. But the problems didn't go away.</p>
                    <p>The key was for the Chancellor and the other leaders of our European allies
                        to say they believe that the Russian moves in Czechoslovakia have created a
                        serious situation in Europe and therefore are going to do the following
                        specific things. Armed with such a statement, the President said he could
                        get support for actions the U.S. could take.</p>
                    <p>He hoped that the Chancellor would tell Ambassador Lodge what his own ideas
                        are and what he believed our other NATO allies in Europe could do.</p>
                    <p> Birrenbach thanked the President for the opportunity to talk to him and said
                        his visit here would help give the Chancellor a better idea of United States
                        thinking and of the need for action that could strengthen our position in
                        the present situation.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said that no one regretted the exclusion of Spain from the
                        European defense community more than the U.S. He said that we believe that
                        this is due to the internal politics of three or four countries. The
                        Secretary said he also understood the Spanish did not want to submit
                        themselves to the scrutiny of other European countries. He said that the
                        U.S. had made efforts on several occasions to have Spain included in NATO.
                        The Secretary said that we had reached a point where Belgian Prime Minister
                        Spaak had been willing to proceed, but then Spaak had left office. The
                        Secretary said that in some cases the governments of the countries mentioned
                        had no serious objections to Spanish participation but were afraid of
                        domestic opposition and for this reason were unwilling to proceed. </p>
                    <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0791"/>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said he was grateful for the U.S. posture expressed not
                        only by the Department of State but also by Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would raise the question of Spanish membership in NATO
                        with the NATO foreign ministers later this fall in New York and see what
                        their reaction would be.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister interrupted and said that Spain was not asking for U.S.
                        intervention with the NATO ministers nor for membership. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he would not leave with any of the ministers the
                        impression that Spain had raised the question, but he said he would try to
                        discover if there had been any change in their attitude. He said that he
                        understood fully that Spain was not applying for membership.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Castiella said that Spain asked only to be heard—not to be a
                        member. He said there is a strong movement in Spain which favors a policy of
                        neutrality. He cited the example of Morocco which, as a non-aligned nation,
                        received aid from both the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that the problem was not as simple as that and said
                        that he would like to have the opportunity to discuss sometime at greater
                        length with the Foreign Minister the question of Morocco.</p>

                    <p>21254. Summary. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        carefully restricted conversation at today's 50-minute meeting to one issue,
                        namely, Germany. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        is planning his own position for his meeting with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> and he is reverting with
                        singleminded concentration to his thesis that U.S. commitments to
                        territorial integrity of Western European countries, especially Germany, are
                        inadequate. It is this inadequacy which explains, in his mind, why the
                        Germans are so disturbed and edgy. Despite his repeated suggestions that the
                        U.S. was not sufficiently committed to European defense to allay West German
                        worries, he repeatedly refused to give any indication that France would
                        undertake any new commitments or make any new statements, public or private,
                        bilateral or multilateral, for the security of the Western world.</p>

                    <p>I. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> opened the conversation
                        immediately with a question asking for our evaluation of the Czech invasion.
                        I responded in detail utilizing the Department's 242962.<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2">Telegram 242962, September 21, transmitted instructions
                            on Vietnam and relations with the Soviet Union. (Ibid.)</note> I
                        emphasized that invasion had created new military situation which in turn
                        required collective action as well as bilateral action by Western European
                        countries to strengthen military deterrent as best antidote to possible
                        Soviet recklessness. I referred specifically to need for larger conventional
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> responded by stating that
                        in his opinion the Soviets could be expected to continue and heighten their
                        propaganda war against West Germany, that they would maintain pressure all
                        along the line, psychological, military, diplomatic, that it was to their
                        advantage to keep a fear of Germany alive in Europe and to utilize
                        revanchism as an excuse for strengthening their position throughout the
                        satellite nations. I noted that although the Russians were using alleged
                        activities by West Germans in Czechoslovakia as an excuse for their own
                        invasion, there was no evidence of any Western nation threatening
                        Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that
                        in his judgment the Russians were worried by the threat of a revitalized
                        Germany joining with Czech and perhaps even East Germany, plus the Chinese,
                        in joint actions against Russia itself. The Russians, he said, were not
                        worried about the current situation in which there was nothing to justify
                        such a massive action as the Russians had undertaken against Czech. Rather
                        it was the spectre of China and Germany working together against Russia in
                        the next five or ten years that was the real cause of their alarm and
                        actions. He repeated that he anticipated further diplomatic, economic,
                        psychological warfare by the Russians against the East Germans looking
                        toward the day when having built a sufficient foundation, the Russians would
                        invade Hanover or Hamburg. Whereupon he asked: if the Russians did invade
                        West Germany if they did breach the western frontiers of Germany, what would
                        the U.S. do? </p>
                    <p>II. Responding to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                        questions I drew heavily on the Department's 241284<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">Dated September 19. (Ibid.)</note> affirming that the
                        U.S. has always fulfilled its treaty responsibilities; that the President
                        himself had reaffirmed our commitments to the Alliance in recent meetings
                        with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>; that we have informed the Soviets
                        that we intend to keep our obligations to the Germans; but that our
                        government would be greatly assisted by a show of determination and
                        commitment from the countries of Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> responded by saying that no
                        country in Europe had sufficient power to stand up to the Russians and that,
                        in fact, even collectively the European countries do not have sufficient
                        power. Thus, he said, the first question remained: what would the U.S. do? I
                        repeated that the U.S. <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0793"/>had a record
                        of living up to its treaty obligations and that our country would do so in
                        this case even if it meant war. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> asked whether or not the U.S. would be prepared to
                        respond immediately with our nuclear power if the borders of Germany were
                        violated, to which I responded that our country would probably not respond
                        initially with nuclear weapons to an invasion by conventional forces.
                        Rather, we would first want to utilize our own conventional forces together
                        with those of our European allies, that we wished to avoid a nuclear
                        holocaust. I pointed out that these were my own opinions, that I had no
                        instructions from my government on this issue, but that since he had raised
                        the question I would like to know from him what France's response would be
                        if the Soviets invaded Hanover or Hamburg as he had suggested.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> responded that it was not a
                        question of France's response because France didn't have the power to
                        respond adequately to such an attack that France's response would be
                        controlled by the U.S. response; but that if the U.S. responded with all of
                        its power, France would respond with all of its power.</p>
                    <p>I asked him if he would advise me in greater detail with his own opinion of
                        France's response to an invasion of West Germany. He responded by saying an
                        invasion of West Germany was not an invasion of France; that France had no
                        common border with Russia; and that France must look to its own life and
                        death and to its own future. He said explicitly that the U.S. would do the
                        same and he made it clear that in his judgment the U.S. would not risk
                        nuclear war for the defense of Western Europe. Apparently he believes that
                        since France would not respond to a military invasion of West Germany by
                        deploying all of its resources, neither would the U.S., and because the U.S.
                        would not really make an absolute commitment of its military power both
                        conventional and nuclear to Germany, the Germans are worried and will
                        continue to be worried no matter what the French, English or Italians say or
                        do.</p>
                    <p>At three different points in our conversation I specifically asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to suggest what the U.S. could
                        do, above and beyond what we have already done, to allay his doubts and the
                        doubts which he says the Germans have. What could be done, I said, to
                        convince you that the U.S. will live up to its obligations?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was unwilling or unable to
                        suggest any action, public or private. Moreover when I suggested that France
                        might well consider enlarging its own commitments, intensifying its military
                        cooperation with Germany, and reestablishing contacts with the military
                        forces of the Alliance, he declined to respond either negatively or
                        positively. Our conversation concluded with his observation that the subject
                        we were discussing was immense and that we would have many additional
                        opportunities to talk about it, that he welcomed this exchange of views and
                        looked forward to seeing me again.</p>
                    <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0794"/>
                    <p>He made no allusion to Vietnam and gave me no occasion to do so before he
                        indicated his time had run out.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> appeared to be
                        in good health and in a good frame of mind. He even smiled warmly and said
                        “thank you very much” in English when, as I was leaving, I congratulated him
                        for his courage and vision in supporting the new educational reforms
                        proposed by Edgar Faure in which so much emphasis is placed on
                        decentralization and reliance on youth.</p>

                    <p>245249. Subj: UK Accession.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> called in Minister Tompkins
                        of British Embassy September 25 to make following points. </p>
                    <p>A. We understand German package for September 27 EC Council meeting contains
                        very vague language on UK membership. Germans, in attempt to respond to
                        French positions, are not dealing squarely with problem of UK accession.
                        German proposal now seems to have Italian, Belgian and Dutch support.
                        Arrangement such as contemplated by Germans would give us trouble as it
                        would be nothing except discriminatory trade arrangement with no clear
                        progress on membership.</p>
                    <p>B. Although we have made our position clear to the Germans and others we have
                        thus far not injected ourselves actively into this discussion and thought
                            <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would agree that this was wise. Our
                        policy not to intervene was based on our understanding that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> shared our views against a purely
                        commercial arrangement. We would welcome anything Tomkins could do to
                        reassure us that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would not be interested
                        in halfway house.</p>
                    <p>2. Tompkins replied that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has had
                        discussions with Belgians and Dutch who are not enthusiastic about German
                        proposals but want some negotiations to open.</p>
                    <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0795"/>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out there seemed to
                        be possibility of trap if the four go along with German proposal. French may
                        conceivably accept purely commercial arrangement. Such development would
                        face HMG with difficult problem and cause us problems as well.</p>
                    <p>4. Tompkins replied as far as he could tell from cables trade agreement by
                        itself unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>. He did indicate,
                        however, that if there were unanimous agreement by Six on offer, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would have to look at it. He also said that
                        much may depend on how other two points pertaining to Marechal study on
                        technological cooperation and study on Community enlargement emerged. He
                        thought, however, that these two points would not be of great interest
                        unless UK were involved in the two studies from an early date. His personal
                        view was that trade agreement would be unacceptable unless specific
                        reference was contained to eventual British membership. However he promised
                        seek assurance from London as requested by <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> that British position has in fact not changed.<note n="2" xml:id="d329fn2">On September 28, the Department of State reported
                            further that the British would accept a commercial arrangement with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> only if the offer were made by all
                            six Community members and if it were clearly linked to full membership.

                        welter of discussion over texts and procedural processing of various
                        assessments. Only Netherlands Representative Boon (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> 5004, paragraph 10) has grasped the
                        central issue of need for decisions, i.e., an agreed NATO Minute, approved
                        on an ad interim basis by Permanent Representatives.</p>
                    <p>3. If other Permanent Representatives continue present stalling tactics which
                        seem certain to immure us in yet another meaningless paper exercise in order
                        to accommodate French and/or others, you should immediately exert maximum
                        leadership to guide proceedings along track similar to that we found
                        ourselves forced to follow to bring <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> exercise to a successful conclusion. Those steps are
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. In <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> work out the best agreed
                        conclusions that you can achieve.</p>
                    <p>b. In <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> you may also “note” assessments as
                        necessary and useful background but under no circumstances should you allow
                        us to become trapped in the endless negotiation of textual changes.</p>
                    <p>c. Our objective is concise, well-worded Agreed Minute which would provide
                        needed umbrella for national contributions to NATO to improve capabilities.
                        Our first choice is achieve this in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.
                        However, if this clearly not possible, you should immediately convene <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> and get on with working out an ad
                        referendum Agreed Minute containing constructive conclusions and
                        recommendations which the Foreign Ministers can usefully address when they
                        meet with the Secretary in New York on October 7.</p>

                    <p>1. European caucus idea may now have more potential life than at any previous
                        time; we agree with reftel that the best way to nurse it along is not to
                        crush it in a US embrace.</p>
                    <p>2. It seems likely there will be considerable discussion around edges of NPG
                        Bonn meeting about the defense topics that might be discussed among British
                        and some or all of the European Five. Healey apparently intends to raise
                        question with Schroeder, and reftels indicate Germans may for first time be
                        receptive. Lively interest of Dutch and Belgians is predictable. And if
                        everybody else is doing it, Italians will join in too.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>'s intentions
                        as reported by Embassy London, UK PermRep Burrows already has general
                        instructions to confer informally here with his continental colleagues, and
                        is talking with Belgian PermRep <persName corresp="#p_DSAM1">De
                            Staercke</persName> about arranging informal Europe-only gathering.</p>
                    <p>4. If they stick to NATO defense topics, UK plus the Five can automatically
                        avoid the French problem, since France has so clearly opted out of the whole
                        process of <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> consideration of defense
                        implications of recent Soviet behavior in Eastern Europe. This line was
                        drawn early, clearly, and without heartburn this week in discussion that led
                        to agreed DPC decision paper (<gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss>
                            5085).<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">Telegram 5085, October 4, transmitted

                    <p>5. Burrows has sought assurance that some European caucusing among NATO
                        colleagues would be all right with us. I have said that has been and remains
                        our position: the more European initiative in NATO, the better.</p>
                    <p>6. But would stongly advise against any public advocacy of this trend by
                        American spokesmen. The shoots are tender, and too much watering may drown
                        them.</p>

                    <p>(The following record of the discussion at the Secretary's dinner was
                        prepared by Mr. Alec Toumayan and Mr. Peter Sebastian who served as
                        interpreters during the dinner.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary first suggested that a date for the November Ministerial
                        Meeting be set informally and after some discussion it was determined that
                        the 14th, 15th and 16th of November were the most convenient dates. The
                        meeting of the NATO Parliamentarians in Brussels that week was not
                        considered to be an obstacle. There was a brief discussion about the nature
                        and length of the November meeting and the Secretary said that the November
                        meeting was a substitute for the December meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> agreed that the November meeting was
                        a regular meeting. He noted that Defense Ministers might have to meet again
                        in December to approve the necessary force planning steps.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> to
                        explain what the Council had done with respect to Czechoslovakia. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> explained that he could not
                        add much to what the Ministers already knew. He wanted to draw attention to
                        certain aspects of the military and political reports<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">The texts of the “Summary Assessment of the
                            Implications of the Czechoslovak Crisis” was transmitted in telegram
                            5084 from Brussels, October 4. (Ibid., DEF 4 NATO) Regarding the
                            military report, see <ref target="#d331fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                331</ref>.</note> that had been prepared and of their conclusions:
                        some practical measures had been taken in the area of crisis management. He
                        noted that some delays had been encountered in collection and dissemination
                        of information. A promising development was the fact that we now had a
                        Situation Center; we did not have it in Paris and had taken advantage of our
                        move to Brussels to establish it. It was now a new part of the organization
                        which was working well and was useful.</p>
                    <p>There were three reports—military, political and procedural. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> would now sum up the summary. The
                        political report contained an evaluation, a prudent one, which was a
                        compromise of all opinions <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0799"/>expressed. It was not daring. Its value was that it was a unanimous report
                        by the fifteen. It considered that the action of the Soviet Union against
                        Czechoslovakia was essentially a defensive action caused by Soviet concern
                        over the erosion of the communist empire and by their desire to maintain
                        their control over the communist countries. The conclusion of the report
                        agreed that there were dangerous implications in the intervention because of
                        the high degree of uncertainty that now existed in Eastern and Western
                        Europe. The report reflected the impact on Yugoslavia and Romania, and
                        concern over the presence of communist troops near the German border. There
                        was uncertainty in Europe about the further readiness of the Russians to use
                        force. The impact of the situation went beyond central Europe and was felt
                        in all Europe and in the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>The policies suggested were cautious and prudent. We should affirm our
                        intention to improve and extend East-West relations, not losing sight of a
                        possible European Security Pact. The need for solidarity within the Alliance
                        was stressed, as was the fact that the pursuit of a detente should not
                        weaken or split the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>The actions recommended contained no bold formulations. Some points were
                        raised: 1) The need to make plans and to make very clear the consequences of
                        any aggression against NATO countries. 2) It was agreed to continue to
                        develop relations with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union but with
                        discretion and moderation so as not to appear in any way to condone Soviet
                        aggression. 3) Continued military efforts were called for to strengthen
                        Western security, noting that this is a long-term objective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> wished to make two
                        additional points: the need to make a statement on solidarity with Germany
                        and to study what the attitude of the Alliance would be if Romania,
                        Yugoslavia or another country became involved in a crisis.</p>
                    <p>The military report had been approved by the 14 members of the DPC. It aimed
                        especially at remedying current shortcomings. All agreed on the need to
                        carry on the effort to bring manning levels and training up to standards; to
                        improve and correct force levels and the equipment of reserve units; to
                        increase the frequency of exercises; to improve the conventional role of the
                        air force as distinct from its nuclear role; and to make general
                        recommendations to the countries to dedicate sufficient resources to fulfill
                        the goals and bring up the forces to the 1969 levels. The report also
                        recommended a series of studies.</p>
                    <p>This completed the summary of the two reports which reached the conclusion
                        that a firm response of the Alliance was needed. What was contained in the
                        reports was in effect a minimum consensus. Two additional points deserved to
                        be stressed: one was contained in the report and the other was implied in
                        it. The report made a distinction between the <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0800"/>short term and long term effect of the Czechoslovakian
                        crisis on detente. The suppression of liberalization forces would make
                        detente more difficult in the short term, but the long term effect might
                        well be that these forces could not be repressed. The second point was that
                        we must reach a determination in our mind as to whether the Soviet Union's
                        policy was, on balance, defensive or offensive.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> stated that with the
                        Czechoslovakian intervention the Soviets had embarked on a new policy, in
                        which military and political considerations took precedence over ideological
                        considerations. There should not be a complete lack of response on the part
                        of NATO. We should not limit ourselves to expressing our disgust and our
                        worry. Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> continued that he
                        and his government had been struck by the attacks directed against Germany.
                        There was a clear difference between a state of peace and a state of war,
                        but we now live in a twilight zone in which the Russians may be tempted to
                        move further. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> stressed that
                        his country would do its share in increasing the defense capability of NATO.
                        He was not in a position to make a pledge but he could state that the
                        Netherlands would follow the recommendations of the Council. He drew
                        attention to the fact that the Netherlands defense budget had already been
                        substantially increased and that the figures now being made public had been
                        set before the Czechoslovakian crisis. The sums budgeted for defense would
                        be raised further. He hoped that all NATO countries, and in particular the
                        most powerful member of the Alliance, would draw the necessary conclusions
                        from the willingness of the European countries to do more.</p>
                    <p>Minister Debre considered that the documents would be studied further in
                        November. He stressed that his government viewed the reports as working
                        documents only. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName> drew his
                        attention to the differences between the military and the political reports.
                        The military report had not been approved by the French government which had
                        not participated in its preparation. The political report had been approved,
                        and its summary conclusions had also been approved with one exception only
                        by the French delegation. The document therefore remains before the Council.
                        It is not a document of the Council.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> stated that his
                        government welcomes the study of the political and military aspects and
                        views these reports as a good basis for the November meetings. The German
                        government would, he felt sure, implement its recommendations. But even
                        before the November meeting, he would welcome a statement, a joint statement
                        if possible, on the Alliance so that there can be no misjudgment on the part
                        of the Russians. He would be happy if we could all agree that we intend the
                        Alliance to continue. There are measures that need to be taken with respect
                        to what had happened and with respect to the Soviet presence in
                        Czechoslovakia. Even before the November meeting we should stress <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0801"/>that NATO viewed a move against
                        Yugoslavia as a very serious development for Europe and the world. We
                        sometimes hear the excuse that the Soviets act to maintain the integrity of
                        the Warsaw Pact. His view was that they act to preserve their supremacy over
                        their pact. It should be clearly underlined that solidarity is indivisible
                        and he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> that we
                        cannot exclude the possibility of new dangers. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was willing to participate in serious discussions on these
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>Regarding defense, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> pointed out
                        that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is close to the Czechoslovak
                        border and has to be both watchful and careful; the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has to take into consideration not only the Soviet Union
                        but the fact that some of its friends would not like to see a German
                        contribution larger than what they feel they can accept. In conclusion the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would go along with the steps
                        outlined and this would include budgetary meas-ures. He felt that we should
                        begin to implement some of the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>
                        recommendations even before the Brussels meeting in improving quality even
                        more than the force levels. His government would certainly try to raise the
                        quality of the troops, their effectiveness and their capabilities to bring
                        them up to the levels dictated by their equipment.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> stated that what the
                        Russians are saying in effect is “if we think it necessary in the interest
                        of our alliance, we will invade one of our allies”. This is the situation we
                        are faced with. It is an attitude which we of course in the NATO Alliance
                        would never hold. It makes a clear response, both military and political,
                        imperative on the part of NATO. Consideration must also be given to other
                        countries which are neither in NATO or the Warsaw Pact. What would be NATO's
                        attitude if such countries were attacked by the USSR? There was a feeling
                        among certain Europeans that if they did more for the Alliance then the U.S.
                        would do less. No European should even feel that this would be so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> thought that NATO governments
                        should give thought to possible statements, joint or national, that they
                        might make on the continuation of the Alliance. Such statements might be
                        made in November—or prior to the November meeting. They might be definite,
                        viz., they might state that the Alliance continued for a stated number of
                        years. Or they might simply make it clear that the Alliance would continue
                        well beyond 1969—the year in which members are entitled to give notice of
                        their intention to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated he wished to comment briefly on his conversation with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d332fn4">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (SecDel/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/16) at

                            69 D 182, CF 321.</note> The Secretary stated he was convinced we must
                        take the new Soviet doctrine seriously. It is a doctrine which is not
                        limited geographically. The socialist “Commonwealth” has no geographical
                        boundaries. It is not coterminous with the Warsaw Pact. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0802"/>refused to discuss Czechoslovakia with the Secretary
                        indicating that he could not discuss that matter with any government. The
                        Secretary stated that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech, the Pravda article to
                        which he (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>) had referred in
                        his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> remarks,<note n="5" xml:id="d332fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s address to the
                            General Assembly on October 2, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 21, 1968, pp. 405–410. The article in Pravda
                            appeared in the September 25 edition. For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s address to the General
                            Assembly on October 3, see U.N. Doc. A/PV. 1679, pp. 6–14.</note> and
                        his conversation with the Soviet Foreign Minister strongly suggested that we
                        were in the presence of a new or revived doctrine, the full effect of which
                        we have not yet determined. The Soviets have given us strong assurances
                        regarding Romania and Berlin (on Berlin these assurances were repeated by
                        Gromyko last night). But they are worth what they are worth. If the Soviets
                        are contemplating further moves, these “assurances” may have been designed
                        to mislead us. We must be watchful. The November meeting can be important if
                        it reflects a political solution and decisions on military measures to
                        demonstrate that NATO intends to look to its defenses. In June we had talked
                        about the mutual reduction of forces in Europe but we were now seeing an
                        increase in Soviet forces in central Europe with a southward thrust into
                        Czechoslovakia. Regarding Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>'s comments on the US attitude, if there was a
                        feeling in the US that we were asked to do a great deal because others were
                        doing less than their share, then of course this would place us in an
                        impossible situation. However, the others would hear from the US by the
                        November meeting, if not before, on what measures the US can take in the
                        defense field. Regarding a statement on the duration of the Alliance, we
                        have no problem with a statement of policy, but Ministers would understand
                        that, any constitutional requirements levied upon the US, for example,
                        anything requiring Senate action, would have to be left for the new
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>Minister Debre remarked that since Ministers would discuss these matters at
                        the November meeting he would be brief today. First we must know what we
                        want and what the situation is as we see it. One speaks of the need for a
                        response, but what is its nature? A few battalions—a little equipment—this
                        represents no real supplementary effort and has only drawbacks.</p>
                    <p>The real question is: have we entered or are we entering into a period of
                        preparation for conflict? If so, all we have been talking about here is
                        insignificant. If we are entering such a period, we must have discussions
                        with the US regarding its nuclear intentions for the defense of Europe. If,
                        on the other hand, we think we have not entered into such a period, if we
                        believe instead that this is the beginning of a process essentially based on
                        a Soviet defensive reaction, the problem is not immediate, since it may be a
                        process that will last for three, four or five years. For a number of years
                            <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0803"/>we have been going in a certain
                        direction. The Soviet government has now committed an act which is morally
                        and politically inadmissible. But should we react with token military
                        measures thus appearing to take a position which may not be maintained, made
                        effective, or be pertinent in the months to come? At our November meeting we
                        must talk more and deeply about the key question of our interpretation of
                        Soviet policies. There are two assumptions: 1) The Soviets threaten our
                        military security: in this case, the only thing worth talking about is the
                        nuclear support of the US. 2) The problem is essentially political. There we
                        must study the relations between the Soviet Union and the other Eastern
                        countries, and examine our attitude with respect to attacks on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. We must take these questions up more
                        seriously than in a short discussion. For a month and half, Mr. Debre said,
                        he had heard statements about re-inforcing the Alliance, but all he had
                        heard represented only drawbacks and no advantages. We all said we were
                        shocked by the Soviet policies, but what do we do tomorrow if Yugoslavia is
                        invaded or if there is other military action? That is a real question. The
                        Soviet government certainly knows that European countries are prepared to
                        defend themselves. We need more serious study of these matters. Perhaps the
                        best service we can render the Czechoslovaks and Eastern European countries
                        is to focus on the problems of Germany and continue to show the Soviet
                        government that it has committed an error; that if it pulls out its troops
                        then conversations can be resumed between the US and the Soviet Union, and
                        other detente projects can be pursued once more. Debre felt the issues were
                        so serious that he hesitated to speak on them now. The proposed NATO
                        military measures he thought were self-satisfying and hence self-deluding
                        gestures which could have no fortunate effect—only unfortunate consequences.
                        The Secretary asked Debre if he would be prepared to have some of these
                        questions discussed by the Permanent Representatives in the Council between
                        now and the November meeting and Minister Debre replied “I don't see what
                        else they can be talking about”.</p>
                    <p>Minister Pipinellis stressed that we must pursue rearmament. Greece has
                        neglected other items of its budget in order to be able to raise the level
                        of its military forces. To deter aggression one must let the agressor know
                        that if he tries to invade things will be difficult for him. This is what
                        Tito is now doing. He has submitted a bill to his parliament providing for
                        the creation of a national (guerilla) army to continue to fight after the
                        regular military forces have been defeated. We must also raise the
                        Alliance's standard of credibility which has sunk very low in the last few
                        months. The Russians believe there will be no reaction if they attack a
                        country which is not in the Warsaw Pact. If there is a doubt, they will
                        hesitate and consider more seriously. They do not want messy conflicts. They
                        will not want to do what Hitler had done in waging a two-front war. They
                        have China at their backs. We must take these factors into account <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0804"/>and use them to our advantage. He
                        agreed with Minister Steward that we must announce that we all agree to
                        support NATO in the coming years, and that we accept the concept that
                        strategic implications go beyond our juridical commitments. The Alliance's
                        legal commitments are based on the 1949 situation. The strategic situation
                        has been transformed by the presence of Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia. If
                        Yugoslavia were occupied tomorrow, what would this do to Italy, Greece and
                        Germany?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that some of the Ministers' colleagues were waiting
                        in the other room and suggested that we should not try to summarize the
                        conversation for them, but should join them there. </p>

                            8<note n="3" xml:id="d333fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Files)</note>—and, <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0805"/>in your discretion, release appropriate
                        sections to participants—for detailed analysis of major themes). While
                        article dealt primarily with Czechoslovakia, some element of threat to other
                        socialist countries was certainly indirectly implied. Even though signed
                        article of this type is not most authoritative form of Soviet public
                        discourse, it seems unlikely that Pravda editors would fail to appreciate
                        implications of article on so sensitive a subject—and enunciation of
                        potentially threatening doctrine was thus deliberate. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech also contained gist of this doctrine.</p>
                    <p>c. Whatever Moscow's intentions in August may have been, the move against
                        Czechoslovakia produced a war scare elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe
                        as evidenced by various degrees of military mobilizations and alerts.
                        Romanian, Yugoslav, Albanian and even Austrian fears of the Soviet Union and
                        in turn Moscow's own perceptions of these apprehensions themselves tend to
                        color the future of Balkan politics. The Soviets for their part have not
                        been averse to putting Balkan communist countries under pressure (and the
                        Kovalev article appears to have been in part designed to keep up the
                        pressure). Moscow doubtless resented Romania's lack of support, and was
                        irritated with Tito's criticism of its action. Belgrade's criticism
                        continues unabated, but Bucharest's has subsided, presumably in recognition
                        of Soviet pressures and out of desire not further goad Soviets.</p>
                    <p>d. Bucharest is thus evidently aware of Soviet sensitivities to the more
                        fluid situation which has developed in the Balkan area, and Romania at least
                        seems intent on avoiding actions which Moscow would find provocative. But
                        even if Romania agrees—or has agreed during Pact Commander Marshal
                        Yakubovsky's last visit—to take part in a Warsaw Pact exercise as a means of
                        reasserting fealty to the Pact, it is unlikely that Soviet suspicions about
                        the reliability of Romania as an ally can be dispelled. </p>
                    <p>e. If tensions continue at their present level, there will remain for some
                        time apprehension that Moscow may at some point in time see the situation in
                        the Balkans as deteriorating in a way which ultimately threatens Soviet
                        strategic interests. At such a moment, serious consideration may be given to
                        a military solution. In any event, over long term, Soviet pressure tactics
                        and reactions they elicit create a less stable situation in area.</p>
                    <p>f. Within NATO, we shall, of course, have a continuing exchange of current
                        military intelligence via SitCen and we trust further cooperation among
                        attaches in checking out reports and rumors. However, the greater problem
                        may lie in a protracted period of potential danger. And in such a period
                        NATO governments face the problem of devising policies which will help
                        discourage or deter Soviet adventure but which do not exacerbate tensions in
                        the area. At this moment, we continue to <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0806"/>believe Soviets will continue to avoid moves risking
                        serious confrontation with West so long as NATO maintains its essential
                        military strength and political cohesion.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Contingency Planning</p>
                    <p>a. We believe emphasis at this time should be on non-military deterrent moves
                        we and NATO allies can take to forestall further aggression in Central and
                        Eastern Europe. (Strengthening of NATO in military field, a corollary move,
                        now under way in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.) Planning range of
                        specific political action possibilities presumably available to NATO might
                        be geared to two time phases: (1) present stage of possible but unverifiable
                        military threat, and (2) solid threat based on hard intelligence
                        information.</p>
                    <p>b. In present stage, we believe seriousness with which we view possibility of
                        invasion can best be conveyed by such means as President's “dogs of war”
                        speech August 30, Secretary's meetings with Dobrynin during that period,
                        Secretary's October 2 <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> address and
                        subsequent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.
                        Where opportunities available, two-way visits such as recently-completed
                        visit of Yugoslav Deputy Premier Gligorov to Washington, visits to Bucharest
                        by UK Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> and
                        Belgian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> and
                        forthcoming <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> visit to
                        Belgrade should be encouraged and exploited as means indicating to Soviets
                        our serious concern over any change in existing situation. We would hope
                        participants in October 16 <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> session would
                        consider similar actions for both Yugoslavia and Romania, while being
                        cautious about overloading circuit. Other useful actions during present
                        stage would be symbolic military visits of type recently completed by
                        destroyer USS Owens to Dubrovnik, background stories and journalistic leaks
                        focused on gravity of NATO assessment of situation, and appropriate public
                        reminders of previous Western assistance to Yugoslavia. Similar actions for
                        Austria in present stage include assurances our deep concern by Ambassador
                        MacArthur and US visit Foreign Minister Waldheim October 21–22.</p>
                    <p>c. In “solid threat” phase we would differentiate fairly sharply between
                        threat to Romania and Yugoslavia or Austria where invasion would be of
                        totally different dimension with strong possibility of global conflict
                        developing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Romania</p>
                    <p>Following steps might be considered: (1) another urgent, top-level meeting
                        with Soviet Ambassador for assurances no invasion planned, (2) another
                        well-advertised Presidential statement with maximum publicity, (3) early
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting to consider possible NATO
                        response, (4) emergency Security Council session, and (5) consultation with
                        Congressional leaders.</p>
                    <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0807"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Yugoslavia</p>
                    <p>Range of possibilities would include all of above plus: (1) public
                        announcement of readiness to consider Yugoslav requests for economic and/or
                        military materiel assistance, (2) legal steps to facilitate assistance to
                        Yugoslavia, (3) urgent meetings with Yugoslavs at high level, (4) cessation
                        of two-way military dependent travel, (5) restrict all civilian travel to
                        Eastern Europe and USSR, and (6) improve military alert status of NATO and
                        US forces in Europe and Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Austria</p>
                    <p>While likelihood invasion or transit of Austria by Soviet-Warsaw Pact forces
                        appears less than for Romania-Yugoslavia, we also considering possible US
                        and NATO responses. Starting point would be assessment that military
                        intervention in Austria would have gravest immediate consequences. For this
                        phase we would therefore envisage all of above steps, as adapted to Austrian
                        developments, plus shifts in deployments designed to signal Soviets that
                        move into Austria would run serious risk of involvement with forces
                        principal treaty signatories. Assume NATO members would display similar
                        concern and consider related actions.</p>
                    <p>d. In “solid threat” phase serious consideration should also be given to
                        coordinated economic moves among Allies that might serve to deter or at
                        least raise price of Soviet intervention. Economic reaction to be effective
                        would have to involve consideration of terminating “business as usual”
                        philosophy which appears to govern attitude most Allies toward private
                        ventures in this area at present time.</p>
                    <p>3. You should make clear, in outlining above precis contingency planning,
                        that while steps recommended for present phase are from standpoint US, firm
                        and already being implemented, action/suggestions for second stage reflect
                        only preliminary thinking. In time and as our own ideas jell, we will wish
                        to consult actively in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on actual
                        contingency plans.<note n="4" xml:id="d333fn4">At the special session on

                        CZECHOSLOVAKIA</p>
                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>The Czechoslovak crisis has had the effect of stalling the slow proc-ess of
                        disintegration that has beset NATO since the late 1950s. For the first time
                        in several years all the allies (save France) accept the necessity of
                        preserving an effective alliance beyond its 20th anniversary next year.</p>
                    <p>What this will mean in terms of increased individual country contributions to
                        NATO is still unclear. So far the European allies have responded to the
                        events in Czechoslovakia with far more promise than performance. Among the
                        four or five that have pledged concrete new contributions, only Greece has
                        offered anything approximating a clear net gain for the alliance. Belgium,
                        for its part, has offered only to “postpone” impending troop cutbacks in
                        West Germany; Britain has pledged further commitments which represent almost
                        nothing new for the common defense; and West Germany, with most to fear from
                        the Soviets, has refrained from making any substantial gesture that might
                        reinforce charges of German revanchism.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>1. Whatever the initial reaction to the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia, none
                        of the European NATO allies seems to have been sufficiently moved to put
                        aside the frugal attitude toward defense spending or to rush to the support
                        of the“flexible response” strategy, on which the argument for increased
                        conventional forces has been based. This strategy, although officially
                        adopted by NATO last year, continues to be regarded suspiciously as a
                        prelude to US nuclear disengagement. Under current circumstances it is
                        likely to attract even less favor among the European allies, especially
                        since one of its basic tenets—the concept of “political warning
                        time”—appears to have been brought into question. Judging from the rapid
                        airlift of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia, it is no longer certain that
                        NATO would have sufficient lead time—after the first signs of a Soviet
                        build-up—to “rotate” back into Europe the US and British forces earmarked
                        for allied defense. Hence there is little incentive for the <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0809"/>Europeans to add further resources to
                        NATO's conventional arsenal, since in the event of a Soviet attack it might
                        have to be quickly superseded by a resort to nuclear weaponry.</p>
                    <p>2. Against these rather melancholy realities, however, a few encouraging
                        facts may be arrayed. For one thing, the allies are once again talking
                        seriously about strengthening the organization. On the eve of the
                        Czechoslovak crisis, the 15-nation grouping was in a state of disarray.
                        France had pulled its military forces out of the integrated command
                        structure in 1966, thus severing land communications between NATO's northern
                        and southern tiers. More recently Belgium had decided to recall two of its
                        six brigades from West Germany. In the last five years Britain's Army of the
                        Rhine had been reduced from 53,000 to 48,000. The US force in Europe had
                        been cut by 25 percent over the same period. Even the West Germans had been
                        unable to field their 12th division before 1965. Amid this growing
                        confusion, the shock of the Czechoslovak tragedy has galvanized new interest
                        and support for the alliance although not to the degree that some of the
                        allies would prefer.</p>
                    <p>3. Perhaps most importantly, the crisis has led to renewed emphasis on the
                        idea of solidarity. For the first time since the Soviet invasion of Hungary,
                        all 15 NATO allies seem equally sensitive to the threat that has always
                        proved the best catalyst to allied unity. Meeting in special session in
                        early October, they were able to agree on a series of statements, together
                        with action recommendations, underscoring the importance of a common front
                        in the face of the new imponderables in East-West relations. Of particular
                        value was their “political assessment” of the“post-Czechoslovak” situation,
                        which brought into clear focus the arguments needed by some of the member
                        governments (Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands) to
                        justify new defense commitments to their parliaments and to public opinion.
                        The assessment established in unequivocal language (1) that the invasion had
                        demonstrated the unpredictability of Soviet behavior, (2) that it had
                        importantly affected, if not radically changed, the military and security
                        balance in Europe; and (3) that a new strategic threat had been posed by the
                        Soviet build-up in the Mediterranean. With the threat thus identified, the
                        allies should be in a better position to cooperate in checking it.</p>
                    <p>4. As a corollary to the drafting of the NATO “assessment,” the Soviet action
                        has stimulated the entire process of interallied consultation, which has
                        long been a sticking point in relations between the US and the other 14
                        allies. Even the French were able to bring themselves to take part in the
                        deliberations leading to the political and military papers on the situation.
                        In the seven-nation nuclear planning group, moreover, the British and West
                        Germans took a leading role in discussions on strategy and agreed to work
                        together on future strategic guidelines for the alliance. This could lead to
                        greater involvement by the Europeans in an <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0810"/>area of allied concern traditionally monopolized by the
                        US—a development which in turn could make them more responsive to the
                        demands of NATO defense.</p>
                    <p>5. As still another consequence of the Czech crisis, the European allies seem
                        to have been made more conscious of what they must do to preserve the US
                        guarantee on their behalf. The British in particular have begun to talk of
                        creating a European defense grouping in NATO as a means of heading off any
                        further cutbacks in the US presence on the continent. In part this is an
                        effort to enhance Britain's credit as a European power, but it also reflects
                        growing awareness that the European allies must work together to relieve the
                        US of some of its defense burdens.</p>
                    <p>6. Through the work of the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName>
                        committees last year, the alliance tried to identify itself with the
                        movement toward “peaceful engagement” with the East and specifically to
                        develop a common program on mutual troop reductions vis-a-vis the Soviet
                        bloc. Whether or not these efforts would have given new purpose to NATO is,
                        at least for the moment, beside the point. The Soviet actions in Eastern
                        Europe have shifted emphasis back toward the more basic problem of defense.
                        To allies, such as Denmark and Norway, which have insisted that the search
                        for detente be continued, the NATO “political assessment” grants only a
                        conditional mandate. detente should be pursued, it states, only so long as
                        it does not jeopardize allied solidarity.</p>
                    <p>7. Viewed against the high ideals of Atlantic partnership, these alterations
                        in NATO's prospects seem rather minor. They do not prefigure the quantitive
                        improvements in the allied defense system that could steel it against an
                        all-out Soviet assault. But in terms of what is needed to keep the alliance
                        alive for the next few years, they do offer some grounds for optimism. At
                        the very least the alliance is more cohesive than before and the European
                        allies are more aware of their responsibilities under the collective defense
                        concept.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effects of the Czech Crisis</p>
                    <p>This fall's Ministerial Meeting takes place against a background of
                        continuing Allied concern stemming from the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Even
                        though the Allies do not wish to abandon their goals of reducing East-West
                        tensions, and ultimately arriving at a peaceful settlement of the issues
                        dividing Europe, the atmosphere has changed drastically as compared with
                        meetings of the past few years. The fact of the invasion, and the resulting
                        uncertainty regarding Soviet intentions toward Eastern Europe, the
                        Mediterranean and even Western Europe, have combined to produce a new
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>The highwater mark of detente was reached in December 1967 with adoption of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_HPCJM1">Harmel</persName> Report and in June 1968
                        with the Ministerial declaration on mutual force reductions. Today, despite
                        differences of emphasis among individual NATO governments, the accent is on
                        strengthening the Alliance's defenses and its deterrent posture against
                        possible future contingencies.</p>
                    <p>For some of the Alliance members—for example France, Canada and Denmark—the
                        Soviet aggression has deflated exaggerated hopes for early change in the
                        Soviet Union's European policy. (There is no evidence, however, that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has changed his
                        fundamental views on NATO, the United States or Europe. There are some signs
                        of French probing to see whether bilateral US-French defense cooperation,
                        particularly in the nuclear field, might be improved essentially on French
                        terms.) For the US the present situation, which may not last, offers a major
                        opportunity to improve the Alliance's political cohesion and its defense
                        posture.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East-West Discussions in Light of Czechoslovakia</p>
                    <p>The NATO discussions since August have demonstrated that, for the longer
                        term, none of our Allies wishes to forestall essential contacts <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0813"/>or negotiations with the East. Most of them
                        still favor the Non-Proliferation Treaty and would like to see a
                        breakthrough in the arms race in which the two great powers would be
                        committed to accept controls on their own nuclear armaments. On the other
                        hand, however, they are seriously concerned about the psychological and
                        political effects of any early talks in view of the post-Czech
                        situation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other International Issues</p>
                    <p>Even though the European situation will be uppermost in the minds of the NATO
                        delegations, other international issues will also affect the setting for
                        this meeting. The two major questions of the Middle East and Vietnam may
                        figure in Ministerial statements. Anticipation about policies to be followed
                        by the new U.S. Administration will also mark the meeting's atmosphere.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Western European Unification</p>
                    <p>The continued lack of progress in unifying Western Europe will loom large in
                        the corridors. It may also be reflected in statements around the table.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s intransigence in
                        keeping Britain out of the European Community has just manifested itself
                        again in the failure of the recent <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>
                        Ministerial Meeting. Tentative ideas for a European caucus in NATO have also
                        failed to jell into anything offering promise of immediate results. The
                        British will nevertheless continue to take soundings looking toward
                        increased intra-European cooperation in the NATO framework.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Domestic Politics and Youth</p>
                    <p>The domestic political situation in some of the leading Allied countries also
                        remains delicate and complex. This is the case for example in the UK, the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Italy. For Canada, this will be
                        the first Ministerial Meeting since the Trudeau Government's electoral
                        victory.</p>
                    <p>This year's manifestations of radicalism among the youth in various Allied
                        countries continue to affect European attitudes across-the-board. The memory
                        of the near chaos in France last spring is still fresh in everyone's
                        mind.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">International Finance</p>
                    <p>Lastly, even though the gold and monetary crisis of the past winter is well
                        behind us, questions of domestic finance continue to loom large. Their
                        impact on resources that can be made available for Western defense is likely
                        to be the hardest factor conditioning Ministerial deliberations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A NATO Watershed</p>
                    <p>In light of the foregoing, this last NATO Ministerial Meeting of the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration—also the last meeting before
                        the twentieth <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0814"/>anniversary of the
                        Treaty's signature—will represent a watershed in the recent history of the
                        Alliance. The past two years have seen major improvements in NATO's defense
                        and consultation arrangements. Now we would like to see a demonstration of
                        renewed political will on the part of the governments, especially with
                        regard to defense contributions.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. The Meeting: U.S. Objectives and Problems</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Objectives</p>
                    <p>Our broad objectives for this meeting, and for followup work to be done by
                        Permanent Representatives, flow from the political background and are
                        largely conditioned by it. Briefly stated, these are:</p>
                    <p>—To achieve formal Ministerial recognition of the changed situation resulting
                        from the invasion of Czechoslovakia; from the permanent stationing of
                        substantial Warsaw Pact forces in that country; from what is now known of
                        the high state of readiness of these forces; and from the uncertainties
                        created by Soviet actions and doctrine, including national sovereignty and
                        the “Socialist commonwealth”.</p>
                    <p>—To elicit firm commitments from the other Allies regarding qualitative and
                        quantitative improvements in their NATO defense contributions.</p>
                    <p>—To reach a common understanding on the political implications of the
                        post-Czech situation for the future of East-West relations and contacts.</p>
                    <p>—To reiterate as appropriate our support for Western European unification
                        and, specifically, for initiatives the European members of the Alliance may
                        take in the defense field.</p>
                    <p>—To emphasize the need to continue the Alliance for the indefinite future
                        without undertaking new legal commitments that would require action by the
                        Senate.</p>
                    <p>—To stress the continuity of US policy in supporting NATO as well as the
                        concept of collective security inherent in the Organization.</p>
                    <p>—To make clear, without being provocative, Three Power (US, UK, French) and
                        general Allied support for established Western positions on Germany and
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>—To recall our continued deep interest in Mediterranean security as well as
                        to seek, by adequate warnings, to deter possible further Soviet moves that
                        might affect the balance in that area (e.g. Yugoslavia, Romania and
                        Albania).</p>
                    <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0815"/>
                    <p>—To give a clear signal to the Soviet Union of Allied determination to defend
                        the Treaty area, and to make clear that any further Soviet aggressive moves
                        in Eastern Europe would have grave and incalculable consequences and would
                        cause immediate and appropriate Allied reactions in self-defense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Meetings and the Problems</p>
                    <p>The meetings will be attended by ministers of foreign affairs, defense and
                        finance. They will embrace sessions of three different bodies: the Nuclear

                    <p>In the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, the main problem will be to get

                        the European political situation, allied defense, Germany and Berlin, and
                        the“signal” to the East. Much of this work will have been done in advance by
                        the Permanent Representatives in the form of a draft communique and other
                        documents such as the post-Czech political assessment. Discussion of these
                        documents will afford an opportunity for ministers to have a substantive
                        exchange of views on the overall situation. As a related but subsidiary
                        issue, ministers may also be asked to approve a report on civil emergency
                        planning aimed at assuring progress in this field to accompany renewed
                        emphasis on a better NATO defense posture.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Defense Planning Committee</p>
                    <p>In the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> there will probably be some hard
                        bargaining among the Fourteen over various decisions to be taken regarding
                        improvement of the NATO integrated defense system, and particularly the
                        specific increases in defense contributions to be made by individual
                        countries. Here again, much of the groundwork has already been laid by the
                        Permanent Representatives and by the Secretary's October 7 dinner meeting in
                        New York. Nevertheless, the Germans, the Dutch and others have made clear
                        repeatedly that their national decisions must follow from collective NATO
                        decisions. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> decisions may have
                        to be approved in general terms first, with individual national decisions
                        stated in principle or on a contingent basis. The Europeans will also want
                        to know what the United States might do; e.g. hold early deployment
                        exercises, improve combat capability of forces in Europe, and in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>On the financial side, our own concern involves balance of payments
                        considerations as well as increased budgetary resources other governments
                        might make available for defense. Even though our specific negotiations on
                        balance of payments grounds are likely to remain bilateral, we are seeking
                        to have a statement adopted recognizing the common interest in neutralizing
                        foreign exchange losses incurred by contributions for NATO defense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee</p>
                    <p>In addition to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> sessions, defense ministers of all
                        countries except France, Iceland and Luxembourg will meet in the <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss>. The purpose will be to review the work
                        of the NPG in light of that body's discussions in Bonn in October.</p>
                    <p>One possible issue: There may be an attempt on the part of several countries
                        to initiate discussions and studies which lead to a fixed set of
                        consultation rules and procedures governing the use of nuclear weapons. This
                        could result in a complete impasse or development of procedures so
                        inflexible as to be unworkable in any of the myriad unforeseen circumstances
                        which could arise. Either result could seriously degrade NATO's tactical
                        nuclear deterrent. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
                        intends to discourage pressures for such development by reminding the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>s directly of the dangers involved and by
                        expressing deep US concern about the maintenance of the deterrent.<note n="6" xml:id="d335fn6">On November 8, the Assistant Secretary of State

                    <p>Acting President Hellwig apologized for President <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s absence due to long-standing official visits to the
                        associated states. He was delighted to see this reciprocation of his,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>'s and Deniau's visit to
                        Washington. He stressed the importance of regular consultations like this to
                        discuss tough problems which could set the future pattern.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that, after eight years, he wished to share some thoughts
                        about the problems facing the next Administration. The countries of the West
                        had allowed secondary questions to become too important while primary
                        questions were forgotten or had receded into the background. Both sides of
                        the Atlantic were now debating the basic questions of peace and collective
                        security, i.e., to prevent war and organize peace.</p>
                    <p>Isolationist sentiments were increasing on both sides of the Atlantic. This
                        was partially because the world seems in large measure safe and prosperous
                        and many have become lazy. It is partially because of the <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0818"/>heavy burdens borne over so long a period
                        of time. Since 1945 the United States has suffered 350,000 casualties in
                        collective security efforts. This is a heavy price to pay and many Americans
                        now ask whether it should be paid.</p>
                    <p>It was thus necessary to reexamine notions of collective security; perhaps it
                        is possible to find a better solution although he had been unable to find
                        one himself. Otherwise one would come to a worse alternative, isolationism.
                        It was imperative to debate these issues; they had a deadly importance. It
                        was possible for all of us to draw the lessons from World War II; we will
                        not have the luxury after World War III.</p>
                    <p>For the first time since 1945 what Europeans do will affect the way the
                        American people react to problems. We have been paid the highest compliment
                        by many in the world that the United States can always be relied upon.
                        However, what others do will have a major effect on us.</p>
                    <p>In NATO, one asks how NATO can be strengthened after Czechoslovakia; what the
                        Europeans decide to do will largely dictate what the U.S. does. Europe is in
                        the presence of a miracle that it may not understand. The U.S. has 650,000
                        men in Southeast Asia but continues to maintain its forces in Europe. There
                        is already considerable pressure in Congress to eliminate these forces and
                        any U.S. Administration must be able to say that NATO friends take the
                        issues seriously and that we are working together in comradely common effort
                        where each pulls his own weight. If the Mansfield resolution had been voted
                        by the Senate in June, it would have had a majority. The Soviets saved us;
                        this pressure has been postponed but probably not indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary's one major regret was that the disarray in the Communist
                        world, so obvious in China, the USSR, and in the far-reaching liberalizing
                        tendencies in Czechoslovakia, was matched by our own disarray. If the West
                        had been moving dynamically to a position of strength in terms of European
                        unity and North Atlantic cohesion, with unity as a common purpose, the
                        security threat from the Communist world would have been substantially
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>But now there was no movement toward European unity or to the expansion of
                        membership in the Common Market.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated he could not speak for the new Administration, but he
                        felt that Atlantic solidarity and support for NATO were not matters for
                        anxiety. The Republican Party is committed to cohesion in the Western world
                        and critical of disarray. The new cabinet will probably have been designated
                        in early December and it would be easier at that time to make judgments on
                        specific issues.</p>
                    <p>While he could not speak authoritatively on future trade policy either, it
                        was predictable that protectionist forces would make a major effort. They
                        have been largely fended off over the past year because of the President's
                        firmly held views and with help from key committees in the <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0819"/>Congress. Historically, however, there has
                        been a tendency for protectionists to be bolder under Republican than under
                        Democratic Administrations. There are many understanding Republicans who
                        appreciate the importance of this and he hoped that their influence would be
                        decisive in a new Administration. He cited the proposed “arrangement” with
                        the U.K., however, as an example of what would strengthen protectionist
                        sentiment in the U.S. (See separate Memcon)<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">In
                            this 2-page memorandum of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told the Commission officials that the United
                            States was concerned about French-German proposals to expand trade
                            preferences by some kind of special relationship with the Common Market
                            since they would discriminate against the United States and would not
                            include political moves to strengthen the Community. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p> Hellwig agreed that we concentrated too much on detail; it was critical to
                        develop a new basic political approach to European unity. The nightmarish
                        consequences of a failure to do so had been dramatically highlighted by
                        Czechoslovakia. Conflicts in the past had been largely intra-European, now
                        the possibility of conflict was largely between the US and the USSR; the
                        Community's role, primarily on Franco-German rapprochement. NATO remained
                        the basis for our collective security effort, but this caused a problem with
                        the neutrals. Europeans appreciated U.S. sensitivity in accepting commercial
                        discrimination in order to help achieve European unity. Even economically it
                        was possible to make a contribution to world peace through increasing trade
                        liberalization, e.g., such great moves as the Kennedy Round. Protectionism,
                        however, was not an exclusively American phenomenon. The pressures were
                        strong in Europe as well. The Community recognizes the effects of
                        integration on third countries. The Community can not be protectionist and
                        must follow an open and liberal policy wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Colonna agreed that U.S.-European cooperation over the past
                        decade had come to be taken for granted. We must now fight to maintain this
                        cooperation, but it was difficult when one side was so much stronger than
                        the other. The weakness was more political than economic. One could take
                        pride in the achievements of the Kennedy Round. While this was not difficult
                        for Germany and Benelux, protectionism in France and Italy was basically a
                        manifestation of their economic weakness. They did not have the benefits of
                        a continental market governed by a federal constitution. Thus both economic
                        and political unity take time. While the U.S. had a right to be impatient,
                        no responsible European could ignore the importance of these domestic
                        problems. But it was necessary to understand each other's difficulties
                        rather than to throw these difficulties into each other's face.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Barre noted that Europeans tend perhaps to rely too much upon
                        U.S. for protection without clearly understanding their own
                        responsibilities. Neither the U.S. nor Europe could confront the world of
                            <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0820"/>the future if they were not
                        closely linked in friendly cooperation. The Europeans themselves must make
                        more of an effort to strengthen links among themselves so that they could in
                        turn strengthen trans-Atlantic links.</p>
                    <p>But history and tradition weighed heavily in Europe and the problems of
                        linking large and small countries in Western Europe could not be carried out
                        except by recognizing complex realities. It was difficult, he confessed, to
                        build Europe with Europeans. It was particularly difficult to do this with
                        European diplomatic services which still relied upon 17th and 18th century
                        techniques and conceptions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that, 23 years after the war, the great creative period
                        in the West was past. Half the population was now too young to remember the
                        stimulus of the war and was not gripped with the problems as had been the
                        older generation. This involved the problem of rededication; either
                        confirming old policies or finding new ones. He could not see the shape of
                        better policies but he feared the possibilities of more disastrous ones.</p>
                    <p>Vice President Hellwig also noted the problem of the young generation. He did
                        not think that they accepted the same premises as the older generation and
                        it was up to Europe to work out ways and means of engaging youth in these
                        new endeavors.</p>

                    <p>5845. Secto 43. Subject: Wrap-up of NATO Ministerial Meeting, November
                        14–16.</p>
                    <p>1. Against the background of continuing Allied concern following the invasion
                        of Czechoslovakia, the NATO partners met in Brussels a month early this year
                        to underscore by word and deed their reaction to the Soviet aggression.
                        Their response has been positive and constructive. The Allies have formally
                        recognized the changed security situation in <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0821"/>Europe and most key members of the Alliance have pledged
                        their determination to spend more money to improve their military forces. It
                        is politically significant that the constant trend toward reduction of
                        military expenditures by the European allies has been certainly stemmed and
                        hopefully reversed. The military side of the Alliance was given needed
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>2. All Fifteen Allies—including France—showed unexpected cohesion on the key
                        political issues. The Ministers approved a clear but non-provocative signal
                        to the Soviets that any further adventures in intervention would “create an
                        international crisis with grave consequences”. While agreeing that detente
                        remains a long-term goal of NATO policy, the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> indicated sober realization that today's accent is on
                        military preparedness.</p>
                    <p>3. The French have been reasonably constructive throughout in contrast to the
                        Canadians. The Berlin and Germany section of the communique<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2">For text of the final communique, see Department of
                            State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 9, 1968, pp.
                            595–597.</note> prepared by the Bonn group was approved swiftly at the
                        quadripartite dinner. The major issue of stating the determination of the
                        members to continue the Alliance was dealt with responsibly by the French
                        who added a concurring opinion to the otherwise agreed formula. The French
                        exhibited a clear appreciation of the significance of Soviet actions as they
                        affect the security situation in Europe. Beyond the specific French action
                        the manner in which Debre handled himself impressed many delegations. There
                        was a marked change in the manner of French performance, which seemed to us
                        more than merely a difference in personality between Debre and <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. The meeting provided opportunity for the Secretary to have bilateral
                        meetings with such key figures as <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>, Debre, <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>, Caglayangil and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Brosio</persName>. In addition to the specifics facing the Ministers,
                        the Secretary was able to discuss in some depth the prospects for Europe in
                        the post-Czechoslovakia period and how the Alliance should face the future.
                        As usual Berlin and Germany received close and sympathetic attention, the
                        Secretary stressing the importance of maintaining the viability of
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>5. The session was opened by an <gloss target="#t_NDAC1">NDAC</gloss> meeting
                        which went well. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
                        picked up where he left off at the Bonn NPG meeting in bringing his fellow
                        Ministers along toward greater understanding of the nuclear problem in the
                        defense of Europe. The serious and sober consideration of this subject
                        revealed that Ministers have acquired a better appreciation of the terribly
                        difficult decisions involved in this whole <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0822"/>area, a point the Secretary of State noted in his <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> presentation. Several Ministers emphasized
                        the value they attached to this activity.</p>
                    <p>6. The balance of payments problem received more high level attention than at
                        other Ministerial meetings. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> personally intervened, an historic first for a NATO
                        Finance Minister in the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> discussion with
                        a forthright explanation of the complicated and critical nature of the
                        Alliance's financial problem: Ministers showed understanding but were
                        reluctant to make specific commitments. The general reaction, however, was
                        such that we now have a basis for seeking more serious consideration of this
                        subject in capitals than has been the case previously. The communique
                        paragraph dealing with this matter has proved to be one of the more
                        difficult to draft in acceptable language.</p>
                    <p>7. Public reaction to the Ministerial Meeting has been, on the whole,
                        positive. Coincidental public meeting of North Atlantic Assembly had effect
                        of bringing prominently to attention of press much of subject matter and
                        considerations which also before Ministerial Meeting. Allowing for fact that
                        Parliamentarians present are generally Alliance supporters, the
                        recommendations they generated provided helpful backdrop of Parliamentary
                        expressions. Assembly recommendations recognizing need for overcoming
                        military deficiencies, resolving military balance of payments and signaling
                        NATO concern to Soviets were especially helpful in this regard.
                        Recommendations represented undertaking by those Parliamentarians, moreover,
                        to help translate Assembly's sentiments into national actions.</p>
                    <p>8. The specific contributions from members (reported separately) revealed
                        growing awareness by European leaders that they must expand their
                        contributions in sharing burden of collective defense. The unique November
                        Ministerial Meeting has capped our efforts to carry out the scenario
                        developed in response to the President's directive last September.<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">See <ref target="#d324">Document
                            324</ref>.</note> The spade work done by Ambassadors in the various
                        capitals, by <gloss target="#t_USNATO1">USNATO</gloss> and the informal

                        While this Ministerial Meeting has not yet by any means solved NATO's
                        problems, we can take encouragement from the fact that the European allies
                        have indicated by their actions that they recognize what must be done and
                        more importantly, they seem willing to make the sacrifices necessary to
                        preserve the common security. As a result of this meeting we have a base
                        from which to move forward towards greater European efforts in their own
                        defense.</p>

                    <p>The NATO Ministerial Council agreed at Brussels in November on new defense
                        measures and noted the creation of a NATO air surveillance command for
                        operation in the Mediterranean. This paper recounts Moscow's reaction to
                        these measures, and to reports from Brussels that the Council had also
                        discussed NATO's security interest in states adjacent to the USSR.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Abstract</p>
                    <p>The November 15–16 meeting of the NATO Ministerial Council in Brussels
                        produced developments in three areas which could hardly have been welcome to
                        Moscow. The participants agreed on increased national contributions to the
                        Alliance's defense forces; they welcomed the new NATO air surveillance
                        command organized for Mediterranean operation; and reports from the meeting
                        indicated that NATO's security concerns might extend beyond its membership,
                        to states on the USSR's periphery. Soviet reaction to these Brussels
                        discussions has thus far been relatively limited at least in the propaganda
                        realm. TASS did issue an “authorized” statement on the Brussels session on
                        November 23 (the first such TASS statement on a Council meeting since
                        December 1958 when NATO extended a guarantee to Berlin), and Soviet
                        diplomats delivered a series of oral demarches about the air surveillance
                        command in a variety of NATO capitals. On the whole, however, the Kremlin
                        has remained generally reticent, in part perhaps to avoid giving the NATO
                        members more cause for concern about Soviet intentions. More pertinently,
                        however, the Soviet leaders may themselves be undecided as to the actual
                        significance of the Brussels decisions and are still debating about suitable
                        policy lines for the situation brought on by their invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>Their reactions to date suggest there is a preliminary and provisional Soviet
                        assessment that the new attitude on defense issues in Western Europe is a
                        manageable problem for the moment, even though it is an undesirable
                        development. Moscow probably calculates it still has scope for maneuver
                        here, and time for bringing its propaganda apparatus (overt and covert) to
                        bear within the individual NATO states to limit, or <pb n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0824"/>dilute, the measures agreed upon at
                        Brussels. The NATO Mediterranean air command, in contrast, poses an
                        immediate challenge to Soviet interests and one which would have to be met
                        immediately if the USSR is to safeguard the political principles on which it
                        seems to be developing its Mediterranean role. The “grey area” of NATO
                        security interest is probably evaluated in the Kremlin as an even more
                        serious potential problem, but a less tangible one, and therefore less
                        amenable to concrete countermeasures. Moscow has carefully given no hint as
                        to how it expects to cope with this latter issue; it only insists that the
                        states mentioned in connection with a “NATO umbrella” are all disassociating
                        themselves from this “unwanted” concern with their affairs.</p>
                    <p>Only in the case of the Mediterranean air surveillance unit has the USSR
                        resorted to formal action. The Soviet ambassadors in Athens, Ankara, Rome,
                        London and Washington delivered oral demarches (November 18–19), castigating
                        the new unit as a “premeditated and flagrant violation of international
                        standards governing the freedom of navigation in the open seas.” But while
                        decrying the new NATO creation, Moscow also utilized the demarche to
                        register in diplomatic channels for the first time its own claims to be, and
                        to be acknowledged as, a Mediterranean power. (The thesis that as a Black
                        Sea power the USSR is “therefore” a Mediterranean power was first enunciated
                        by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in May 1968; Soviet media
                        began stressing the point only in November.) Moscow's major concern at the
                        moment seems to be to put on record—and have it accepted
                        internationally—that the Soviet naval presence in the Mediterranean is a
                        vital element of the USSR's global defense posture and that Soviet ships
                        will remain there regardless of what NATO does. But since the number of
                        Soviet ships operating in the Mediterranean has declined somewhat in the
                        past two months from the levels reached with the Arab-Israeli war, it also
                        seems that the USSR intends to avoid any undue exacerbation of tension in
                        the area while it attempts to register its point of principle.</p>
                    <p>In delivering their various demarches, some of the Soviet ambassadors
                        reportedly also raised the idea of a possible conference of Mediterranean
                        powers to deal with the problems of that area. It still is not clear whether
                        these hints were merely interpolations by the diplomats themselves or
                        whether they were intended to presage a serious initiative. Moscow must be
                        aware that the prospects for getting agreement from the interested powers
                        for such a conference seem hardly promising, let alone realistic, at this
                        point. The Soviets may, however, be contemplating some future initiative
                        with their old “sea of peace” ideas and might feel mere negotiations about a
                        conference on the topic could prove useful, even if no conference ever
                        materializes.</p>

                    <p>290321. Subject: Possible Spanish Relationship with NATO.</p>
                    <p>1. Since 1953 the Spanish Government has indicated to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> varying degrees of interest in some form of
                        association with, if not membership in, NATO. We recall the sharp Spanish
                        reaction at the lack of consultation at the time COMIBERLANT was
                        established. The <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> pointed out that the
                        Spanish Atlantic Coast was included in the IBERLANT area and thus Spain had
                        a legitimate interest in participating in the defense of the area.</p>
                    <p>2. As recently as mid-November of this year, during Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s visit to Madrid, the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> reminded us of its desire to participate in
                        the defense planning for the Spanish Atlantic area and the Mediterranean in
                        coordination with the U.S. and other Western European countries. Spain also
                        would wish to participate in the decision making process in defense matters
                        pertinent to its area of concern.</p>
                    <p>3. We realize that a number of NATO members are ideologically hostile to the
                        current Spanish regime. We also recognize that the British Government is
                        troubled by Spanish claims to Gibraltar. Nevertheless, there are other NATO
                        Allies who believe that Spain, by virtue of geography alone, is a valuable
                        potential contributor to an enhanced NATO defense posture in the Atlantic
                        and Mediterranean. The mutual benefits of such a contribution are
                        increasingly apparent in light of growing Soviet Military presence and
                        political activities in those regions. For example, Spanish naval forces in
                        the Mediterranean and Atlantic could cooperate with NATO forces through
                        surveillance and intelligence exchange, coordinated planning, and combined
                        exercises, thereby enhancing Western capabilities in the area. In the longer
                        term, NATO could benefit from Spain's air defense capabilities in the same
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>4. For these reasons we are giving consideration to finding means by which a
                        suitable Spanish relationship with NATO could be established. In light of
                        particular British interests in this question, we wish to discuss the matter
                        with the U.K. and seek its views and possible support before developing a
                        final position. If the U.K. would be prepared to agree to a suitable
                        Spanish/NATO tie, we believe that political objections on the part of other
                        NATO Allies could be overcome. Therefore, you are <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0826"/>requested to approach the FonOff at a
                        suitably high level along the following lines:</p>
                    <p>A. You should draw on the foregoing to explain the purpose of and the
                        rationale behind our approach.</p>
                    <p>B. You should outline the following possible means of effecting a Spanish tie
                        with NATO. We believe that these proposals would involve neither an
                        amendment of the treaty nor action by Parliaments.</p>
                    <p>1. Political relationships could involve establishing a liaison channel
                        between the Secretary General and an agent of the Spanish Government
                        (presumably the Spanish Ambassador in Brussels). Spanish concerns and
                        interests could thus be conveyed to the Alliance and Alliance views and
                        concerns to the Spaniards. Another means would be the establishment of a
                        “Spanish Group” within NATO along the lines of existing open-ended Malta
                        Group. Thus those countries with interests in the Mediterranean, for
                        example, could meet on a regular basis or as needed with a Spanish
                        representative. Since Spanish interest is based on defense considerations,
                        this group might operate under the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. This
                        aegis would stress the defense aspect of the relationship. Such a group
                        could also be limited to littoral powers or those militarily active in the
                        Mediterranean. This restricted group would have the effect of emphasizing
                        Spanish interest in and potential contribution to the mutual defense
                        position in the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>2. Either in conjunction with the political relationship outlined in B.1
                        above or in the absence of such a relationship, Spanish liaison with NATO
                        military organs might be established. In this area there are a variety of
                        possibilities that could include a liaison mission to the Military Committee
                        in Brussels. Consideration in the <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> of
                        Mediterranean or IBERLANT issues could thus take place in the presence of a
                        Spanish liaison officer. This arrangement would permit effective
                        coordination of defense planning while allowing the Spanish to present views
                        or military issues concerning their areas of interest. Similarily, Spanish
                        liaison missions could be accredited to <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, AFSOUTH and IBERLANT (and possibly <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> as the superior command for
                        IBERLANT). Spanish relationship under such an arrangement would be removed
                        from the conspicuous arena of NATO Headquarters and permit regional defense
                        planning in a more apolitical environment.</p>
                    <p>C. In your presentation you should stress the practical value of the military
                        relationship outlined in B.2 above. You should make the point that Spain can
                        contribute to the achievement of NATO defense objectives in the
                        Mediterranean and IBERLANT areas and that such arrangements would not
                        necessarily imply approval of the present Spanish regime.</p>
                    <p>D. You should urge favorable consideration by the U.K. of the principle of a
                        limited Spanish relationship with NATO. You should also state that we would
                        welcome British support for this concept within NATO.</p>
                    <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0827"/>
                    <p>E. If in your judgment our purposes would be served by noting relationship of
                        this suggestion to current US-Spanish base negotiations, you may wish to say
                        that a Spanish association with NATO could favorably affect the outcome of
                        the base negotiations. In this connection, you should point out that US
                        facilities in Spain serve NATO as well as US interests, e.g., Spain is home
                        base for US Strike wing assigned to southern flank, communications links
                        important to NATO are located in Spain, and the use of the naval base at
                        Rota helps maintain the nuclear deterrent in the Eastern Atlantic. In
                        addition, US bases in Spain play an important role in US ability to react
                        swiftly to Mediterranean area contingencies.</p>
                    <p>5. U.K. reactions to the approach should be reported fully with information
                        copies to addressees of this message.</p>
