                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations </hi>series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government <pb facs="0005" n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV"/> agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1981–1989 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Reagan Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Reagan Library include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Reagan Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <pb facs="0006" n="V" xml:id="pg_V"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always able to
                    determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached to the
                    paper copy of the document in the Reagan Library file. In such cases, some
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated
                    this ambiguity by stating that the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to time in Washington, DC.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the original document are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and
                    a list of abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each
                    volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as
                        <gloss target="#t_Secto_1">Secto</gloss>) is printed at the start of the
                    text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important docu<pb facs="0007" n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"
                    />ments and policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy
                    advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2014 and was completed in
                    2016, resulted in the decision to withhold 1 document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 4 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 13 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here

                <p>The compilations included in this volume illustrate the formulation of U.S.
                    policy toward seven distinct global issues: law of the sea, human rights,
                    African famine, <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, international population
                    policy, whaling, and the ozone layer. The compilation on the Law of the Sea
                    treaty examines the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s decision not to sign the United Nations Convention on the Law
                    of the Sea and the subsequent <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>
                    mission and reciprocating states agreements. The compilation on human rights
                    looks at general, rather than bilateral, human rights issues with one exception:
                    U.S.-Soviet human rights negotiations are presented in detail, as they were the
                    major focus of the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs in the
                    Department of State. The compilation on the famine in Africa delineates the
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s response to
                    African and Third World hunger from a thematic and regional perspective rather
                    than examining feeding efforts in individual countries. The compilation on
                        <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> looks at how policymakers used
                    foreign policy in response to a frightening epidemic, from immigration and visa
                    issues to the Soviet disinformation campaign on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                        >AIDS</gloss>. The population compilation examines the <persName
                        corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s decisions regarding
                    funding population programs in other countries, with an emphasis on the United
                    Nations International Conference on Population (<gloss target="#t_ICP_1"
                        >ICP</gloss>) in 1984. The whaling compilation decribes efforts to manage
                    the 1982 ban on commercial whaling enacted by the International Whaling
                    Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) in 1982, which affected
                    relations among the United States and Norway, Iceland, Japan, and the Soviet
                    Union. The compilation on ozone looks mainly at the negotiation of the Vienna
                    Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on
                    Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer rather than examining all international
                    air pollution issues, such as the U.S.-Canadian consultations on acid rain,
                    which will be discussed in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1981–1988,
                    Volume VII, Western Europe, <pb facs="0011" n="X" xml:id="pg_X"/> 1981–1984 and

                <p>Throughout <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s term in office, there
                    was considerable tension between the Department of State and the White House on
                    foreign policy matters. This tension was the most visible during the debate over
                    what is now considered the “Mexico City Policy,” which placed restrictions on
                    U.S. foreign assistance to non-governmental organizations and some states that
                    performed or supported abortion services. In 1984, shortly before the <gloss
                        target="#t_ICP_1">ICP</gloss> conference which took place in Mexico City,
                    the Department of State, the Agency for International Development, the National
                    Security Council, and the White House staff each circulated plans that aimed to
                    redefine U.S. population policy. After intense bureaucratic infighting, the
                    details of these plans were leaked to the press, the bulk of the White House’s
                    plan became policy, and <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Richard
                    Benedick</persName>, the Department’s Coordinator for Population Activities,
                    requested reassignment.</p>
                <p>The tension between the White House and the Department is, in fact, a theme of
                    many of the compilations in this volume. Counselor to the President (1981–1984)
                    and Attorney General (1985–1989) <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Edwin
                        Meese</persName> was the prime mover in an effort to keep the United States
                    and other Western nations from signing the Law of the Sea treaty, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> opposed the Department when he pressed
                    for stringent testing requirements for immigrants at the height of the <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> epidemic. Although <persName
                        corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> is best known for his input on domestic
                    issues, this volume will show that he played an important role in the creation
                    of foreign policy, particularly when international problems with domestic
                    ramifications arose.</p>
                <p>This volume highlights the contributions of several key policymakers. <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName>, perhaps best known for his
                    involvement in Latin American issues, served as Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs during <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                        >Reagan</persName>’s first term in office and was key to the salvation of
                    human rights policy during Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Haig</persName>’s tenure. <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> and
                    Director of Policy Planning <persName corresp="#p_WP_1">Paul
                        Wolfowitz</persName> each sent memos that laid the foundation for the
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s approach to
                    human rights. <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> also helped to
                    initiate the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s
                    concern for Soviet Jews, which became a central feature of U.S.-Soviet dialogue
                    during <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s second term. The
                    aforementioned <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Richard Benedick</persName> also
                    helped to negotiate much of the Department’s ozone policy and was a strong
                    advocate for a treaty which banned the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, a
                    goal which was eventually realized with the ratification of the Montreal
                    Protocol. <persName corresp="#p_MMP_1">M. Peter McPherson</persName>, the
                    Administrator for the Agency for International Development, played a central
                    role in several policy discussions involving global issues. <persName
                        corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName> fought to be the point of <pb
                        facs="0012" n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI"/> contact during the famine in the Horn of
                    Africa, and his actions following the International Conference on Population
                    helped to cement the Mexico City Policy.</p>
                <p>Overall, the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s
                    record toward public health and the environment was complicated, and
                    contradictory impulses existed throughout the bureaucracy. Although the
                    Department of State advocated for an international ban on whaling in 1982,
                    Department officials also allowed Icelandic officials to conduct scientific
                    whaling expeditions and negotiated with the Department of Commerce so that
                    Iceland would avoid sanctions under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                        >Pelly</persName> Amendment. The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                        >Reagan</persName> administration’s international response to the <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> epidemic originated from the bottom-up, when
                    Foreign Service officers expressed concern about the virus at a conference in
                    1983. It was not until <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s second
                    term when policymakers outside of the Department, National Institutes of Health
                        (<gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>), and Centers for Disease Control
                        (<gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>) began to focus on the global
                    dimensions of the crisis. On the other hand, the administration’s generally
                    positive response to the Vienna and Montreal Protocols may surprise some
                    environmentalists.</p>
                <p>Finally, the breadth of some of these global issues required an astonishing level
                    of interagency coordination. The decision not to sign the Law of the Sea Treaty
                    required a year and a half of cooperation, or at the very least, resignation,
                    from the National Security Council; the Departments of State, Commerce, Defense,
                    and the Interior; the White House staff; and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    Responding to the African famine proved even more complex, as numerous
                    presidentially mandated studies, interagency groups, and agency turf battles
                    made ameliorating the catastrophe a very difficult affair. There were no simple
                    answers to the global problems of the 1980s, and it is unsurprising that the
                    dialogue surrounding these problems was complex as well. This volume illuminates
                    the bureaucratic maelstrom from which policy emerged.</p>

                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>The following more or less random thoughts on some of the procedural and
                            substantive problems you will face as Secretary of State are drawn from
                            over 20 years experience with the fudge factory, 2 transitions, and
                            almost four years as an Ambassador to a middle-sized post. As you will
                            note, I list more problems than answers.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are discussions not related to human rights.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Human Rights</p>
                        <p>I spent 3½ years keeping Pat Derian out of Belgrade, so my prejudices are
                            clear. But with all of that, a nuanced human rights policy that is kept
                            in perspective is a major weapon against the Soviets, a sometime
                            effective tool with erstwhile friends, and a bow in the direction of the
                            left in this country.</p>
                        <p>The Carter Administration handled the issue badly, but you ought not
                            throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
                        <p>One warning: if you turn human rights questions over totally to the
                            bureaus, you will soon find that they will be handled with even less
                            consistency than in the recent past.</p>

                        <p>2. Introduction/Overview: The 1981 Session of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Human Rights Commission affords several excellent
                            opportunities to advance U.S. interests, strengthen cooperation with our
                            allies, increase the West’s overall ability to promote human rights
                            objectives, and contribute to the development of more effective
                            multilateral human rights institutions. As the session starts only two
                            weeks after the new U.S. administration takes office, the positions and
                            tactics of the U.S. inevitably will be interpreted by other governments
                            as constituting the human rights policies of the new administration.</p>
                        <p>3. As the Commission is expected to devote considerable attention to ways
                            of strengthening United Nations human rights machinery and procedures,
                            the session provides an opportunity to achieve significant advances in
                            the multilateralization of efforts to implement universal human rights
                            standards. Success in this institution-building effort would assure more
                            even-handed and less-politicized treatment of human rights issues in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, facilitating the ability of the
                            U.S. to advance its interests without bilateral confrontation. Subjects

                            an appropriate inter-sessional role for the Human Rights Commission,
                            strengthening and expanding the mandate of the new working group on
                            disappearances, study of a possible universal trust fund for victims of
                            human rights violations, and an international convention to forbid
                            torture and to obligate states to extradite or prosecute torturers. The
                            session also affords an opportunity to carry forward efforts to involve
                            the Commission in a meaningful way on behalf of <persName

                            dissidents. The Commission will also deal with an increasingly diverse
                            range of regional and country situations under its public and
                            confidential procedures. Other states will be looking for signals as to
                            any new U.S. posture toward such countries as the <gloss

                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>4. As progress in all of these areas serves U.S. and Western interests,
                            we should be prepared to work closely with other Western members to
                            develop and promote concrete proposals. While we may not wish to take
                            the lead in tabling resolutions and seeking co-sponsors, we should be
                            prepared to play a vigorous supporting role. Working-level officers of

                            and the Assembly have considered the subject intermittently since 1965,
                            the Assembly’s renewed mandate to the Commission provides a fresh
                            opportunity to advance the achievement of this long-sought U.S. and
                            Western goal. Establishment of the post of High Commissioner would bring
                            greater impartiality, coordination, and year-round continuity to <gloss

                                xml:id="pg_115"/> rights activities. We believe the terms of
                            reference for a High Commissioner should strike a balance between his
                            independence and power of initiative to engage in direct contacts, on
                            the one hand, and periodic policy supervision of his activities by an
                            “intergovernmental oversight committee” (which could be the Human Rights
                            Commission itself). Support for the concept of a High Commissioner has
                            grown steadily over the years, and a balanced approach of the type just
                            described could command sufficient support to gain final approval.</p>

                            resolutions this year requesting the Human Rights Commission to develop
                            means to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s

                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> organs now rely mainly on information
                            supplied by governments and non-governmental organizations, and the
                            feeling has grown that a broader, more systematically-collected data
                            base would contribute to greater objectivity and even-handedness in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> deliberations and decisions on
                            reported violations. Sub-Commission Resolution 19 (XXXIII) recommends
                            the establishment of a new information-gathering service within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Human Rights Division.
                            Sub-Commission Resolution 22 (XXXIII) envisages onsite observation
                            visits by Sub-Commissioners. Western countries agree on the need for

                            procedures, although as far as we can determine they have so far devoted
                            little concentrated attention to specific proposals. The terms of
                            reference of a High Commissioner for Human Rights would probably include
                            at least a limited fact-finding role.</p>
                        <p>7. Intersessional Role of the Human Rights Commission: Perceiving a need
                            for improved year-round attention to human rights issues, the Commission
                            at its 1980 session decided to explore a possible intersessional role
                            for its five-member bureau and a mechanism for convening emergency
                            sessions of the full 43-member Commission. The U.S. and other Western
                            countries supported this move as a modest but logical next step in the
                            evolution of effective international human rights machinery which would
                            partially cover the lengthy gaps between the annual sessions of the
                            Commission, the General Assembly, <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss>, and the Sub-Commission.<note n="7" xml:id="d39fn7"
                                >See <ref target="#d39fn3">footnote 3</ref>, above.</note>
                            Bi-monthly or quarterly meetings of the bureau would provide a simple,
                            relatively inexpensive method for assuring prompt intergovernmental
                            attention to urgent situations of massive human rights abuse arising
                            when the main <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> organs are <pb
                                facs="0162" n="116" xml:id="pg_116"/> not in session. Such meetings
                            could also provide a forum for interim Commission monitoring of the
                            activities of a High Commissioner for Human Rights. Emergency sessions
                            of the full Commission might be warranted under very exceptional
                            circumstances, although criteria should be carefully drawn to prevent
                            over-use of this procedure. Organizing and conducting special sessions
                            would obviously be cumbersome and expensive if governments followed the
                            pattern of sending delegates from capitals. A simpler and less-expensive
                            alternative would be institutionalized meetings of Permanent
                            Representatives assigned to Geneva. (Bi-monthly or quarterly meetings of
                            Permanent Representatives might also be a feasible alternative to the
                            proposal for interim meetings of the bureau.) We should prepare concrete
                            proposals for early discussion within the Western group.</p>
                        <p>8. Disappearances: With strong Western backing, the Human Rights
                            Commission at its 1980 session established for one year a five-member
                            working group to begin to deal with the problem of “disappearances”
                            (officially-sanctioned political abductions) on a worldwide basis.<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d39fn8">See <ref target="#d39fn3">footnote 3</ref>,
                                above.</note> The Working Group has held three sessions and will
                            present its report to the Commission in February. (Ref B describes the
                            group’s most recent session.) Creation of the group was a major U.S. and
                            Western objective at the 1980 session, and has generally been regarded
                            as the major achievement of that session. As the development of
                            increasingly effective international machinery can help to
                            multilateralize efforts to solve this tragic problem, we should join
                            other Western countries in pressing energetically for extension of the
                            Working Group’s mandate. The Sub-Commission adopted a resolution this
                            summer urging the Commission to take this action, and the General
                            Assembly adopted a similar resolution by consensus. As the number of new
                            disappearances declined significantly after the establishment of the
                            Working Group, many Western observers believe the very fact of the
                            group’s existence has helped to curb the practice. We would hope that
                            the Commission would agree to extend the Working Group’s mandate without
                            a fixed cutoff date or, alternatively, for a multi-year period. France
                            is likely to take the lead on this issue, as it did at the 1980
                                session.<note n="9" xml:id="d39fn9">In telegram 57570 to Vienna,

                        <p>9. Mass Exoduses: The Human Rights Commission’s 1980 Resolution (30
                            (XXXVI)) requested the Secretary-General “to consider establishing
                            direct contacts with appropriate governments, to assess the relationship
                            between (the mass exodus) and full enjoyment of human rights, and to
                            make concrete recommendations for ameliorating such situations.” To
                            date, however, the Secretary-General has not implemented the resolution.
                            In December, the General Assembly adopted a brief resolution endorsing
                            the Commission resolution. As mass exoduses of refugees have widespread
                            direct implications for the United States, it is in our interest to
                            support continuing efforts to involve the Secretary-General in
                            activities envisaged by the Commission’s 1980 resolution. At the 1981
                            session, we might want to focus on designing an automatic mechanism for
                            triggering implementation of the existing resolution. We will want to
                            consult closely on this subject with the Canadians, who sponsored the
                            1980 Commission resolution and the recent <gloss target="#t_GA_1"
                                >GA</gloss> resolution, and are likely to take the lead again in
                            1981. We will also want to consult with the West Germans, in the light
                            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>’s strong interest in this
                            subject and their recent successful initiative at the General Assembly
                            (refs C and E).</p>
                        <p>10. Trust Fund: The recent General Assembly requested the Commission to
                            study the possibility of converting the trust fund for Chilean victims
                            of human rights abuse to a universal trust fund, and to develop criteria
                            for the administration of such a fund.<note n="10" xml:id="d39fn10">See

                            and all Western countries supported the Assembly resolution.
                            Universalizing the trust fund would be consistent with our goal of
                            promoting even-handedness by <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            institutions and avoiding the proliferation of one-country trust funds.
                            Denmark will take the lead on this item at the Commission.</p>
                        <p>11. Draft Convention Against Torture: Under negotiation since 1978, a
                            Working Group of the Commission has adopted many of the substantive
                            Articles of the Convention, including the difficult definition of
                            torture. Two significant issues remain: a) whether to include in the
                            convention a requirement upon parties to extradite or prosecute alleged
                            torturers (similar to the requirements contained in such conventions as
                            those designed to prevent hijacking and the taking of hostages), and b)
                            the implementation articles, especially the issue of whether the Human
                            Rights Committee of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or some
                            other entity should be charged with responsibility for implementation.
                            The recent meeting of a Western ad hoc group at the Council of Europe
                            (ref D) revealed divergences of view on these matters. However, a
                            completed torture convention would be a useful step in multilateralizing
                            yet another human rights issue and putting international <pb facs="0164"
                                n="118" xml:id="pg_118"/> pressure on states to stop this heinous
                            activity. The U.S. should push strongly for an air-tight “extradite or
                            prosecute” provision and for use of the Human Rights Committee (or,
                            preferably, a Sub-Committee chosen from among those states on the Human
                            Rights Committee which are parties to the Torture Convention) as an
                            implementing body. While the U.S. need not be in the forefront of these
                            negotiations, we should ensure that any resulting convention is
                            meaningful and does not, by implication or otherwise, weaken the
                            “extradite or prosecute” obligation in other conventions.</p>

                            arbitrary deprivation of liberty and calling upon the authorities to
                            release him. Such a telegram could include a similar expression of
                            concern for other named dissidents subjected to arbitrary imprisonment
                            or exile. Our Western allies will support strong action by the
                            Commission. Success, however, will require a major lobbying effort with
                            selected Third World delegations and probably approaches in their
                            capitals.</p>
                        <p>13. Regional and Country Issues (Public Agenda Items):</p>
                        <p>—Middle East: We can expect to see the traditional attacks against
                            Israel, with particular regard to human rights practices in the occupied
                            territories, and a spate of unbalanced condemnatory resolutions.
                            Ambassador Barromi, Israeli Perm Rep in Geneva, believes Arab
                            delegations may raise the issue of the deportation of the West Bank
                            mayors.</p>
                        <p>—Afghanistan: The Commission last year adopted (27–8–6) a resolution (3
                            (XXXVI)) condemning Soviet military aggression against Afghanistan.
                            Pakistan took the lead on this issue, and we would recommend following
                            Pakistan’s lead again this year.</p>
                        <p>—Bolivia: In a U.S. and Western supported resolution, the 35th <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> requested the Commission to review
                            the human rights situation in Bolivia and to accept the Bolivian
                            Government’s invitation to conduct <pb facs="0165" n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119"/> an onsite investigation.<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d39fn12">See <ref target="#d39fn5">footnote 5</ref>,
                                above.</note> The Commission will also have before it an analysis of
                            the human rights situation prepared by a special rapporteur of the
                            Sub-Commission, pursuant to Sub-Commission Resolution 23 (XXXIII). We
                            should support efforts to conduct a frank and thorough discussion of
                            human rights abuses in Bolivia since the July, 1980 coup.<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d39fn13">Reference is to General Luis Garcia Meza Tejada’s
                                seizure of power in Bolivia.</note> We should also strongly support
                            an onsite visit by the Commission, perhaps by a 3–to–5 member working
                            group, as a concrete means of further strengthening international human
                            rights fact-finding machinery.</p>
                        <p>—El Salvador: The General Assembly adopted an unbalanced resolution
                            sharply criticizing the Salvadorean Government and calling upon the
                            Commission to examine the human rights situation at the forthcoming
                                session.<note n="14" xml:id="d39fn14">See <ref target="#d39fn5"
                                    >footnote 5</ref>, above.</note> As most Western countries
                            abstained or voted in favor of the resolution at the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA_1">GA</gloss>, we can expect difficulties in achieving
                            a balanced approach by the Commission. Success will be conditioned to an
                            important degree by developments within El Salvador itself.</p>
                        <p>—Chile: We would expect the Commission to follow established lines, i.e.,
                            to adopt a resolution endorsing the report of Special Rapporteur Dieye
                            (Senegal), criticizing continuing human rights violations, and extending
                            the Rapporteur’s mandate for another year. Western countries have
                            traditionally supported such resolutions and are likely to do so again
                            at the 1981 Commission session. In the absence of significant
                            improvements within Chile, it is difficult to justify discontinuation of
                            the Special Rapporteur’s mandate. We should be prepared to remain with
                            other Western countries on this issue, accompanying our vote with an
                            appropriate explanation as in the past.</p>
                        <p>—Kampuchea: We have supported previous Assembly and Commission
                            resolutions on human rights violations in Kampuchea and should do so
                            again this year. The Commission will have before it a Sub-Commission
                            Resolution (24 (XXXIII)) recommending, inter alia, that the Commission
                            “consider inviting the Secretary-General to designate a Special
                            Representative to assist in restoring full respect for human rights and
                            fundamental freedoms as speedily as possible in Kampuchea”.</p>
                        <p>14. Country and Regional Issues (Confidential 1503 Cases): The
                            Sub-Commission referred to the Commission complaints against the
                            following thirteen countries: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, German Democratic
                            Republic, Haiti, Japan, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, El <pb

                            Mozambique, and the Republic of Korea. Information concerning these
                            cases is contained in document E/CN.4/R.66,<note n="15" xml:id="d39fn15"
                                >Not found.</note> copies of which were forwarded to the Department

                                >HA</gloss>) on November 3, 1980. The Commission also decided last
                            year to keep several additional country situations on its confidential
                            agenda on the basis of earlier complaints forwarded by the
                            Sub-Commission. A five-member Working Group of Commission members
                            (Netherlands, Panama, Zambia, Cyprus, Yugoslavia) will review all of
                            these cases at a one-week pre-sessional meeting beginning January

                        <p>Broomfield said that a new balance on human rights as a component of our
                            foreign policy was needed and he and the Secretary agreed that the
                            concern of international terrorism would rise in importance and human
                            rights would recede soon. With regard to the organization of human
                            rights within the State Department, the Secretary asked for the
                            Congressmen’s assistance in getting rid of a separate office for that
                            problem and returning it to the various bureaus. Zablocki said that he
                            was sympathetic but that he had already lost an earlier attempt to do
                            away with a subcommittee targeted to that concern in his own

                        <p>2. As usual at recent <gloss target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss> sessions,
                            several Latin American countries will be considered in public and
                            private meetings. Thus Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala are
                            scheduled for public discussion, and all four of these countries plus
                            Argentina, Haiti, Paraguay and Uruguay are scheduled for consideration
                            under the <gloss target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss>’s confidential
                            procedures. Furthermore, the report and future role of the <gloss

                            Disappeared Persons, which is of particular interest to Argentina, will
                            be considered.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">See <ref target="#d47"
                                    >Document 47</ref>.</note> Of course countries in other parts of

                            take the lead on these Latin American items, but should coordinate
                            closely with <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> group with the
                            expectation of following the <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss>
                            consensus. We want to avoid seeming to pick out Latin America for
                            special opprobrium in view of serious human rights situations in other
                            parts of the world. Often <pb facs="0168" n="122" xml:id="pg_122"/>
                            human rights abuses in the countries listed in para 2 are on a lesser
                            scale than abuses in countries whose situations are not scheduled for
                            individual consideration or have not received the same level of
                            attention as some Latin American countries. On the other hand, we do not
                            anticipate trying to oppose such concern as other <gloss
                                target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> members have about Latin American
                            issues (except in case of El Salvador).</p>

                            Congressionally-mandated human rights reports affect our bilateral
                            relations and other national interests. We expect a renewed effort by
                            certain Senators, and perhaps Members of the House, to rescind the
                            requirement for the reports. A logical first step is to solicit the
                            views of our Ambassadors on this annual requirement.</p>

                            If they should be leaked to the press, we believe this would not cause
                            any serious embarrassment to the State Department or to the governments

                                volume, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, reporting
                                practices during the previous year. The Congress mandated these
                                reports to assist it in the determination of economic and security
                                assistance.</p>
                            <p>2. (C) To assist the Department in evaluating this annual exercise, I
                                would welcome your candid assessment, including but not restricted
                                to the considerations noted herebelow. Do not solicit comments
                                outside of your Country Team.</p>
                            <p>A. How have host government, media and any other important elements
                                reacted to the 1980 report? If you have already reported some
                                reaction, cite reference.</p>
                            <p>B. What have been the beneficial and/or negative effects, if any, of
                                the 1980 and previous reports in our relations with the host
                                government? If you think that the reports have affected bilateral
                                governmental relations indicate how and why.</p>
                            <p>C. How have the reports been received by influential non-governmental
                                individuals or groups in the country?</p>
                            <p>D. Has there been any perceptible effect of the reports on the nature
                                and number of human rights violations by the host government or on
                                violations of the integrity of person by non-government groups in
                                the country?</p>
                            <p>E. On balance, what effect if any have the reports had on our
                                national interests vis-a-vis your country and region?</p>
                            <p>3. (C) Please be specific in your response. We shall make every
                                effort to maintain the confidentiality of your assessments. If any
                                significant dissenting opinions emerge within your Country Team,
                                they should be included in your report.<note n="5" xml:id="d43fn5"

                        <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> welcomed the
                            visitors, saying that the Secretary, busy with items such as El
                            Salvador, had asked him to receive them. He observed that Justice Frank
                            C. Newman of the California Supreme Court is a mutual acquaintance of
                            several of the visitors and himself.</p>
                        <p>Professor Henkin began by speaking “for a unanimous human rights
                            community.” He had hoped for a chance to talk before Dr. Lefever’s
                            appointment was announced. The appointment is “a serious mistake” and
                            has drawn more criticism than any other by the Administration.<note

                            asserted that Dr. Lefever does not understand human rights, is not
                            committed to a human rights policy, and is not the man for the job.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>’s request
                            to characterize the job, Professor Henkin said that the job is to ensure
                            that human rights remains an important element in foreign policy and to
                            enforce the human rights-related statutes enacted by the Congress. He
                            added that the appointment suggests the Administration wants to repeal
                            that legislation, and wondered aloud why Dr. Lefever wants the job, as
                            he “seems to find human rights particularly distasteful in foreign
                            policy.” Professor Henkin opined that Dr. Lefever’s views on Africa will
                            make life very difficult for the African Bureau in the Department.<note

                        <p>Mr. Neier, speaking for the Helsinki Watch, observed that Dr. Lefever is
                            on record against allowing the internal practices of states, including
                            the Soviet Union, to be a subject of U.S. foreign policy attention. To
                            allow trade decisions with communist countries to be based only on
                            economic considerations, and our foreign policy only on a communist
                            state’s external policies, would be a “radical shift in U.S. foreign
                            policy as it has been since World War II” and is in conflict with
                            positions taken by other Administration officials.</p>
                        <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> said that the
                            President and Secretary are on record as committed to human rights. He
                            was not aware of Dr. Lefever’s detailed views in the past. Judge
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> reminded his visitors
                            that he had told the Senators during his confirmation hearings that he
                            would not be in a policy-making position, but rather in a role of
                            carrying out Administration policy.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>’s confirmation hearings are
                                summarized in Judith Miller, “Senators Give <persName

                                p. A3.</note> Dr. Lefever, too, would perform such a role.</p>
                        <p>Father Drinan asserted that a man cannot be expected to implement a
                            policy he opposes. There is great concern on this point in the Church,
                            Congress, and in human rights organizations, especially in Latin
                            America. How can such a person carry out the human rights laws?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PSE_1">Palmer</persName> stated that Dr.
                            Lefever “has made clear to those of us on his staff that the law is to
                            be observed scrupulously.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carliner said that he was reassured by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PSE_1">Palmer</persName>’s statement, but focused on Dr.
                            Lefever’s preference for quiet diplomacy. Sometimes, Mr. Carliner said,
                            one must use public methods. It is unnecessarily limiting to exclude in
                            advance the use of public diplomacy. Perhaps Dr. Lefever will change his
                            previous attitudes, as is frequently done by officials after assuming
                            office. Recalling Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>’s
                            mentioning that Dr. Lefever would be in a policy implementing position,
                            Mr. <pb facs="0177" n="131" xml:id="pg_131"/> Carliner asked for “some
                            assurance as to how the human rights mandate will be carried out.” He
                            pointed out an apparent contradiction between the recent strong U.S.
                            stand against terrorism and the loosening of human rights sanctions
                            against Chile in the face of Chile’s continuing failure to cooperate
                            against terrorism.</p>
                        <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> observed that “the
                            effectiveness of sanctions must be questioned when they do not show
                            results over a considerable period of time.” Whether the human rights of
                            many more people are affected by the sanctions must also be weighed.
                            “This is a value judgment we are making in many countries.”</p>
                        <p>In El Salvador, he said, rather than making the government the target of
                            human rights concern, we are addressing the government because it has
                            jurisdiction over a particular incident—in this case, the slaying of the
                                nuns.<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5">Reference is to the December 2,
                                1980, murders of four American nuns by the El Savadorian National

                            us to continue the investigation using U.S. experts.</p>
                        <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> reminded the visitors
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> has said he
                            expects every bureau and individual to be cognizant of human and
                            personal rights, and not only those in our own situations. Human rights
                            is a very personal thing which cuts across every level and is not a
                            concern which one bureau should claim as its own. He related that at one
                            time his mother, who speaks Spanish, had noticed that a high percentage
                            of Hispanics had been called up for the draft. Without commenting
                            publicly she went to work as a translator for the draft board to see
                            what she could do to remedy the situation.</p>
                        <p>Although it might be on a much quieter level than under the previous
                            Administration, continued Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"

                        <p>Mr. Carliner said he wanted to emphasize the importance of continuing to

                            Congress. It would be conceivable that the requirement for reports could
                            be filled by a perfunctory issuance of language on <pb facs="0178"

                            basis for determining the human rights situation in countries of

                        <p>The Subcommittee heard six witnesses who are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Hon. Patt Derian, former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights
                            and Humanitarian Affairs</p>
                        <p>Michael H. Posner, Executive Director, Lawyers Committee for

                        <pb facs="0179" n="133" xml:id="pg_133"/>
                        <p>Louis Henkin, Professor of Law, Columbia University</p>
                        <p>Raymond Gastil, Director, Comparative Study of Freedom, Freedom House</p>
                        <p>Hyman Bookbinder, Washington Representative, American Jewish
                            Committee</p>
                        <p>The meeting can be summarized as follows: The human rights reports have
                            improved steadily and are very good this year. They are very useful to
                            Congress, to other organs of government and to private organizations as
                            a primary source of information on human rights questions, as a
                            forthright statement of U.S. concern and interest in human rights and as
                            a diplomatic tool which can be used in our relations with other
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>This year’s reports should be a model for future efforts both in form and
                            substance. Chairman Bonker stressed particularly the value of the
                            section on “government policies relating to the fulfillment of such
                            vital needs as food, shelter, health care and education”, and of the
                            section on government attitudes toward outside investigations of
                            internal human rights conditions. The legislation requiring the reports
                            is a result of bi-partisan interest in human rights.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d45fn2">References are to the Trade Act of 1974 and Section
                                502(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.</note> This fact
                            should be borne in mind by the new Administration.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Bonker expressed his hope and belief that human rights matters
                            would continue to occupy an important place in the Administration’s
                            foreign policy formulation. He reminded the Administration that the
                            defense of human rights had always been a bi-partisan matter in
                            Congress. Certain witnesses were less sanguine in their assessment of
                            the Administration’s intentions in the human rights field.</p>
                        <p>Ranking Republican Leach defended the Administration’s position and
                            stated that human rights is a continuing concern of the President and
                            his administration. A summary of the testimony of the witnesses
                            follows:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ms. Derian</hi> began the hearing with an 18-page
                            statement on the background and the development of the reports.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Not found.</note> The purposes of the report,
                            she stated, are to give a clear picture of the state of human rights
                            practices and circumstances during one calendar year for 162 countries.
                            They are prepared as carefully and objectively as possible and include
                            sections on integrity of the person, fulfillment of social and economic
                            needs and the enjoyment of civil and political liberties. She stressed
                            that no comparable document is published elsewhere. The primary use of
                            the report, she said, is to provide members of Congress <pb facs="0180"
                                n="134" xml:id="pg_134"/> with essential information which will
                            allow them to vote in an informed manner on “developmental, economic and
                            security assistance.” The reports have also been useful in bringing the
                            human rights situation in various countries of the world to the
                            attention of officers in the Department of State. The reports also make
                            information on the human rights situation throughout the world available
                            to the general public and to the press. They are often carefully
                            scrutinized by the leaders of foreign countries who clearly understand
                            that these reports are of decisive importance to the U.S. Congress in
                            deciding what countries will receive the help of American taxpayers’
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>In her discussion of how the reports are prepared, Ms. Derian stressed
                            the continuing efforts made to improve the reports and in particular
                            section II on government policies relating to the fulfillment of vital
                            social and economic needs. She concluded that the reports are
                            non-polemical, non-political and invaluable.</p>
                        <p>She expressed her concern that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> Administration does not appear to “grasp the
                            nature of the human rights law” and seems to be on the way to downgrade
                            human rights by concentrating on international terrorism. She believed
                            that the reports should be improved, not discontinued and she urged the
                            subcommittee to continue its practice of holding frequent meetings on
                            human rights conditions which will keep the Congress and the public
                            current on the subject and give the new Administration a forum for
                            expressing its views.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Bonker thanked Ms. Derian for her testimony and stated that the
                            reports are useful in describing not only political but economic and
                            social conditions. He said he is fully committed to the continuation of
                            the reports and said that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> Administration must understand that the reports,
                            which are a cooperative effort between the Executive and Congress, will
                            be continued.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ranking Member Leach</hi> stated that he wished to
                            recall that human rights were not discovered by the previous
                            administration and that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> Administration strongly supports the human rights
                            program. He added that this is true even though he has “personal doubts”
                            about some persons chosen to lead this effort. He questioned whether the
                            reports should be prepared and published by the U.S. Government. He
                            would prefer a study being done by an organization such as Freedom
                            House. He stressed that questions of relativity arise in discussing
                            human rights and that there may be a danger of placing too much emphasis
                            on human rights in relation to other foreign policy considerations.</p>
                        <p>He recalled that the previous administration had not always given
                            straightforward answers about the human rights situation. For instance,
                            the administration had denied that the Laotians had used chemical
                            weapons in putting down a tribal revolt in that country. He stated that
                                <pb facs="0181" n="135" xml:id="pg_135"/> an assistant secretary had
                            claimed no knowledge of such use, although it was common knowledge that
                            the Laotians had used chemical weapons.<note n="4" xml:id="d45fn4">In
                                telegram 109424 to Vientiane, April 25, 1980, the Department
                                reported that Under Secretary of State for International Security
                                Affairs <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> had testified
                                that the United States was “not in a position either to confirm or
                                disprove conclusively reports of the use of chemical weapons in
                                remote areas where the United States Government has no presence.”
                                (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800206–0003)</note> Ms. Derian expressed her astonishment that an
                            assistant secretary had said this.</p>
                        <p>She reiterated her hope that human rights should not be downgraded and
                            that we not help people to oppress others. Congressman Leach replied the
                            question is how best to carry out such a policy—whether one wears human
                            rights on one’s sleeve or whether one quietly pursues one’s objectives.
                            He added, however, that he would not advise the present administration
                            to wear anti-human rights on its sleeve. Ms. Derian replied that she
                            hoped legislation would be maintained and that she was heartened by
                            Congressman Leach’s comments. Chairman Bonker stated that the policy
                            which has been formulated in the subcommittee has been bi-partisan and
                            that this should be clearly understood. He then asked two questions:
                            Whether the reports prepared on friendly countries were disruptive to
                            our relations and how reports are prepared on countries with which we
                            have no relations.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Derian stated that the first reports were sometimes disruptive to our
                            relation with certain countries. Some such as Brazil gave up aid from
                            the U.S.<note n="5" xml:id="d45fn5">Regarding the cessation of aid to

                        <p>As for countries with which the U.S. has no relations, and where we have
                            no representation reports are prepared from such sources as may be
                            available. On countries such as Albania reports are shorter since there
                            is less information. On others such as North Korea on which there is
                            abundant public information reports are longer.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Michael Posner</hi> stated that his committee monitors
                            the administration of the U.S. human rights policy and prepares
                            critiques of the reports. The value of the reports, he stated, is that
                            they show that Congress has made it U.S. policy to promote human rights
                            throughout the world. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName>, he said, supports this policy. The annual reports
                            have many new uses. In particular, their information on the situation in
                            Eastern Europe should be a great aid to consular officers and to the
                                <gloss target="#t_INS_1">INS</gloss> in determining the validity of
                            claims for refugee status or asylum.</p>

                        <p>While the reports have vastly improved in five years, he believed they
                            are selective on certain issues and that they understate the situation
                            in many countries such as in Syria or the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. He asserted that the situation of the Jews in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was underreported. The
                            reports should be maintained, including the economic and social section,
                            and their accuracy and objectivity improved. One officer should be
                            assigned primary responsibility for the reports and given special
                            training in preparing them. He opposed discontinuing the reports by the
                            State Department, but said other agencies could supplement them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Aryeh Neier</hi> stated that his committee monitors
                            governmental practice with respect to the human rights sections of the
                            Helsinki Accords. In this connection he stated that the reports on
                            Eastern European countries are invaluable because they disseminate
                            information on non-compliance of those governments with the human rights
                            provisions of the Helsinki Agreements. The dissemination of these
                            reports by the U.S. government affords a great measure of protection to
                            many people in Eastern Europe. Their discontinuation would be a great
                            blow to these people. He stated that he would like to see a wider use of
                            names of persons persecuted by their governments in the reports. He felt
                            this would afford individuals greater protection from persecution.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Louis Henkin</hi> urged Congress to maintain
                            legislation on the reports. The reports, he stated, are a matter of
                            controversy not so much between political parties as between branches of
                            government. The executive branch does not support public reports with
                            the same degree of enthusiasm as Congress. The executive branch does not
                            like public diplomacy as characterized by the reports. Nevertheless, the
                            reports have helped us in countries such as South Africa and have given
                            us a tool to use against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                            They are widely recognized as helpful in the promotion of human
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the compilation of the reports is not an intervention in
                            the internal affairs of other countries as is often claimed. It is not
                            unlawful to criticize other countries and any country in the world may
                            determine its policies in any way it chooses including the preparation
                            of public reports on other countries. The reports serve needs other than
                            congressional ones. They can aid the Attorney General in making
                            determinations as to who should be deported. They are extremely useful
                            to bodies and groups interested in human rights. They are invaluable to
                            scholars and students. While the reports are not perfect and should be
                            improved, he expressed the hope that Congress will insist that the
                            reports be continued.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Raymond Gastil</hi> stated that the reports have
                            steadily improved in completeness and objectivity and are a major source
                            of information to the Congress and to human rights organizations. They
                            have certain weaknesses which should be corrected. Some reports tend to
                            “white <pb facs="0183" n="137" xml:id="pg_137"/> wash” the countries
                            concerned. No one would ever be aware of the hostility of the French
                            government to the press by reading the human rights report, he said.
                            Some reports are distorted. Government oppression and denial of civil
                            and political rights often are justified in terms of the need to press
                            forward with economic development. Nevertheless, he feels the reports
                            send a message to the world that the U.S. is interested in human rights
                            everywhere. That alone is invaluable.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Hyman Bookbinder</hi> stated that the United Nations
                            organization is guilty of selective morality<note n="6" xml:id="d45fn6"
                                >Reference is to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Human Rights
                                Commission.</note> and this is one compelling reason for the United
                            States to continue the publication of these reports. Preparation should
                            not be delegated to private organizations that do not have the resources
                            which can in any way compare to those of the United States. He
                            complained, however, that even the U.S. reports give some indication of
                            selective morality when they devote 19 pages of commentary to Israel
                            whereas only 15 are given to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bookbinder expressed his regret at the downgrading of human rights by
                            some members of the Administration. He stated that Ms. Derian’s
                            replacement in the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs had
                            made clear that all references to human rights should be removed from
                            statutes dealing with aid and relations with other countries.</p>

                            POLICY</hi></p>
                        <p>This Administration is determined to pursue a vigorous and humane foreign
                            policy designed to protect the integrity and independence of the United
                            States and that of its allies. At the same time, we <pb facs="0184"
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138"/> will seek to develop a world community
                            that respects diversity and fosters peaceful relations among states. In
                            making our decisions, we will take into account their impact on freedom,
                            dignity, and human rights.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, it is our intention to broaden and deepen the concept of human
                            rights which too often has been limited to a narrow range of specific
                            violations by governments against their own people. Assaults on the
                            integrity of the person, such as torture, prolonged imprisonment without
                            due process, exile under brutal conditions, and the denial of emigration
                            are always reprehensible. But we must also recognize that human rights
                            are seriously violated, and on a much larger scale, by direct or
                            indirect aggression, the imposition of foreign control over other
                            peoples, external subversion, genocide, and terrorism. Seen in this
                            perspective, human rights are an inescapable concern in all our foreign
                            policy deliberations.</p>
                        <p>Of necessity, foreign policy decisions emerge from a calculus of
                            competing ends, alternative means, and anticipated consequences. These
                            decisions always involve considerations of national security, regional
                            stability and the freedom and independence of peoples. We are determined
                            to pursue these ends with the least possible political and human
                            cost.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, there has been a lively debate on how best to integrate
                            human rights considerations into our pursuit of national security and
                            international order. There are four specific ways the U.S. Government,
                            with the support of the American people, can advance the cause of
                            freedom and dignity:</p>
                        <p>1. Perhaps the most significant contribution the United States can make
                            is to remain an example of a society which strives successfully to
                            guarantee the full range of human rights for all our citizens. Since the
                            founding of our republic, America has been regarded by peoples the world
                            over as an example to be emulated.</p>
                        <p>2. We must stand by our allies and friends when their survival as
                            independent states is jeopardized by external military pressures or
                            political subversion. It would be tragic if, in the name of human
                            rights, we were to refuse vital assistance to an ally in grave danger
                            and thus open the way for a successor regime that would abolish
                            virtually all human rights. We must be willing to help endangered allies
                            in all appropriate ways.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe that quiet diplomacy, rather than public scolding or
                            threats, is a more effective way to encourage greater respect for human
                            rights by allied and friendly governments.</p>
                        <p>4. In the face of gross violations of human rights—genocide, aggression,
                            external subversion, or terrorism—by any government, it is entirely
                            appropriate for the United States to engage in public condem<pb
                                facs="0185" n="139" xml:id="pg_139"/>nation. In the recent past and
                            at present such gross violations are largely confined to adversary
                            states, notably the Soviet Union. Most communist regimes brutalize their
                            own people, and some of them are engaged in exporting their repressive
                            systems by subversion and terrorism. Thus, they are not only gross
                            violators of human rights, but they threaten the peace as well. Moscow’s
                            conquest of Afghanistan, Cambodia’s genocide, the use of surrogate
                            forces to subvert African states, and Libya’s sponsorship of terrorism
                            all deserve public condemnation by the U.S. Government and by private
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>There is a significant moral and political distinction between <hi
                                rend="italic">totalitarian</hi> regimes that brutally repress their
                            own people and deny them virtually all political and civil rights and
                                <hi rend="italic">authoritarian</hi> regimes which permit a measure
                            of freedom and guarantee some human rights. Violations of fundamental
                            rights by any government, totalitarian, authoritarian, or democratic are
                            wrong, but we must respond to different situations with a measured sense
                            of proportion.</p>
                        <p>The world rarely presents us with a choice between the perfect and the
                            imperfect. We are usually confronted with choosing between two
                            less-than-perfect courses of action. A major factor in any decision
                            affecting another state is the foreign policy of its government. Some of
                            our Third World allies who are pursuing constructive external policies
                            simply have not developed the civic culture that can sustain the concept
                            of a loyal opposition or institutions capable of guaranteeing the human
                            rights we Americans take for granted. We must seek to understand these
                            realities or we may find ourselves in self-righteous isolation in an
                            increasingly hostile world.</p>
                        <p>In developing a deeper and more effective approach to the role of human
                            rights in our foreign relations, we seek the advice and support of the
                            United States Congress and of the scores of private groups which have a
                            distinguished record of nonpartisan humanitarian service and a genuine
                            concern for the freedom and dignity of human beings everywhere.</p>
                        <p>We Americans will not always agree on methods, but we are united in our
                            commitment to enlarging the frontiers of freedom and respect for human
                            rights in a dangerous world.</p>

                        <p>2. Summary: This report summarizes the work of the Thirty-Seventh Session
                            of the Human Rights Commission. Department please repeat as appropriate.

                        <p>3. The 37th Session of the United Nations Commission of Human Rights met
                            in Geneva February 2 through March 13, 1981. The session opened less
                            than two weeks after the beginning of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> administration. The United States Representative
                            and Principal Alternate Representative were appointees of the new
                            administration. Moreover, the delegation had to cope with political and
                            press speculation regarding a new U.S. human rights policy. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> accordingly resolved neither to be
                            defensive nor to disorient friends or foes in the <gloss
                                target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss>. Instead, <gloss target="#t_USDel_1"
                                >USDel</gloss> launched a persistent, daily effort of private
                            conversations with allies, neutrals, and foes, in order to provide the
                            background against which to interpret U.S. positions as they emerged.
                            Facing skepticism (even anxiety) and puzzlement, <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> aimed gradually to win friendship,
                            understanding, shared conviction (or grudging admission, among foes)
                            about U.S. priorities.</p>
                        <p>4. The Commission dealt with a heavy agenda with which it was not able to
                            cope fully during the six weeks of the session. Although the Commission
                            decided at the outset upon a timetable which should have allowed for
                            adequate consideration of each of the items on its thirty-item agenda,
                            the Commission by the end of its third week started to fall badly
                            behind. During the fifth and sixth weeks, the Commission resorted to
                            extended day sessions and night sessions, but was forced during the
                            final week to limit debate on the large number of resolutions put
                            forward under agenda item 13 (human rights violations in any part of the
                            world) and to give only perfunctory treatment to several remaining
                            agenda items.</p>
                        <p>5. Since it was the Latin American group’s turn for chairmanship, the
                            Commission elected as its Chairman the LA group candidate, Ambassador
                            Calero-Rodrigues, the representative from Brazil. Calero-<pb facs="0187"
                                n="141" xml:id="pg_141"/>Rodrigues personally presided at every
                            meeting throughout the session, relinquishing the chair to one of the
                            Vice Chairmen only for a brief period at the beginning of one meeting
                            when he was late in arriving. In this respect he broke with normal
                            practice. At past sessions the chairmen have extended opportunities to
                            preside to each of the three vice chairmen.</p>
                        <p>6. The following were Commission actions of special interest to the U.S.
                            delegation:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Israeli-Occupied Territories.</p>
                        <p>Following settled practice the Commission opened its substantive debate
                            by considering the recurring item relating to human rights in the
                            occupied Arab territories, including Palestine. The usual two-part
                            resolution was put forward. One part contained a blanket condemnation of
                            Israeli policies and practices and the other dealt with the application
                            of the Geneva Convention on Civilian Persons to the Occupied
                            Territories. This latter part of the resolution contained a provision
                            first put forward last year characterizing the failure to apply the
                            Geneva Convention as a grave threat to world peace and security. A
                            number of <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> delegations were
                            intending to vote against because of this characterization. Prior to the
                            vote this phrase was replaced so that the failure to apply the Geneva
                            Convention was described as creating “a situation fraught with danger.”
                            With this change, the position of all the <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> delegations except the U.S. shifted to one of support
                            for that part of the resolution. In the final vote, only the U.S. voted
                            against, with no one abstaining. In the vote on the part of the
                            resolution containing the broad condemnation of Israel, the U.S. was
                            joined by Australia and Canada in voting against, and eight
                            abstained.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Measures Against Terror or Incitement to
                            Racial or Group Hatred.</p>
                        <p>This item was placed at an early spot in the Commission timetable as a
                            part of an arrangement whereby the Eastern European group agreed to
                            split the item on self-determination, with part taken up first in
                            conjunction with the Palestine item, and part later in the session. The
                            discussion of the item on terror and group hatred centered upon a draft
                            resolution put forward by the Eastern European group of countries. The
                            U.S. delegation led consultations in the <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> group looking toward a possible resolution dealing with
                            the problem of terrorism as a human rights issue. Although there was
                            general interest in the <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> group in
                            discussing terrorism under the agenda item, and acknowledgement of its
                            importance as a human rights issue, there was also a decided general
                            view that a resolution on terrorism should not be pursued. The Eastern
                            European draft resolution, which featured Nazism and Fascism as current
                            problems, was countered by amendments proposed by several <gloss
                                target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> countries designed to broaden the
                            focus <pb facs="0188" n="142" xml:id="pg_142"/> to all totalitarian
                            ideologies. The amendments’ sponsors decided to negotiate with the
                            Eastern European sponsors, with the result that a revised text was
                            produced which was acceptable to all <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> delegations except the U.S. In the final vote the
                            revised resolution was approved with only the U.S. abstaining, on the
                            ground that the verbal formulations in the resolution are useless
                            because they merely paper over the fundamental differences of the two
                            sides.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Africa and Racial Discrimination.</p>
                        <p>Other subjects of special interest to Third World countries regularly
                            taken up early in the Commission sessions, were the four agenda items
                            relating to South Africa and racial discrimination. The discussions
                            provided the occasion for the new administration to state its views on
                            the problem of apartheid. The debate ended with votes on five
                            resolutions sponsored principally by the <gloss target="#t_HRC_1"
                                >HRC</gloss>’s African members. Of the five resolutions, the United
                            States voted against two, abstained on two, and did not participate in
                            the vote on the one relating to the decade against racism. The voting
                            pattern followed by the U.S. delegation was in line with that followed
                            in recent previous Commission sessions. In the cases of the negative
                            votes we were joined by the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and France. On the resolution
                            concerning Namibia, all of the Western Five were able to abstain.</p>

                                n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <ref target="#d41">Document
                                41</ref>.</note> featured a draft resolution by the French
                            delegation providing for a simple extension of the Working Group’s
                            existing mandate. The original French resolution went through a number
                            of changes reflecting the results of the long and arduous negotiations
                            carried on privately between the French and Argentine delegations, with
                            the active involvement of <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            Representative Lord Colville, the Working Group’s Acting Chairman and
                            spokesman. The U.S. delegation took no part in the debate on the item.
                            Our position favoring a consensus decision was expressed in the regular
                                <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> consultations and was obviously
                            a factor in the willingness of France and Lord Colville to go almost the
                            last mile to achieve consensus. The issue at stake was the extent to
                            which the Working Group would be obligated to keep its proceedings
                            confidential. The compromise language is subject to varying
                            interpretations, and its precise effect must await the functioning of
                            the Working Group during the coming year under its renewed one-year
                            mandate. The shift <pb facs="0189" n="143" xml:id="pg_143"/> in the U.S.
                            position on this issue, and our efforts to achieve consensus caused
                            strain with our <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> allies, who favored
                            the original French proposal and opposed the effort to impose rules
                            which could provide a basis for claiming confidentiality.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Self-Determination.</p>
                        <p>The recurring agenda item relating to peoples’ right to
                            self-determination was split into two parts as a result of the efforts
                            of Pakistan to assure that part of the item would be held over until
                            after the completion of the Nonaligned Ministers meeting in New Delhi.
                            The first part was considered together with the item relating to the
                            occupied Arab territories and, as has been customary, resulted in a
                            draft resolution cosponsored principally by Arab delegations supporting
                            Palestinan self-determination, and condemning the Camp David Accords.
                            This resolution received nine negative votes, including that of the U.S.
                            When consideration of the item on self-determination was resumed, three
                            resolutions were presented dealing with Kampuchea, Afghanistan, and
                            Western Sahara. A fourth resolution sponsored by some radical Third
                            World countries once again dealt with Palestine and self-determination
                            together with Namibia and South Africa. There were strong votes in favor
                            of both the Afghanistan and Kampuchea resolutions. In voting on the
                            Western Sahara, the United States reacted to the strong criticism of
                            Morocco by voting no—and gained a warm expression of appreciation from
                            the Moroccan delegation.</p>

                            resolution cosponsored once again by the leading activists on the issue,
                            Algeria, Cuba, Mexico, and Yugoslavia. In <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"

                            viewpoint found some sympathy within the group, particularly on the part
                            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and France. A further <gloss

                            henceforth be pursued under the confidential 1503 procedures did not,
                            however, find any support in the group. In the voting on the draft
                            resolution, the United States signaled its change in policy by, for the
                            first time since the Chile issue had been considered in the Commission
                            or in the General Assembly, voting against. The trend in <pb facs="0190"

                            stand on Chile was reflected in the fact that in addition to the four
                            negative votes, there were 17 abstentions so that only a bare majority
                            of the Commission voted in favor. However, much <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> support for the resolution was lost in reaction to the

                            amendments designed to bring the proposal in line with the more moderate

                            special “Chile item” from the Commission’s agenda.</p>
                        <p>Under a separate agenda item, the Commission approved and sent to <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss> a proposal to replace the Chile
                            trust fund by a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> voluntary fund for
                            victims of torture. The new fund would not be country-specific. Approval
                            of the new fund came after the Commission defeated a series of Soviet
                            amendments designed to gut the proposal and/or postpone action
                            indefinitely.</p>

                        <p>The growing concern of the Third World countries over promotion of
                            economic rights as a central task of the Commission on Human Rights was
                            reflected in the debates on this recurring agenda item. In order to
                            avoid a repetition of the situation at the past several sessions in
                            which the West has limited itself to a defensive reaction to the
                            proposals of the more radical nonaligned, the French delegation early in
                            the session instituted and led negotiations between some <gloss
                                target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> delegations (including the U.S.) and
                            some nonaligned delegations led by Algeria. The French aim, as
                            frequently explained and defended in the daily <gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> meetings, was to achieve agreement on an essentially
                            procedural resolution which could be adopted by consensus and which
                            could possibly signal the beginning of a genuine dialogue between
                            developed and less developed countries. The emerging product of the
                            negotiations gave the <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss>
                            increasing cause for concern, but France remained determined to carry
                            them forward and in the end did so without U.S. participation. The
                            resulting draft resolution was presented to the Western group by France
                            as a fair compromise and one which presented an opportunity to the
                            Western delegations which they would ignore at their peril, if their
                            governments were interested in future productive relations with the
                            nonaligned members of the Commission. The resolution was cosponsored by
                            a large number of nonaligned governments but had no <gloss
                                target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> sponsors. It was approved with only
                            one negative vote, that of the United States and two abstentions, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss>. The U.S. explained its vote by saying that the text
                            contained no genuine compromise of substance. We continue to believe
                            that a comparison with the initial Nonaligned text bears out this
                            judgment. The firm opposition of some Western delegations (e.g., Canada,
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>) to our bid for membership on the
                            expert group established by the resolution is a clear reflection of
                            their annoyance at our stand.</p>

                        <p>This item consumed by far the largest number of meetings of the
                            Commission. A perhaps disproportionate part of these meetings was
                            devoted to the confidential part of the item under which the Commission
                            acted pursuant to the procedures of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> Resolution 1503. Fourteen country situations were
                            considered in these confidential procedures. Those which occupied the
                            bulk of the Commission’s time were the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, Argentina, Bolivia, and Ethiopia. The high point was
                            the decision by the Commission to keep under review the human rights
                            situation in the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>. The low point was
                            the decision of the Commission to cease consideration of the human
                            rights situation in Ethiopia, a decision which was made almost
                            inevitable by the benignly favorable last-minute report issued by the
                            Secretary-General’s representative. In both cases the Communist
                            delegations went to extraordinary, time-consuming lengths to achieve
                            dismissal. Other highlights of the 1503 proceedings were the decision to
                            keep the case concerning Afghanistan under review, the dismissal (at
                            least partly at U.S. urging) of the case against Japan, the decision to
                            keep the Argentina case under review, including the disappeared persons
                            part of that case, the refusal to move the Bolivian case from public to
                            private proceedings, the dismissal of the case concerning Paraguay, the
                            continuation of the case concerning Uruguay, and the decision to keep
                            the case concerning the Republic of Korea under review. A final episode
                            which occurred at the end of the 1503 proceedings involved the
                            initiative undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to
                            reopen the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> case as a result of the
                            publication in the local press of an interview given by the U.S.
                            representative. The interview evidenced a breach of the rule of
                            confidentiality and led to an explanation of regret by the U.S.
                            representative. After several delegations objected to nullifying the
                            decision on the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> deleted that portion of its
                            proposal. However, the adopted decision deploring the breach of
                            confidentiality contains language which the Soviets will no doubt cite
                            in trying to dismiss the case against the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1"
                                >GDR</gloss> next year.</p>
                        <p>The public proceedings under this agenda item began as the Commission was
                            entering its final week. Because of the heavy workload, the Chairman was
                            forced to set time limits on statements, with the result that many
                            Western delegations were unable to say as much about the worldwide human
                            rights situation as they had intended. A record number of resolutions
                            was put forward under the public part of the item, including two
                            important U.S. initiatives: The draft resolution condemning the taking
                            of hostages and a draft decision assuring consideration next year of the
                            plight of <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName>.<note n="4"

                            hostages resolution, <pb facs="0192" n="146" xml:id="pg_146"/> which in
                            its original conception was designed to secure a condemnation of Iran
                            for its taking and maltreatment of the hostages, was throughout the
                            session progressively modified to remove in the end any direct or
                            implied mention of a target country. The generalized version was easily
                            approved by consensus. The draft decision concerning <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> was greeted by a counter
                            resolution from Byelorussia focusing on the racial situation in the
                            United States and designed to force a withdrawal of the U.S. proposal.
                            In the end, the draft decision and the draft resolution, together with
                            another set of resolutions involving Jordan/Syrian charges and
                            counter-charges, were disposed of, over U.S. opposition, by a procedural
                            motion to take no decision. However, in a separate resolution implicitly
                            intended to cover dissidents in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe, the Commission strongly reaffirmed
                            the right to defend human rights and deplored “all harsh and punitive
                            treatment” of people who exercise this right.</p>
                        <p>The issue which consumed the greatest amount of the time of the U.S.
                            delegation concerned El Salvador. Engaging in long discussions within

                            the Netherlands delegation acting as leader, the <gloss

                            outcome which saw the adoption of a comparatively moderate

                            Algerian/Mexican/Yugoslav text. Other important decisions taken under
                            the item which were supported by the United States concerned the human
                            rights situations in Guatemala and Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The Commission took a step toward implementing last year’s resolution on
                            mass exoduses by deciding to appoint a Special Rapporteur to study the
                            question of human rights and mass exoduses.</p>

                            gradually transformed, primarily through U.S. efforts, into a document
                            much more in concert with Western concepts, values, and priorities.
                            Although Eastern Bloc obstructionism eventually prevented consensus in
                            the Working Group on strengthening <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            human rights machinery, the group was able to focus the discussions
                            largely on Western proposals to develop an intersessional role for the
                            Commission’s bureau, and to lay the groundwork for further consideration
                            of this subject next year. As this working group was allotted only six
                            meetings, there was insufficient time to explore the limits of Eastern
                            flexibility on this and related issues. The proposal for a High
                            Commissioner, which was dealt with mainly outside the framework of the
                            Working Group, saw no progress, but we understand Senegal intends to
                            pursue the matter at the next General Assembly.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">J. Subcommission on Discrimination and
                            Minorities.</p>
                        <p>At the initiative of the Brazilian delegation, the Annual Report of the
                            Subcommission on Discrimination and Minorities was given a more
                            prominent than usual place in the timetable, with the result that a
                            quite thorough examination of the Subcommission’s role took place. The
                            Brazilian intention was to underscore its concern over recent tendencies
                            of the Subcommission to move beyond its mandate and assigned functions
                            without the authority of its parent body. While the Brazilian critique
                            received some sympathetic echo in the debate that took place, the end
                            result was only a mild resolution of concern with no restriction at all
                            on the Subcommission’s existing mandate. A related item concerned the
                            election of the entire Subcommission membership. Of the 26 seats open,
                            six were available to <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> candidates.
                            Of the seven <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> candidates, the U.S.
                            nominee narrowly defeated the seventh candidate in a runoff vote. This
                            election outcome was the first time that a U.S. candidacy for a post on
                            a body in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss> structure came
                            so close to failing.</p>
                        <p>6. The foregoing summary of the results reached with respect to the
                            principal items on the agenda of the 37th Session of the Commission
                            features a number of specific accomplishments in line with United States
                            objectives. In a number of cases, the United States delegation was in a
                            minority position, extending in three cases to isolation. More important
                            than the tally sheet of resolutions adopted and votes <pb facs="0194"
                                n="148" xml:id="pg_148"/> recorded must be the impression made by
                            the United States delegation speaking for the new administration. Our
                            daily contacts with the <gloss target="#t_WEO_1">WEO</gloss> delegations
                            and less systematized contacts with delegations of other regions assured
                            knowledge of and, we believe, a growing understanding of our new
                            approaches and the new points of emphasis. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> had the principal task of
                            continuing the traditional U.S. emphasis on human rights, while
                            executing smoothly a new administration’s unique sense of strategy and
                            tactics. The change in strategic focus by the United States delegation
                            consisted in advocating three main substantive points: (1) no more
                            double standards in the Commission; (2) human rights exist in mediating
                            institutions of due process and in constituencies committed to
                            moderation and law in making such institutions work; and (3) the special
                            threat to human rights institutions posed by the new international
                            terrorism. With respect to voting patterns, the United States delegation
                            maintained overall consistency with past U.S. positions; the most
                            striking differences occurred in changed strategy and tactics for
                            improving the human rights situation in South and Central America.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein explained that the Helsinki Watch had not taken a position
                            on Dr. Lefever’s nomination, but is concerned about the perception that
                            the new administration is less mindful of human rights than the former.
                            He pointed out that use of the authoritarian/totalitarian dichotomy and
                            the terrorism/human rights concept, and the failure to condemn the
                            attempted Spanish coup<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">On February 23,
                                members of the <hi rend="italic">Guardia Civil</hi> held the Spanish
                                Parliament hostage for 22 hours in a failed coup attempt.</note>
                            early on were signals of diminished interest in human rights. Mr. Schell
                            and Mr. Neier questioned the wisdom of using quiet diplomacy with
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever outlined U.S. human rights policy. He said that we oppose
                            torture everywhere. We will operate mainly with quiet diplomacy,
                            although gross and consistent violations may require condemnation in a
                            public forum. The Soviet Union, the world’s worst violator of human
                            rights at home and abroad, will be condemned publicly.</p>
                        <p>In describing his intention to deepen and broaden the concept of human
                            rights, Dr. Lefever called for more attention to the possible results of
                            an intended punitive move on human rights: would human rights conditions
                            only worsen if the government were replaced by one more oppressive?
                            Other U.S. interests, such as security, are overriding in Argentina, but
                            improved results on human rights are expected from quiet diplomacy
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein asked that the U.S. try to assist the Helsinki Monitors as
                            we wind up the Madrid conference and offered to help in publicizing
                            human rights violations when it would be useful. Dr. Lefever welcomed
                            the critical support of NGOs and asked for patience should there be
                            disagreement on the means of promoting human rights. End Summary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein explained that the Helsinki Watch had not taken a position
                            on Dr. Lefever’s nomination. They had called on him because of their
                            interest in human rights.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said he had a longstanding personal interest in human rights.
                            He is against torture everywhere. He might differ with some people on
                            methods for supporting human rights; one should not go about bashing
                            one’s friends for human rights violations. We should oppose gross
                            violations wherever they occur; sometimes this would call for public
                            condemnation.</p>
                        <p>This administration is committed not only to quiet diplomacy; already it
                            has used public fora, such as the U.N. Human Rights Commission.</p>
                        <pb facs="0196" n="150" xml:id="pg_150"/>
                        <p>Speaking from a cleared statement, Dr. Lefever said that he could assure
                            the group that this administration will seek to deepen and broaden the
                            concept of human rights, applying the policy as equally as possible. It
                            is important to keep in mind that expectations of United States
                            omnipotence are illusory. Nevertheless, the commitment to human rights
                            is there, as the Secretary has said repeatedly. We will pursue human
                            rights in a more effective manner, quietly, but with vigorous private
                            arm twisting, if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schell said that the Helsinki Watch tries not to be strident and to
                            be informed. He hoped that Dr. Lefever believes in human rights; he
                            should not head <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> if he didn’t.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever replied that he should not be an American if he didn’t
                            believe in human rights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schell responded that that is what we are all about. He referred to
                            his recent trip to Geneva and Madrid, observing that a great contrast
                            exists between approaches to human rights in the two cities. In Geneva,
                            it seemed that we had chosen to go easy on some human rights violators.
                            Despite <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Max Kampelman</persName>’s<note

                            this perception seemed to have gained currency in Madrid. Romanian
                            Ambassador Dactu had told him that the next session of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> conference should be held in
                            Bucharest, saying that he could give him all the assurances he wanted
                            for the same access by organizations and press that were enjoyed in
                            Madrid. When Mr. Schell reminded Dactu that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is dedicated to human rights, underlining the
                            importance of an improvement in the Romanian record, Dactu had replied,
                            “You know perfectly well your government is easing up on human
                            rights.”</p>
                        <p>On the perceptual level, this is a problem. In Argentina, General Viola
                            gave the same assurances of improvement one and a half years ago that he
                            is giving in now to us in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said that the successes of quiet diplomacy are difficult to
                            communicate. Progress might well have been better in Argentina with
                            quiet diplomacy. We have security interests in Argentina. We have
                            informed Argentina and Chile that we want improvement in relations<note

                        <p>Mr. Neier asked about the six thousand missing persons for whom the

                        <p>Mr. Bernstein pointed out that the public perception of U.S. human rights
                            policy has been hurt by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName>’s dichotomy <pb facs="0197" n="151"

                                    target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note> and by the Secretary’s
                            failure to back democracy in Spain until it seemed certain that
                            democracy had survived the coup attempt.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever replied that the Secretary had been emphasizing <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> opposition to terrorism. He had gone
                            on to explain that terrorism was a serious abuse of human rights. There
                            is now an agreed statement on human rights policy.</p>
                        <p>Normally quiet diplomacy can accomplish more with it one can be more
                            effective—twist arms if necessary—than in an atmosphere of
                            confrontation. The U.S. ambassadors with whom he has spoken say that
                            they prefer quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>There are exceptions to the rule of quiet diplomacy, Dr. Lefever added.
                            If violations are gross and consistent, the situation may cry out for
                            condemnation in a public forum. Private groups such as the Helsinki
                            Watch should speak out regularly; governments are more restrained,
                            carrying the burden of diplomacy. When you cannot have naval maneuvers
                            or arms cooperation with certain countries, it is not good for the cause
                            of freedom in the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schell said he believed that Dr. Lefever and Helsinki Watch views are
                            much closer together than one might realize. We are building up our
                            arms, as the Soviets know well. He observed that Dr. Lefever has a
                            difficult problem with which to contend. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration is not
                            well-known for its support of human rights. Dr. Lefever’s personal
                            dedication is to human rights, but Viola and Dactu don’t know it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever replied that Viola is starting to know it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schell stated that this office (<gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss>)
                            is the protector of human rights. Dr. Lefever must make clear that he is
                            dedicated to human rights.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Laber observed that the concept of <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss>
                            in the previous administration was that it should be the conscience of
                            the State Department.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said that this had been discussed. Deepening the concept of
                            human rights is important. People tend to use a two dimensional concept
                            of human rights. Speaking hypothetically, he said that if bad things are
                            happening, if four nuns are killed for example,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d48fn7">See <ref target="#d44fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    44</ref>.</note> and we react against the government, thereby
                            paving the way for a regime which kills 400 nuns, what of our first
                            reaction then? We must consider what may happen later. Abuses cannot be
                            ignored, but we must weigh the alternatives. Would more repression
                            result?</p>
                        <pb facs="0198" n="152" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                        <p>The human rights component was present in all State Department decisions,
                            even before <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> existed, and will
                            continue to be. It is present because of the sensitivity of individual
                            officers. We are not going to let up on human rights now but are going
                            to implement our continuing concern in a more effective way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Neier pointed out that bringing along the West Europeans had been a
                            tremendous accomplishment during the implementation review phase in
                                Madrid.<note n="8" xml:id="d48fn8">In telegram 8095 to USNATO,
                                January 12, the Department reported that the implementation review

                                and mentioned the support for human rights issues from the Western

                        <p>Dr. Lefever attributed some of the problems to the haste with which
                            preparations had to be made for the meeting. The dispute concerning the
                            Working Group on Disappearances involved its confidentiality. This
                            government had decided at high levels to move on that track. Men may
                            differ on this point. Our delegation was disturbed at the lack of focus
                            on other violations, equally serious, such as the abuse of psychiatry.
                            The country-specific approach creates difficulties also.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Neier favored the non-country specific approach, i.e., to focus on
                            all offenders, denounce all, and to vote for all country-specific
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever explained that this administration has a fairly coherent view
                            of human rights methods. U.S. ambassadors do not support more
                            condemnation and more punitive measures announced in public. This
                            administration is more interested in results than rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Neier agreed that results were our objective, and pointed out that
                            Hungary does not list political prisoners. They want MFN treatment;
                            thus, their people are not in jail. Hungary responded to the threat of
                            punitive economic measures, the withholding of MFN.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said this is the essence of the Jackson-Vanik amendment,<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d48fn11">The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies “Most
                                Favored Nation” status to non-market states that restrict

                            adversary countries <pb facs="0199" n="153" xml:id="pg_153"/> where
                            abuses tend to be greater. The Soviets are attempting to export
                            repression; it is more appropriate to go public in criticism of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Neier expressed concern that Cold War rhetoric will weaken East-West
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever replied that the Soviet Union is a vast system of violations
                            of liberty—the worst in the world—and demands a different type of
                            attention than an ally which puts some people in jail. We will just go
                            about it differently in such cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein pointed out that private organizations can help. The
                            Helsinki Monitors are a key symbol of human rights in the Soviet Union.
                            But private groups need to have trust that quiet diplomacy is not a
                            dodge.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said he is against the hobnail boot on the neck of another
                            human being, anywhere in the world. This is the real world where other
                            countries have foreign policies of their own. In Argentina, the dead are
                            dead. We want to improve the behaviour of Argentina, but the government
                            will not admit to the disappearances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Neier claimed that the Argentine government operates concentration
                            camps.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said we must deal with Argentina, but quietly. The noise
                            level, even in dealing with adversary states, may be reduced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schell asserted that Dr. Lefever should have no illusions about
                            Argentina; the Argentine government uses Hitler-style tactics.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever answered that diplomacy is not a mutual admiration society.
                            We do not seek to restore normal security ties with Argentina because we
                            like the Argentines. There is a better chance for progress on human
                            rights there if we cooperate on a range of issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein summed up the purpose of the visit by expressing hope that
                            a solution in Madrid will include something for the Helsinki Monitors.
                            He said that the U.S. can get more for the two Soviet spies in South
                            Africa than <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Shcharanskiy</persName>. The
                            Helsinki Watch hopes some way can be found to help the Monitors; a
                            conference on family reunification would not be sufficient balance in
                            post-Madrid human rights <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>
                            activities. He urged that <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> use NGOs to
                            make noise when it is useful to aid quiet diplomacy. Finally, he said
                            there is a need to redress an imbalance in the public perception of
                            diminished respect for human rights by the new administration.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lefever said he will cherish and respect critical support from groups
                            with the same ideals. He asked for understanding if there is
                            disagreement on means. Honest people disagree on means, he said, but
                            warned of the dangers of successor governments to regimes whose methods
                            we may not like in the short run.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>It should be kept in mind throughout that the questions and answers
                            concern only the Reports, as such, not our over-all human rights policy.
                            Embassy replies provide much evidence of the obvious fact that the
                            latter exerted far more influence than the Reports. Although
                            generalizations can easily be misleading (if only because of the vast
                            variety of political, economic and social factors and conditions
                            encompassed) it is apparent that the Reports, by themselves, have not
                            had a major impact on our foreign relations. But it would be a mistake
                            to assume, therefore, that the Reports have been of little or no
                            consequence. They constituted a significant element of the human rights
                            policy in recent years.</p>
                        <p>In almost 100 countries the Reports are perceived to have had little or
                            no <hi rend="italic">net</hi> effect on our national interests
                            (including instances in which positive and negative effects
                            approximately balanced out). In some 33 countries our Embassies judged
                            the Reports had, on balance, served our national interests, while in 11
                            others they appear to have had a net negative effect.</p>
                        <p>In 23 replies the Ambassador and/or Country Team recommended termination
                            of the Report, as distinct from our policy, at least for their
                            countries. Some of these considered it useful to continue the Reports on
                            Governments with poor human rights records. Embassy replies from only
                            six countries were negative across the board, that is, negative on the
                            effect on bilateral relations, negative on the effect on our national
                            interests, and recommending termination of the Reports (at least for
                            those countries on a public basis). The six were Israel, Argentina,
                            Brazil, Chile, Yugoslavia and France. (Embassy Paris did not reply to
                            the five questions but these are understood to be the views of
                            Ambassador Hartman.) In 20 countries our Embassies recommended
                            continuation of the Reports. About a dozen Embassies urged shortening or
                            tightening the format, with less attention to economic and social
                            considerations.</p>

                            updated versions of last year’s report, with increased emphasis on
                            rights involving the integrity of the individual and civil and political
                            rights. Guidelines for a somewhat broader focus on these rights are
                            included. A shorter section dealing with vital economic and social needs
                            should be rewritten, using universal economic indicators to be provided
                            posts by the Department. Objectivity should be maintained. A schedule of
                            submission dates will be established by septel, with the first group of
                            reports due September 15. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department plans to provide Country Human Rights Reports to
                            Congress for 1981, in keeping with the continuing legal requirement for
                            such materials. As you are aware, the reports are intended to assist
                            Congress in assessing human rights conditions in connection with
                            congressional decisions on economic and military assistance. It is
                            essential that the reports maintain the objectivity for which they are
                            widely recognized. The reports volume should continue to serve as a work
                            of reference on human rights conditions in each country in the light of
                            that country’s historical, economic and security situation.</p>
                        <p>3. It will not be necessary to draft entirely new reports for 1981.
                            Instead, posts should largely update last year’s reports with
                            information concerning events in 1981, using the basic text (if still
                            applicable) and same general approach of the 1980 reports. Any new
                            trends, positive as well as negative, should be identified and fully
                            documented.</p>
                        <p>4. The section dealing with the fulfillment of vital needs should be
                            totally revised and shifted from Section II to become Section IV of the
                            1981 report. This reflects a strong <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            concern that while human aspirations repeat aspirations for the
                            fulfillment of vital economic, social and cultural needs must be met to
                            the maximum extent, the <pb facs="0204" n="158" xml:id="pg_158"/> urgent
                            and pressing rights repeat rights involving the integrity of the person
                            and civil and political liberties should be emphasized.</p>
                        <p>5. The new report format would thus be as follows: Introduction (summary
                            comments and description supported by information contained in the body
                            of the report); Section I (entitled Respect for the Integrity of the
                            Person, including freedom from: A. Torture, B. Cruel, Inhuman or
                            Degrading Treatment or Punishment, C. Disappearances, D. Arbitrary
                            Arrest and Imprisonment, E. Denial of Fair Public Trial, F. Invasion of
                            the Home); Section II (entitled, Respect for Civil and Political
                            Liberties, including: A. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
                            Assembly, B. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
                            Emigration and Repatriation, C. Freedom to Participate in the Political
                            Process); Section III (entitled, Government Attitude and Record
                            Regarding International and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
                            Violations of Human Rights); Section IV (entitled, Economic and Social
                            Circumstances).</p>
                        <p>6. The Department expects that the primary focus of the report will be on
                            the degree of respect for the right to the integrity of the person and
                            for civil and political rights. Posts should be guided in their approach
                            to updating in these areas by last year’s drafting instruction telegram,
                            which is being repeated (80 State 224684). Additional mention, however,
                            of the degree of respect accorded the right to participate in the
                            political process should be made. A closer look at the right of assembly
                            with respect to labor unions also is desirable.</p>
                        <p>7. Posts should broaden their focus on the rights of the person and civil
                            and political rights by directing attention this year to significant
                            violations of human rights perpetrated in the host country not only by
                            the government but also by opposition or insurgent groups or by agents
                            of other governments, excluding border skirmishes. The use of terrorist
                            methods by foreign and domestic elements should be examined. An attempt
                            should be made also to portray the wider context of the human rights
                            situation, including threats from hostile powers. Such mention, as
                            appropriate, may be included in Sections I and II.</p>
                        <p>8. The new Section IV should provide a brief survey of the economic,
                            social and cultural environment within which the government administers
                            polices affecting economic and social needs of the country. This should
                            include reference to the extent to which these needs are met on a
                            non-discriminatory basis. For most posts, Section IV should center upon
                            the broad categories of (A) Health and Nutrition, (B) Education and, (C)
                            Income and Poverty, using statistical economic indicators, which the
                            Department will provide, to support the discussion.</p>
                        <p>9. The following indicators for each country drawn from World Bank
                            figures will be sent septel to be integrated into the discussion:</p>

                                target="#t_IMEC_1">IMEC</gloss>) need not submit more than a table
                            with the economic indicators and a brief statement on the extent to
                            which food, shelter, health care and education are available to all
                            inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
                            political opinion. More extensive reporting in this section is desirable
                            from other countries so as to continue to inform Congress and the public
                            of the degree of economic and social development in non-<gloss

                        <p>11. In updating the new Section III, posts need not report the
                            international human rights and refugee conventions to which the host
                            government is a party. The Department will place a table containing this
                            information in the reports volume, derived from listings available in
                            Washington, as was done last year.</p>
                        <p>12. A schedule for submission will be established shortly by septels from

                        <p>Mr. Carliner said their primary reason for coming to see the Deputy
                            Secretary is to discuss the vacancy in the position of the Assistant
                            Secretary of State for Human Rights. Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clark</persName> responded that this issue has not been forgotten.
                            Under Secretary for Management <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Richard
                                Kennedy</persName> has been studying the reorganization of several
                            State Department positions. An announcement will be made in about two
                            weeks, but it would be an unfair tipping of the hand to go into detail
                            now. If the reorganization requires Congressional approval, which it may
                            not, the approval will be sought. The prior administration’s human
                            rights policy, said Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>,
                            was not a resounding success—“I prefer to speak of personal or
                            individual rights”. We recognize our national responsibilities in that
                            area, and there has been no slippage on that account in this
                            administration. Amnesty International has reported a worldwide reduction
                            in political prisoners. The defeat of Dr. Lefever has nothing to do with
                            our current plans for restructuring of the human rights bureau, although

                        <p>Mr. Carliner expressed his view that, if the Human Rights Bureau is
                            subsumed into another bureau, it would be considered by observers <pb
                                facs="0207" n="161" xml:id="pg_161"/> to be a diminution of concern
                            for human rights. Similarly, a change of the name “human rights” to
                            individual or personal rights would also be given a more symbolic
                            importance than it would deserve. Human rights has an international
                            significance. Dealing exclusively with the concept of individuality and
                            personality, while extremely important, would fail to address group
                            problems, such as those of Jews in the Soviet Union and, historically,
                            Armenians in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sussman observed that Freedom House has always used the term
                            “individual political and civil liberties”. Social and economic concerns
                            are important, but only as desirable categories. If individual rights
                            are protected, then social and economic needs will be satisfied more
                            easily. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName> at
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meeting in Madrid has
                            operated splendidly in a situation in which our geo-political interests
                            coincide with outspoken human rights concerns. Radio Liberty and Radio
                            Free Europe would be able to deliver a strong message by reporting U.S.
                            human rights concerns. He urged the Administration to marshall all its
                            available tools, including human rights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carey said that there is no magic in the use of the formulation
                            “human rights”, because he has seen personally how civil liberties
                            evolved into civil rights and human rights. The important thing is to be
                            out there pushing for individual rights. It is an effective way to fight
                            communism. Emphasis on the individual is the best way to be
                            forceful.</p>
                        <p>Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> responded that “this
                            is certainly the thinking of the Secretary. We have not lost sight of
                            the concern you have brought here today, and as the policy unfolds, I
                            would like to receive your further comments”. Mr. Carey asked if the
                            statutory functions of the human rights bureau are to continue. Judge
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> said that they would
                            “continue until Congress says otherwise”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carliner summed up by saying he understood that no decision would be
                            made on filling the human rights job before a decision is made on the
                            position itself. Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                            expressed agreement.</p>

                            “human rights” isn’t something we add on to our foreign policy, but is
                            its very purpose: the defense and promotion of liberty in the world.

                        <p>I have asked Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott
                                Abrams</persName> to ensure that human rights and humanitarian
                            affairs occupy a prominent place in the formulation and conduct of our
                            foreign policy. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AE_1"
                                >Abrams</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> Bureau
                            will be working closely with all regional and functional bureaus. The
                            promotion of political freedom should not be considered only as an
                            afterthought. Rather, it should be integral to our work and we should
                            give careful thought to means to advance this goal in our day-to-day
                            diplomacy. Quiet diplomacy, public statements, and economic and security
                            assistance policies should all be <pb facs="0218" n="172"
                                xml:id="pg_172"/> given close scrutiny for the impact they can have
                            on expanding civil liberties and political rights.</p>
                        <p>I count on you and <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> to work together in
                            this effort, and want you to instruct your staffs to pay close attention
                            to these issues in discussions you and our Embassies have with foreign
                            government officials here and abroad. I particularly want you to include
                            background and talking points on these considerations, whenever
                            relevant, in the briefing papers you do for me and department principals
                            for our meetings with foreign officials. We must be sure to convey to
                            these officials the continuing interest of Congress, the American
                            people, and the Administration in the expansion of personal and
                            political freedom.</p>
                        <p>Our preferred method of action is traditional diplomacy, especially as to
                            friendly countries where public accusations can harm relations and
                            therefore make it more difficult to achieve our human rights goals.
                            Private communication can be more precise, and less offensive to
                            feelings of national sovereignty, and can often be more effective.
                            Public chastisement is a weapon in our arsenal as well, and will be used
                            when appropriate, but diplomacy should be our usual tool. You and your
                            staff should continue, wherever appropriate, to undertake vigorous
                            diplomatic initiatives on human rights matters. Human rights abuses
                            violate our fundamental principles and inevitably harm relations with
                            the U.S. Your efforts to reduce these abuses, especially in friendly or
                            neutral countries, will thus help lay the basis for better relations and
                            will serve our mutual interests.</p>
                        <p>Many questions have been asked about the policy of the Administration in
                            this area. In order to provide some guidance, I am attaching a memo<note

                        <p>3. Commission Officers and Agenda: It was the Eastern European group’s
                            turn for the Chairmanship and, as foreseen, they selected Ivan Garvalov
                            of Bulgaria for the post. The Vice-Chairmen were Prof. Kooijmans
                            (Netherlands), Amb. Salah-Bey (Algeria), and Amb. Pouyouros (Cyprus).
                            Argentine Mission Counselor Daverede was chosen Rapporteur. The
                            provisional agenda was adopted without debate, since the U.S. had
                            decided on the basis of intensive consultations in capitals and in
                            Geneva to raise the Polish issue<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Reference is

                        <p>4. Organization of Work (Poland: Phase One): The U.S. and Western
                            countries brought the Polish issue to center stage on the second day
                            through substantive statements by Canada and Denmark (the latter for the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–10), and by the tabling of a
                            draft decision expressing concern about violations in Poland, according
                            priority to the Polish question under Item 12 (violations anywhere in
                            the world), and requesting the Secretary General to prepare an initial
                            report for consideration at the present session. Western statements on
                            Poland and on the draft decision were frequently interrupted by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its friends on points of
                            order, and Syria eventually moved adjournment of debate on the draft
                            decision until Item 12. Overruling (and in some cases merely ignoring)
                            procedural objections from Senegal, Brazil, and several Western
                            delegations, Chairman Garvalov pushed the Syrian motion to a vote in
                            which all <gloss target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss> delegations plus Japan,
                            Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay refused to participate. Although its
                            subsequent “adoption” by 11–0–14–14 (non-participation) meant that
                            Poland was not formally given <pb facs="0220" n="174" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                            priority, <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> accomplished its
                            initial objectives of focussing early attention on Poland while forging
                            a strongly united Western position on the issue. Beyond that, we
                            obtained priority anyway by tabling the Polish resolution before any
                            other resolutions under Item 12. Had our draft decision come to a vote,
                            winning votes were possibly available. But the procedural wrangles
                            resulted in a dramatic, suspended meeting, much press attention, and
                            building suspense for the rest of the session. The Bulgarian Chairman
                            seemed to bend or ignore the rules and otherwise move lazily; the
                            resulting bad publicity increased the pressure on him to be more
                            conscious of his reputation—and the rules—late in the session. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> won the support of barely a
                            quarter of the Commission’s membership. The result demonstrated relative
                            strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>5. Israeli-Occupied Territories: After the initial debate on Poland, the
                            Commission settled into the time-honored ritual of belaboring Israel for
                            alleged misdeeds in the occupied territories and also, this year, for
                            its decision to annex the Golan Heights. The Commission adopted the
                            usual two-part resolution (a) condemning Israeli policies and practices
                            in the occupied territories and (b) condemning Israel’s refusal to apply
                            the fourth Geneva convention to the occupied territories. The vote was
                            virtually identical to that in 1981: On Part A (32–3–7), the U.S. was
                            again joined by Canada and Australia in voting no, and was alone in
                            voting against Part B (41–1–0). The resolution condemning the decision
                            to annex the Golan Heights was adopted 22–11 (<gloss target="#t_WEOG_1"
                                >WEOG</gloss> minus Greece plus Japan and Fiji) –7. Peru and the
                            Philippines refused to participate. Under the agenda item on
                            self-determination, the Commission also adopted another resolution this
                            year rejecting the Camp David Accords and endorsing the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. Although the final vote (24–8–10)
                            fell only slightly below last year’s tally (25–9–8), a separate vote on
                            a paragraph rejecting the Camp David Accords was retained by only 17–12
                            (U.S.) –12. The vote last year on a similar paragraph was 21–11 (U.S.)
                            –10.</p>
                        <p>6. Scientific and Technological Developments: Although the Eastern Bloc
                            asked that this item be scheduled early in the session in order to serve
                            its all-fronts disarmament campaign, Western delegations were able to
                            focus much of the discussion on Soviet abuse of psychiatric confinement.

                            passed four resolutions under this agenda item (versus one last year).
                            The first was similar to last year’s, a Byelorussian text on the use of
                            science and technology to ensure “the right to work and development.” It
                            passed 31–0–12 (<gloss target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss>, Japan,
                            Philippines); last year’s tally was 28–1 (<gloss target="#t_UK_1"

                            resolution condemning the Israeli raid on Iraq’s nuclear reactor was
                            adopted 30–1 (U.S.) –11 (Japan, Costa Rica, Fiji, <gloss
                                target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss> minus Greece). A Soviet disarmament
                            resolution passed 32–0–11 (Japan, China, <gloss target="#t_WEOG_1"
                                >WEOG</gloss> minus Greece) after having been substantially modified
                            through negotiations. A <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> resolution on
                            protection of persons detained in psychiatric institutions and endorsing
                            the Subcommission’s ongoing work in this area was adopted by
                            consensus.</p>
                        <p>7. Africa and Racial Discrimination: The four agenda items related to
                            these subjects were again dealt with at length for four largely wasted
                            days early in the session. The debate followed traditional and
                            predictable lines, with no surprises. The Commission adopted five
                            resolutions under this cluster of items. US was able to shift from no
                            (1981) to abstention this year on the general resolution on violations
                            in South Africa; however, we found ourselves alone in not supporting the
                            text (adopted 41–0–1) because last year’s five abstainers and two other
                            negative votes went into the yes column this time. On Namibia, the vote
                            (37–0–6) was almost identical with last year’s tally; the same was true
                            for the resolution on the Apartheid Convention (32–0–11) and the Decade
                            Against Racism (34–0–8); the US abstained on the first two resolutions
                            and did not participate in the vote on the decade. The vote on adverse
                            consequences of assistance to South Africa was 32–4 (US, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                            France) –7 (other WEOS plus Japan).</p>
                        <p>8. Self-Determination: As was the case last year, the Commission adopted
                            resolutions on Afghanistan, Kampuchea, the Western Sahara, and Southern
                            Africa. All were basically similar to their predecessors, except that
                            the last-named differed from its 1981 counterpart by omitting references
                            to the Palestinians. Pakistan again took the lead on the Afghanistan
                            resolution, which passed 32–7–4, closely approximating last year’s tally
                            of 31–8–3. The result on the Kampuchean resolution showed a similar
                            trend (28–8–5 this time compared with 26–9–6 last year). The US voted
                            for both resolutions. The Western Sahara resolution was adopted 27–3
                            (US) –13, as compared with 26–5–11 a year ago. The resolution on
                            self-determination in Southern Africa passed 32–8 (US) –3, which differs
                            from last year’s tally only by the addition of one yes vote.</p>
                        <p>9. Right to Development: This issue, which stands near the top of the
                            priority list for a substantial number of members of the Commission, was
                            the subject of extended public discussion and intensive consultations,
                            led by Senegal and France, to develop a consensus resolution. The effort
                            very nearly succeeded (40–0–1 (US)), and the resulting text is a
                            significant improvement over last year’s version. Although the US was in
                            the end instructed to call for a vote and abstain, our constructive
                            attitude during the protracted consultations, as well as during the four
                            weeks of Right to Development Working Group meetings over the past <pb

                            recognized by some as a positive move; on recent <gloss target="#t_GA_1"

                        <p>10. The Subcommission: The Commission adopted five resolutions related to
                            the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
                            Minorities. The one which sparked the most interest was an Italian-Costa
                            Rican resolution to direct the Subcommission to prepare proposed terms
                            of reference for a High Commissioner for Human Rights and to submit its
                            recommendations to the next Commission Session. The idea arose from the
                            Subcommission’s own strong display of interest in this approach last
                                summer.<note n="6" xml:id="d57fn6">In telegram 9068 from Geneva,

                                on a <gloss target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss> vote on a measure
                                urging the establishment of the post of High Commissioner for Human
                                Rights. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D810427–0991)</note> The proposal was adopted 29 (US) –8–6 after the
                            Commission narrowly approved (16–15 (US) –12) a set of Brazilian
                            amendments which soften it in some minor respects but leave its
                            essential elements intact. Once again, Greece deserted the West by
                            supporting the amendments; a no vote, or even an abstention would have
                            been decisive in our favor. The Commission also approved three
                            resolutions submitted to it by the Subcommission. A resolution to create
                            a new Presessional Working Group on Indigenous Populations was adopted
                            35 (US) –0–7. A resolution on slavery and slavery-like practices
                            (apartheid, prostitution, etc.) passed 34–0–9 after a separate vote
                            approved (30–7 (US) –5) retention of a paragraph calling for mandatory
                            economic sanctions against South Africa. A third resolution, on the
                            publication of the <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>’s Report on Child
                            Labor, was adopted without a vote. Finally, the Commission adopted an
                            Australian-Byelorussian proposal reaffirming the <gloss target="#t_SC_1"
                                >SC</gloss>’s terms of reference and urging that special care be
                            taken in cases where an alternate expert must be appointed. The latter
                            provision is intended to discourage the practice of appointing permanent
                            mission officers and other government officials as alternates for the
                            elected members, who are, in principle, independent experts.</p>
                        <p>11. Poland: Adoption of a strong resolution on Poland, providing
                            follow-up action by the Secretary-General, was the major US objective at
                            this session. Intensive, US-led consultations within the Western Group
                            began well before the Commission session opened and continued on a <pb
                                facs="0223" n="177" xml:id="pg_177"/> daily basis throughout the
                            entire period. These consultations, including repeated high-level
                            démarches in capitals<note n="7" xml:id="d57fn7">In telegram 22116 to
                                multiple recipients, January 28, the Department transmitted the text

                                of State, Central Foreign Policy File, D820047–0611)</note> and
                            soundings among selected non-Western delegations, produced a common
                            Western draft resolution and strategy. Further intensive and sustained
                            lobbying in non-Western capitals and among non-<gloss target="#t_WEO_1"
                                >WEO</gloss> delegations gradually increased the number of
                            commitments to support our resolution. Repeated démarches in capitals
                            helped to ensure against slippage; equally important, they enabled us to
                            secure commitments of support against the expected Eastern procedural
                            moves to prevent a decision on the resolution itself. When the crunch
                            came on the night of March 10, it quickly became apparent that these
                            extraordinary efforts had borne fruit: On the first vote, we defeated by
                            13–20–8 a Zambian motion to postpone action until next year. Subsequent
                            procedural motions went our way by even larger margins. The final vote
                            on the resolution almost exactly matched our expectations: 19 in favor,
                            13 opposed, and 10 abstentions, with 1 not participating. The Polish
                            question clearly provided the main drama at this year’s session; even
                            when other topics were being discussed, the Polish issue remained in
                            people’s minds; we worked hard to keep it there. When we finally reached
                            the hour of decision, the atmosphere in the packed hall was charged with
                            anticipation. Because of our earlier efforts, we were confident of
                            success. That we were able to reach a decision at all is due primarily
                            and essentially to the intensive lobbying described above. In
                            retrospect, we see that it was also critically important that ours was
                            the first resolution tabled under this catch-all agenda item, and
                            therefore had to be taken up before the dozen or so other controversial
                            (and time-consuming) proposals submitted under it. This point is worth
                            remembering for future top-priority initiatives; in the past, we and our
                            allies have sometimes been too slow in tabling our proposals, with the
                            result that we are forced into a damage-limiting posture, or, equally
                            bad, that our initiatives are not even considered. Our clear-cut resolve
                            precluded this happening in the case of the Polish resolution.</p>
                        <p>12. Disappearances: The debate on this item centered around the annual
                            report of the <gloss target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss> Working Group
                            established two years ago to deal with the problem of enforced
                            disappearances, and on the need to renew the <gloss target="#t_WG_1"
                                >WG</gloss>’s mandate for another year. The debate lacked the
                            suspense of last year’s discussion and the overall tone was much more
                            moderate. A controversy erupted over whether the International
                            Commission of Jurists could designate Emilio Mignone, the head of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>’s Argentine affiliate, as its

                            /> Martinez objected, asserting that Mignone, a well-known human rights
                            activist and former Undersecretary in Peron’s government, was
                            politically-biased against the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss>. In
                            the end, most delegations agreed that an <gloss target="#t_NGO_1"
                                >NGO</gloss>’s right to select its representatives should not be
                            restricted, and Mignone was able to address the Commission. Later in the
                            session, the Commission adopted by consensus a French resolution
                            extending the Working Group’s mandate for another year.</p>
                        <p>13. Chile: Although there is growing sentiment in Western delegations to
                            eliminate the separate agenda item on Chile and include the question
                            under the general item on human rights violations, this goal could not
                            be reached this year. An Uruguayan amendment to this effect was defeated
                            13 (US) –22–7; a similar proposal by the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> last year was rejected 12 (US) –19–12. The Commission
                            then adopted, 28–6 (US)–8, a resolution very similar to last year’s,
                            once again extending the mandate of the public Special Rapporteur. The
                            vote last year was 22–4 (US) –17.</p>
                        <p>14. Country-Specific Action by the Commission Under the Confidential
                            Procedures: The Commission considered eight countries this year under
                            the confidential procedures established by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> Resolution 1503. It decided to drop the cases
                            concerning Paraguay (19 (US) –8–13), the Republic of Korea (30 (US)
                            –7–4), and Venezuela (consensus). After a hard-fought battle, the
                            Commission voted 22 (US) –12–11 to keep the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1"
                                >GDR</gloss> under review. The vote last year was 19 (US) –14–9, but
                            it should be noted that a preceding vote, which tested the substance of
                            the resolution, went our way by only one vote. On Afghanistan, the
                            Commission voted 33 (US) –7–2 to keep the situation under review. In
                            1981, the resolution on Afghanistan was adopted without a vote, but only
                            after the acceptance of amendments which tended to soften it. This
                            year’s resolution is couched in stronger terms. The Commission decided
                            by consensus to keep Argentina, Uruguay, and Haiti under review. The
                            resolution on Uruguay includes a clause looking toward possible
                            discontinuation of the case next year. Inclusion of this provision made
                            the resolution acceptable to the Uruguayan delegation. <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> contributed to this outcome.</p>
                        <p>15. Violations Anywhere in the World (Public Procedures): the Polish
                            issue, discussed elsewhere in this message, clearly dominated the
                            proceedings under this item. El Salvador was probably the second major
                            topic. Given the General Assembly voting pattern of Commission members
                            on the El Salvador issue, it seemed fairly clear from the outset that
                            our efforts would have to be of a damage-limiting character. Our initial
                            exploration of the possibility of a moderate, balanced resolution
                            persuaded us that the prospects were dim at best, and that we should try
                            instead to erode support for the expected condemnatory resolution. The
                            Salvadoran Ambassador fully shared this view, and we worked <pb
                                facs="0225" n="179" xml:id="pg_179"/> closely with him throughout
                            the session. The results were mixed, leaving the final outcome (25–5
                            (US) –13) almost exactly the same as the <gloss target="#t_GA_1"
                                >GA</gloss> pattern. The only significant shift was the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, which went from yes to abstain. The
                            Salvadoran delegation expressed warm gratitude for our efforts. A strong
                            resolution on Guatemala passed 29–2–12 (US), and a balanced text on
                            Bolivia was adopted without a vote. On Iran, the Commission adopted (19
                            (US) –9–15) a strongly-worded resolution focussing on summary and
                            arbitrary executions and on the plight of the Baha’s. A highlight of the
                            Commission’s work under this agenda item was the report of Prince
                            Sadruddin Aga Khan on human rights and mass exoduses; Prince Sadruddin’s
                            personal prestige, and the intellectual power and depth of his report,
                            focussed special attention on the issue. (E.g., a separate speakers’
                            list was opened for discussion of the topic.) A Canadian resolution
                            providing for follow-up action was adopted by consensus. Another
                            Canadian proposal, on the right to individuals and groups to promote
                            human rights—designed to express moral support for Helsinki Monitors and
                            similar groups—also passed by consensus. It goes beyond previous
                            resolutions on this subject by requesting the Subcommission to prepare
                            draft Principles for the Commission’s 1984 Session. The Commission also
                            adopted a Danish resolution deploring summary and arbitrary executions
                            and providing for the appointment by the Chairman of the Commission of a
                            Special Rapporteur to examine the question and prepare recommendations.
                            Ethiopia cast the lone negative vote on the proposal; there were several
                            abstentions. (Given the bias shown by the Bulgarian Chairman, attention
                            will have to be paid to try to ensure that the Rapporteur will be of
                            high caliber.) The Commission also adopted by consensus a resolution,
                            similar to one last year, concerning <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss>-system assistance to Equatorial Guinea in rebuilding the
                            institutional framework needed to effectively safeguard human
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>16. Working Groups: The Commission’s Working Group on the drafting of an
                            international convention against torture registered some progress under
                            its new Chairman, Herman Burgers (Netherlands). However, the fundamental
                            issues of universal jurisdiction and of implementation still remain
                            unresolved, in the former case because of Argentine obstructionism. If
                            efforts are not made to bring Argentina around, it can be anticipated
                            that next year’s work on the convention will not be conclusive. As
                            reported comprehensively septel, the <gloss target="#t_WG_1">WG</gloss>
                            drafting a Convention on the Rights of the Child also moved forward,
                            albeit at a stately pace, with <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss>
                            again serving as <gloss target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss> spokesman and
                            coordinator, with primary responsibility for drafting and negotiating
                            numerous revisions and amendments to unsatisfactory Polish draft
                            convention. The Working Group considering a draft Declaration on the
                            Rights of Minorities, a Yugoslav project, was relatively less active <pb
                                facs="0226" n="180" xml:id="pg_180"/> but did complete preamble. The
                            fourth working group, on alternative approaches, forwarded several
                            nuts-and-bolts proposals intended to improve the functioning of the
                            Commission. They include the possible rescheduling of the sessions of
                            the Subcommission and Commission to provide a more logical sequence of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> human rights meetings (e.g.,
                            Subcommission, Commission, <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_GA_1">GA</gloss>); establishing at the next <gloss
                                target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss> session an informal agenda group to
                            “rationalize” (i.e., redraft the titles of) the agenda items for the
                            succeeding session; considering the establishment of a time limit on
                            statements (in order to avoid the lack of discipline which led to a
                            lengthy series of late-night meetings this year); and examining the
                            organization and functioning of open-ended working groups. The
                            resolution also provides for continued consideration of the High
                            Commissioner proposal, taking into account the work which is to be done
                            by the Subcommission under the separate resolution on the subject.</p>
                        <p>17. The Totalitarian Ideologies: In the closing moments of the final
                            substantive session, the Commission agreed to postpone until next year
                            the consideration of any action under this item. In recent years, the
                            Soviet Bloc has used this item as a propaganda vehicle to criticize
                            Western countries for allegedly tolerating a resurgence of Nazism and
                            Fascism. This year, the item fell into the oblivion of the
                            end-of-session calendar and was not even debated. The East Bloc made a
                            half-hearted attempt at the last minute on behalf of a draft which would
                            have narrowed the scope of the resolution from totalitarianism to
                            Nazism/Fascism, but withdrew in the face of Western opposition
                            (principally from the Netherlands). The Netherlands also objected that
                            the Eastern Bloc sponsors had made no effort to consult with Western
                            countries on the text and had ignored language in previous resolutions
                            on the item which was widely acceptable.</p>
                        <p>18. Advisory Services: This item, another perennial end-of-session
                            footnote, received little attention again this year. However, the
                            Commission approved by consensus a Ugandan resolution calling for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>-system human rights assistance to Uganda
                            to help rebuild its judicial and related institutions.</p>
                        <p>19. Alternative Approaches: In addition to the aforementioned proposals
                            by the working group on this subject, the Commission also adopted by
                            consensus a resolution providing for the wide dissemination of the
                            recently-adopted declaration on the elimination of religious
                                intolerance.<note n="8" xml:id="d57fn8">See <ref target="#d47fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 47</ref>.</note> The US co-sponsored the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>20. The <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> made a special effort
                            this year to develop and maintain closer liaison with accredited NGOs. A
                            series of meetings with <pb facs="0227" n="181" xml:id="pg_181"/> them
                            at the US Mission, a reception, and a luncheon strengthened and improved
                            our relationships. The NGOs said they appreciated these efforts from our
                            standpoint, we welcomed their important inputs of ideas and information.
                            Further development of close relationships with human rights oriented
                            NGOs is recommended. Some of them expressed interest in having meetings
                            in Washington or New York prior to the start of next year’s Commission
                            session. We suggest Department and <gloss target="#t_USUN_1"
                                >USUN</gloss> bear this in mind when we begin next year to gear up
                            for the Commission.</p>

                            <p>Our human rights policy has two “tracks”, the negative and the

                            <p>Our human rights policy has two goals. First, <hi rend="italic">we
                                    seek to improve human rights practices in numerous
                                    countries</hi>—to eliminate torture or brutality, to secure
                                religious freedom, to promote free elections, and the like. <hi
                                    rend="italic">A foreign policy indifferent to these issues—if US
                                    influence could ameliorate conditions—would not appeal to the
                                    idealism of Americans, would appear amoral, and would lack
                                    public support</hi>. Moreover, these are <hi rend="italic"
                                    >pragmatic, not utopian, actions</hi> for the US. Our most
                                stable, reliable allies <pb facs="0229" n="183" xml:id="pg_183"/>
                                are democracies. Our reputation among the populace in important
                                countries that are dictatorships will suffer if we come to be
                                associated with repression rather than progress. Often the people
                                whose rights we are defending are the national leaders of future
                                years.</p>
                            <p>The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration
                                differs from the previous administration over the most effective
                                tactics to achieve these pragmatic goals. <hi rend="italic">Our
                                    litmus test is effectiveness. With friendly countries, we use
                                    diplomacy, not public pronouncements</hi>. We seek not to
                                isolate them for their sins and thereby render ourselves
                                ineffective, but to use our influence to effect desirable change.
                                    <hi rend="italic">Our goal is to achieve results, not to make
                                    self-satisfying but ineffective gestures</hi>.</p>
                            <p>But the second goal of our human rights policy sometimes conflicts
                                with this search for effectiveness: we <hi rend="italic">seek also a
                                    public association of the US with the cause of liberty. This is
                                    a pragmatic, not just idealistic goal: our ability to win
                                    European cooperation and defeat Soviet propaganda will be harmed
                                    if we seem indifferent to the fate of liberty</hi>. Friendly
                                governments are often susceptible to quiet diplomacy, and we
                                therefore use it rather than public denunciations. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >But if we never appear seriously concerned about human rights
                                    in friendly countries, our policy will seem one-sided and
                                    cynical</hi>. Thus, while the Soviet bloc presents the most
                                serious human rights problems, we cannot let it falsely appear that
                                this is our only human rights concern. <hi rend="italic">So a human
                                    rights policy does inescapably mean trouble—for example, from
                                    friendly governments if we pressure them, or from Congress if we
                                    appear not to be doing so</hi>. Yet a human rights policy
                                embodies our deepest convictions about political life, and our
                                interests: the <hi rend="italic">defense and expansion of
                                    liberty</hi>.</p>

                            and the American Jewish community), and to urge them to make direct and
                            if possible coordinated approaches to the Soviet Union, we propose to
                            send a senior person to brief European governments—someone with
                            sufficient prestige to have access to senior European leaders and
                            officials. Our recommendation would be <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                >Walter Stoessel</persName>, who is widely known and respected in
                            Europe, and who knows the situation in the Soviet Union. He would be
                            assisted by one or two experts from the Department.</p>
                        <p>The team would travel to approximately ten countries of Europe. The
                            mission should maintain a relatively low public profile, to impress upon
                            the Europeans the seriousness of our purpose. If possible, this point
                            could be emphasized by having you meet briefly and privately with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> before the
                            team’s departure.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we would utilize existing multilateral fora, including
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Human Rights Commission and the

                            worsening situation of Soviet Jewry. And, assuming our official briefing
                            team is well received, we could encourage a selected high level
                            American-Jewish delegation to make follow-on visits to European

                            </opener>
                            <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Walter
                                    Stoessel</persName> to make a special trip to several countries
                                in Europe to let you know of my concern about the human rights
                                situation in the Soviet Union. The situation concerns me because of
                                the importance I attach to the Helsinki Final Act commitments,
                                because of the terrible costs that are being paid by individual
                                human beings, and because our overall relationship with the Soviets
                                is seriously affected by human rights violations. Our Western
                                countries have been working hard to find ways of dealing with the
                                Soviet Union that enhance the chances for peace. Arms control
                                negotiations are naturally a major focus of this effort. But I am
                                convinced that human rights must be another, and for that reason we
                                give it a central role in our discussions with the Soviets.</p>
                            <p>In some cases our talks with the Soviets have made us hopeful that
                                progress is possible. Yet, at the same time, Soviet performance on
                                human rights has deteriorated badly in several specific areas; one
                                manifestation of this is the drastic cutback in the number of Jews
                                and other Soviet minority groups permitted to emigrate. There is
                                also evidence that a renewed anti-Semitic campaign is underway. The
                                current repression of human rights points to a decision to eliminate
                                ties between the Soviet people and the outside world that are not
                                under the complete control of the authorities. This includes jamming
                                of Western broadcasts, cutbacks in international telephone service,
                                harassment of Western tourists who seek contact with Soviet citizens
                                and the continued campaign of arrest and imprisonment of Soviets who
                                express ideas not in keeping with official policy. <persName

                                the elimination of his direct contact with the outside world, and

                            presented US views on human rights situation in the Soviet Union to
                            Vatican officials. Cardinal Casaroli said that the church agreed with US
                            concerns and the need to continue raising these issues. Casaroli said
                            the Helsinki process was particularly valuable. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> and
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> met
                            July 6 with the Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Casaroli and Under
                            Secretary of the Council for Public Affairs of the Church, Archbishop
                            Silvestrini, to explain US views on the Soviet human rights situation
                            and seek the Vatican’s ideas.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> outlined
                            the worsening human rights situation in the Soviet Union, particularly
                            the plight of Jews and groups associated with monitoring the Helsinki
                            Accords. He emphasized the President’s concern with these developments
                            and that pursuit of human rights issues is an important part of our
                            policy toward the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                >Stoessel</persName> noted that our approaches to the Soviets on
                            these questions might take various forms but that we considered human
                            rights questions of paramount importance. Now that the Madrid <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meeting seemed to be coming to a
                            conclusion, we would not stop raising these issues with the Soviets, but
                            would keep a dialogue alive.</p>
                        <p>5. Cardinal Casaroli responded that the church agreed completely with the
                            general US approach. He said that public pressure on the <pb facs="0238"
                                n="192" xml:id="pg_192"/> Soviets was not all bad, but that
                            sometimes public pressure needed to be combined with private approaches
                            to be most effective. Casaroli observed that approaches to the Soviets
                            on these questions had to be tailored to the situation, and often
                            involved several different tactics. Frequently, a private approach was
                            more effective; in other cases combined public/private pressure seemed
                            to work. The Cardinal said he agreed completely on the overall need to
                            maintain a dialogue on these issues.</p>
                        <p>6. In this connection, Casaroli said that the Helsinki process had been
                            most useful. He said he disagreed with those who opposed the process and
                            felt that it was valuable to have some objective words for which the
                            Eastern European “totalitarian regimes” must be accountable. The Marxist
                            state’s view of man, he noted, considered the individual a part of a
                            collective, devoid of any personal, individual dignity. This philosophy
                            was directly opposed to the church’s view of man. For this reason, it
                            was necessary to keep these regimes engaged on these issues. At the same
                            time, Casaroli noted that when pressing human rights concerns in Eastern
                            Europe it was necessary to keep our interests in proportion. Assuming
                            our ultimate objective was the avoidance of war, which could be a
                            tragedy for the planet, we had to be careful in raising the expectations
                            of oppressed peoples. Poland, the Cardinal suggested, was a case in
                            point. It was necessary to craft our approaches carefully to have a
                            maximum impact without creating conditions which might contribute to an
                            eruption—an eruption which the West probably would not be a position to
                            support. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                            agreed with the Cardinal’s observations and assured him that the US was
                            cognizant of these factors and they formed part of our approach.</p>
                        <p>7. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> handed the
                            Cardinal the President’s letter to the Pope,<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2"
                                >See the attachment to <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note>
                            expressing the hope that our consultations with the Vatican on human
                            rights matters would continue. Cardinal Casaroli agreed that this would
                            be useful. In an aside to Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> on leaving, Monsignor
                            Silvestrini said that the Vatican raised individual human rights cases
                            with the Soviet Embassy in Rome but with rare success.</p>
                        <p>8. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> has

                                >Kampelman</persName> outlined a possible joint allied

                            immediately following the conclusion of Madrid, which would state the

                            continue systematic consultations on <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> human rights issues. Italian Amb. Bilancioni suggested

                            governments proposing this course, and Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1"
                                >Kampelman</persName> suggested that this question might also be
                            taken up at a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting in the near
                            future, perhaps as early as next week (when Amb. <persName

                            work remains to be done, but it appears that the caucus has accepted
                            this course of action and will be consulting with their respective
                            governments on next steps. For action requested, see comment in para 24.
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> reviewed <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> concerns over human rights situation
                            in the Soviet Union and highlighted need to keep human rights on our
                            agenda after the conclusion of the Madrid meeting. He pointed out that
                            the U.S. has no magic formula for dealing with this matter. He welcomed
                            the opportunity to exchange views with the members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> caucus, which has, like the Madrid
                            meeting itself, been an important forum for exchanging views on human
                            rights issues. <pb facs="0240" n="194" xml:id="pg_194"/> Although the
                            Madrid meeting may be drawing to a close, he pointed out, we should not
                            allow our interest in human rights to lapse.</p>
                        <p>4. Amb. Kastl (<gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) led the sequence of
                            replies to Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>’s
                            opening remarks, emphasizing that everyone wants to preserve a network
                            of fora in which to focus on human rights and human contacts. A major
                            success of the Madrid meeting has been the opportunity it has presented
                            to us to keep public opinion attuned to such issues and to highlight the
                            provisions of the Helsinki Agreements and the commitments of 35 nations
                            to live up to those agreements. There are other ways to do this, he
                            added, noting in passing that Chancellor Kohl’s party, the <gloss
                                target="#t_CDU_1">CDU</gloss>, had actually opposed the Helsinki
                            Final Act when it was signed in 1975 but now supports it. Most recently,
                            he commented, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> has concentrated
                            on emigration problems, especially those of ethnic Germans. He thought
                            that blunt speaking at the Madrid meeting and to Soviet representatives
                            in Moscow and elsewhere can be helpful in improving that situation.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_WCC_1">Williams</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>) followed with two warnings about
                            possible future problems. A) We should resist the Soviet line that
                            movement in human rights can only come after progress in detente, rather
                            than vice versa. The neutral and non-aligned countries have not yet
                            understood this question and we need to attack the issue so that they
                            will recognize it. B) The Western press is concentrating too much on the
                            final stages of the negotiations in Madrid, i.e. the textual placement
                            of the human contacts meeting. We should stress instead the fact that
                            the HC meeting is actually going to take place, and to take place before
                            the Vienna Review Conference. This is the icing on the cake represented
                            by the rest of the draft concluding document. As Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> has pointed out, “we do have
                            problems with our public opinion, with some believing that you can’t
                            have better emigration from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            while the U.S. is being beastly to the Soviet Union”.</p>
                        <p>6. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_RRR_1">Rogers</persName> (Can) commented
                            that he feared there might be a tendency for ministers who come to
                            Madrid for the closing ceremonies not to speak much about
                            implementation. This would be a mistake, since the situation is now
                            worse in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> than it has been and
                            getting worse in Poland. We need to focus on this fact rather than on
                            the words in the document. Rechnagel (Denmark) indicated that in his
                            view we already have a forum for pushing our views on human rights: The
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> process. Moreover, we have
                            improved this forum via the Madrid meeting by providing for regular
                            follow-up meetings. The human rights and human contacts meetings are to
                            take place and Vienna<note n="5" xml:id="d63fn5">Reference is to the
                                1986–1989 <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meetings in
                                Vienna.</note> is expected to add others of the same type. There
                            will also be <pb facs="0241" n="195" xml:id="pg_195"/> bilateral human
                            rights roundtables among many participants. Moreover, we can call
                            attention to our spectacular victory on the human contacts meeting.</p>
                        <p>7. Bilancioni (Italy) commented that we have done a good job in Madrid
                            even if the final document is incomplete and unclear. Above all, the
                            document will be read in the East, much more than in the West. He asked
                            whether the <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> mission had
                            spoken at the Vatican about the Pope’s visit to the Baltic States. Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> replied that the
                            subject of Poland had been discussed with Cardinals Casaroli and
                                Silvestrini.<note n="6" xml:id="d63fn6">See <ref target="#d62"
                                    >Document 62</ref>.</note> The Vatican, he continued, is still
                            trying to evaluate the results of the Pope’s trip to Poland,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d63fn7">In June 1983, Pope John Paul II traveled to Poland
                                and visited Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.</note> but they consider
                            it in general to have been successful. They consider that the Pope
                            encouraged the Polish people but order was maintained, which could be
                            seen as a gain for the Polish Government. The Vatican thinks that
                            further progress is possible but that a lifting of martial law would not
                            mean the end of strict controls.</p>
                        <p>8. Greek Amb. Papadakis asked whether there was not another way to keep
                            attention on human rights every day, via foundations for example. Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> responded that we
                            need a combination of things. We can intensify our liaison with public
                            groups dealing with the matter; we can enhance the coordination of
                            official presentations we make to the Soviet Government (démarches on
                            specific cases, replists, etc.); and we can look into ways to increase
                            the role of our Embassies in Moscow, although they are already doing
                            very fine work.</p>
                        <p>9. Amb. Curien (France) noted that we agree on the many ways our work
                            here in Madrid will have an impact on the human rights situation. We
                            cannot expect the walls to come tumbling down at the first trumpet call,
                            however, reminding his colleagues that it took seven tries for that to
                            work at Jericho. If we fail at Madrid, however, we will lose all those
                            opportunities. In effect, he reasoned, we have to live with the Soviet
                            Union and its various practices, but we must keep trying to improve them
                            systematically.</p>
                        <p>10. Amb. Mevik (Norway) drew attention to a White Paper published by his
                            government several years ago,<note n="8" xml:id="d63fn8">Not further
                                identified.</note> which reported that progress in the human rights
                            field was more likely in conditions of détente. While it was difficult
                            to establish that link conclusively, there was one. He agreed with his
                            Canadian colleague about our lack of enforcement measures. However, we
                            have refined our instruments <pb facs="0242" n="196" xml:id="pg_196"/>
                            here and, in his opinion, we have moved the Soviets on this. He
                            recommended that human rights and human contacts be put on the agenda
                            for all talks with Soviet leaders, stressing that we need to adopt an
                            offensive but not an aggressive attitude.</p>
                        <p>11. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName> said he would
                            try to concretize some of what had been said. As Amb. Curien had said,
                            there is need to deal with the matter more systematically. We could not
                            have moved as far as we have in Madrid without consultations among the
                            16 (<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) and the 17 (<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> plus Ireland). We need not lose this
                            system as Madrid ends, but should continue it. Bilateral meetings with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are important and there
                            should be no such meetings without attention to human rights. We should
                            continue to develop consensus within the sixteen and seventeen. On the
                            basis of continued caucus consultations, we should further develop our
                            coordinating system among ourselves. Perhaps we should all designate a
                            senior official to deal with human rights problems in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and those officials might consult
                            regularly among themselves several times a year.</p>
                        <p>12. In Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName>’s view, the
                            West needs to plan and consult on these matters. Words will get lost
                            without a system and we can start in Madrid. We can’t just trumpet our
                            success here at Madrid because the other reality exists and we must
                            highlight its inadequacies. At the end of the Madrid meeting, he
                            suggested, we could have a press conference announcing that our human
                            rights concerns are not over as they have not been resolved.
                            Accordingly, we intend to pursue a systematic method of consultation
                            regarding this subject during the period between <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meetings. Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName> continued that, in speaking
                            of “we”, he did not mean to prejudge the issue of who would be included
                            in that group. Should we, for example, include countries such as
                            Austria? Perhaps in such cases, it would be better to coordinate on an
                            ad hoc basis.</p>
                        <p>13. Amb. Croin (Netherlands) spoke briefly to indicate that basically he
                            agreed with everybody else. His minister, he noted, will not be too
                            exuberant about the concluding document. His line is apt to be that the
                            document is deficient but it has good points. Croin concluded that
                            public opinion is very important.</p>
                        <p>14. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> pointed to the
                            intervals which are expected to occur between <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> meetings. He realized that bilateral discussions were
                            important but pointed out that multilateral meetings, such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, could also play a
                            role. They could add to the moral pressure on the Soviet leaders,
                            enhance public awareness of the problems and encourage public action. As
                            did Amb. Croin, he emphasized the importance of public opinion in this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>15. Norwegian Amb. Mevik took the floor again, this time to stress his
                            view that we should avoid overemphasizing human rights at the <pb
                                facs="0243" n="197" xml:id="pg_197"/> expense of other <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> elements. Without the participation
                            of the Eastern European states there is no <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>, he commented, and we must give them something so that
                            they will go along with the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>
                            process. As examples, he offered such items as economic cooperation and
                            security matters. In his opinion, moreover, we should avoid making too
                            direct links between progress in the various <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> areas.</p>
                        <p>16. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Amb. Kastl suggested that it is
                            not only states which can play a useful role on human rights. Young
                            people are often more concerned about human rights in Central America
                            than in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or Eastern Europe. We
                            should, therefore, get in touch with non-governmental organizations such
                            as the Socialist International. This would show that our concern for
                            human rights is not a cold war phenomenon.</p>
                        <p>17. <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Amb. <persName corresp="#p_WCC_1"
                                >Williams</persName> cautioned that we can’t change things overnight
                            in Eastern Europe. If the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act were
                            actually carried out, the Soviet system would disappear overnight. We
                            should understand the incremental nature of the process and try to get
                            Soviet recognition of what is acceptable behavior. He noted, as an
                            example, that the Soviets in Madrid no longer speak of “so-called human
                            rights” but simply of human rights. Concluding, he asked that we not
                            bad-mouth our real achievements here.</p>
                        <p>18. Danish Amb. Rechnagel seconded Kastl’s remarks on the need to avoid
                            the appearance that we have a selective human rights policy. He added
                            that both legal and political means are necessary to pursue an effective
                            policy in this area.</p>
                        <p>19. Italian Amb. Bilancioni suggested that his Budapest experience and
                            that of Rechnagel argued that we insist on talking with the Eastern
                            Europeans as well as the Soviets. This, in his opinion, could serve to
                            widen the gap between them. He also agreed with Kastl about the
                            importance of Latin America. Many European young people are closer
                            socially and culturally to Central America than to the Soviet Union.
                            Bilancioni added that with regard to “Max’s statement” (para 11), he
                            would be inclined to go even further and suggest that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> caucus members agree on an
                            interrogatory letter to be presented to their governments.<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d63fn9">Not further identified.</note> The letter would
                            propose that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> caucus call a

                            its intention to continue regular consultations on the human rights
                            aspects of <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>20. Canadian Amb. <persName corresp="#p_RRR_1">Rogers</persName>, in
                            connection with Bilancioni’s suggestion (para 19), asked whether the
                            regular meetings at <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> of Eastern
                            European experts might not be a useful forum for discussion [of] human
                            rights issues. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName>
                            agreed, and seconded Bilancioni’s sug<pb facs="0244" n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198"/>gestion for an interrogatory letter. He also
                            suggested that the question of continued <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>-related consultations on human rights matters be taken
                            up at a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting in the near
                            future, perhaps as early as next week. The participants at the luncheon
                            meeting indicated their agreement to start taking the steps necessary to
                            implement the Bilancioni and <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1"
                                >Kampelman</persName> suggestions.</p>
                        <p>21. Spanish DepRep Cuervo commented that his government understood the
                            need to hammer away at human rights problems. Spaniards of his
                            generation, he commented, had to strive for a long time before attaining
                            their present democratic liberties.</p>
                        <p>22. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> concluded the
                            meeting by emphasizing again that his mission was an exploratory one and
                            that we would be getting in touch bilaterally with the countries which
                            he had not been able to visit on this trip.</p>
                        <p>23. In a conversation with Greek Amb. Papadakis after the luncheon, Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> handed him the
                            non-paper (ref B), asking him to pass it on to his government. Noting
                            the importance of the Greek role as <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                            President, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                            told Papadakis that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would brief
                            the Greek Government through the EPC channel on the results of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> mission. Papadakis
                            in turn said his government would be in touch with the <gloss

                        <p>24. Comment: Much work remains to be done, but it does appear that the
                            caucus had agreed in principle that an interrogatory letter should be
                            done along the lines suggested by <persName corresp="#p_RRR_1"
                                >Rogers</persName>, Bilancioni and Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1"
                                >Kampelman</persName>. It will probably not be possible, however, to
                            coordinate with respective governments before Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> meeting on July 13. Therefore, if this initiative is
                            to be pursued vigorously, some follow-up may be desirable in Washington.

                            expressed appreciation for the <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                >Stoessel</persName> mission and general agreement with its goals

                                >Stoessel</persName> party called briefly on Foreign Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HSG_1">Sir Geoffrey Howe</persName>, met at

                        <p>3. Call on Foreign Secretary: After an overall presentation of US
                            concerns, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                            suggested continued consultations after the close of the Madrid <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meetings. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> presented President <persName

                            worsened Soviet human rights behavior, and for suggestions on how the
                            West could encourage improvement.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_HSG_1">Howe</persName> agreed that the situation
                            regarding Soviet Jewish emigration had worsened during the past five
                            years, but noted that the high levels of emigration achieved during
                            détente constituted a somewhat anomalous interlude between periods of
                            more “normal” low levels of emigration. <gloss target="#t_FCO_1"
                                >FCO</gloss> Soviet Department Head Broomfield added that although
                            Soviet human rights practices had begun to worsen long before Andorpov’s
                            accession as General Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_AYV_1"
                                >Andropov</persName> could still be regarded as the architect of the
                            policy, part of an overall crackdown instituted during his term as
                                <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> Chief. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> noted that the heightened
                            anti-Semitic campaign had begun since <persName corresp="#p_AYV_1"
                                >Andropov</persName>’s takeover.</p>
                        <pb facs="0246" n="200" xml:id="pg_200"/>
                        <p>—In Broomfield’s view, the Soviets regret having admitted the principle
                            that a particular nationality group (such as Jews or Germans) could be
                            allowed to emigrate to a national homeland outside the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. This set a troublesome precedent
                            which they now wish to reverse. They will clamp down until the problem
                            disappears, relenting only in particular cases where the political cost
                            in Western public opinion is high.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_HSG_1">Howe</persName> felt the West should be
                            able to get much more political mileage out of the Soviet human rights
                            issue, particularly in Third World countries. He called the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> initiative an important one,
                            and hoped it would generate as many constructive ideas as possible.</p>
                        <p>4. Meeting with Parliamentary Under-Secretary Whitney: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> presented the non-paper (ref
                            A) and outlined its main features. He suggested strong statements by
                            Ministers at the Madrid Concluding Sessions, calling for continued
                            consultations on Soviet human rights violations. He also raised the
                            possibility of a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> caucus statement
                            registering the progress made at Madrid, and calling for future
                            consultations, but noted that there were pros and cons to this idea and
                            that the Germans favored separate statements.</p>
                        <p>—Whitney welcomed the opportunity afforded by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> mission to exchange ideas. He
                            voiced <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> support for United States
                            goals. <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> uses every opportunity, in
                            meetings with the Soviets, to press on this issue. The <gloss

                            of the British public to whom the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>

                        <p>—Madrid Ministerial Statements: Whitney agreed with the German view that
                            separate but coordinated statements by ministers would be more
                            appropriate than a joint <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                                statement.<note n="6" xml:id="d64fn6">In telegram 9506 from Madrid,

                            necessarily watered-down, statement agreed upon by all. The large body

                                >NATO</gloss> could be drawn upon in drafting ministers’ remarks.
                            Whitney did not expect great variations in Western governments’ views.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> saw Madrid as a modest
                            achievement, not a major breakthrough. Others might express
                            dissatisfaction with the lack of <pb facs="0247" n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                            /> concrete improvements, especially since 1979, and a wish that more
                            had been achieved.</p>

                            Parliamentary debate on the paper would be initiated by the Foreign

                            a strong US statement should be expected, in order to take full
                            advantage of the forum.</p>
                        <p>—Post-Madrid Consultations: <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                >Stoessel</persName> raised the possibility of using <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> experts meeting, an entirely new Ad
                            Hoc Group, or possibly the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Commission
                            on Human Rights at Geneva, as ways to intensify post-Madrid
                            consultations, recognizing that each forum had its unique shortcomings.
                            Broomfield noted that the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–10 East
                            European Working Group already functioned as a forum for consultation
                            which included the neutrals, as did the European Parliament at
                            Strasbourg. “To put it crudely,” he said, there was a US problem, since
                            the US was not included in these groups. The need now is to key in the
                            US interest, as the US “cutting edge” is crucial for continued
                            achievements in this area. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is an
                            obvious forum. At Madrid, the neutrals and nonaligned have already
                            formed a consultative body that could be an interlocutor for Western
                            countries, either bilaterally or as a group via its chairman. Whitney
                            expressed reluctance to see any new body created especially for the
                            purpose of post-Madrid consultations, but offered to examine all
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>—Broomfield stated that <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Madrid
                            delegate <persName corresp="#p_WG_2">Williams</persName> would be
                            instructed to submit recommendations on the best means of continued
                            consultation, and urged that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1"

                            would study the US non-paper with great interest, and would remain in

                                >FCO</gloss> Officials: Seven British parliamentarians who are
                            especially active on the issue of Soviet human rights abuses welcomed
                            the <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> mission (with
                            acerbic comments by some MP’s on what they saw as <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss>’s lack of enthusiasm in this area) and
                            offered a number of suggestions on tactics. Among them:</p>
                        <p>—Study more thoroughly the underlying reasons for Soviet behavior, so as
                            to achieve more influence over it.</p>
                        <p>—Persuade the Soviets that their interests suffer more from continued
                            human rights abuses than they would from more liberal policies. Use
                            ridicule where appropriate.</p>
                        <p>—Mobilize left-wing Western opinion and Third World (especially Indian)
                            opinion, both of which (in the view of one participant) would be more
                            influential on Soviet policy than Western governmental initiatives.</p>
                        <p>—To maintain Western credibility, apply the same human rights criteria to
                            all countries.</p>
                        <p>—Use economic incentives to encourage human rights improvements.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> Assistant Under-Secretary and
                            former Ambassador to Poland Kenneth James called for a more extensive
                            high-level dialogue with the Soviets to gain a deeper understanding of
                            their thinking, combined with a high level of public pressure on human
                            rights questions. He felt that potential political costs had
                            successfully kept the Soviets out of Poland—and thus preserved a greater
                            degree of freedom for the Poles than would have been the case otherwise.
                            The West did have cards to play and should use them.</p>

                        <p>Fourth, we will be seeking to include <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"

                            human rights situation, to facilitate public discussion in the U.S. of
                            Soviet human rights abuses, and to encourage U.S. groups to work with
                            European counterpart groups on Soviet human rights issues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                        <p>This preliminary game plan gives us a very full plate of follow-up
                            actions to pursue. It should not be expected that all of the proposed
                            actions, particularly those within <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, will be greeted with universal acclaim. However, the
                            long run objective—to energize Allied and neutral governments and
                            publics on Soviet human rights issues—is worth the effort. A
                            successfully pursued strategy could eventually encourage increasing
                            Western European aggressiveness in presenting human rights issues to the
                            Soviets. This would, in turn, add to the political pressure on the
                            Soviets to moderate their human rights abuses to the extent that they
                            valued European opinion.</p>

                        <p>—It can reduce suffering in certain specific cases.</p>
                        <p>—It can help explain to the public why our relationship with the Soviet
                            bloc constitutes a permanent problem—why they are not like us and why
                            there is no simple answer to getting along with them.</p>
                        <p>—Human rights policy can make visible what we have in common with our
                            Western European and Japanese allies, transcending short-term
                            irritations over trade and foreign policy issues.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, a human rights policy can tap the idealism of the American
                            people and use it to reinforce effective foreign policy, reducing the
                            temptation to isolationism.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Potential Dangers of a Human Rights Policy</p>
                        <p>—Such a policy if not carefully designed can harm bilateral
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>—It can impede us in meeting security threats, as in El Salvador.</p>
                        <p>—Because existing legislation and public concern focuses on cases where
                            the U.S. is giving assistance or otherwise involved, there is a real
                            danger that human rights policy will harm friends, but leave enemies
                            unaffected. There is a danger that we will be active not where the
                            problems are most serious, but where we are already at work. Such a
                            process would create a double standard by which similar human rights
                            violations are treated much more severely in friendly countries than in
                            communist countries. (A double standard is also possible in the other
                            direction: to hit communist countries but ignore friends.)</p>
                        <p>—Finally, human rights policy can give opposition groups a means of
                            destabilizing their own governments by provoking the withdrawal of
                            American support.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Limits to Any Human Rights Policy</p>
                        <p>—For no country can human rights be our sole motive. This imperative must
                            always be weighed with other U.S. concerns: security, the economy,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>—The internal practices of states are deeply ingrained, and therefore
                            difficult to change from outside. Our experience in Vietnam and El
                            Salvador has underlined this fact.</p>
                        <p>—Good human rights practices rest on many preconditions and traditions
                            which United States foreign policy cannot create in the short run.</p>
                        <p>—Certain emergency situations almost inevitably result in human rights
                            violations (civil war as in El Salvador, terrorism as in Argentina).</p>
                        <p>—For these reasons, no human rights policy can avoid frequent and
                            tormenting dilemmas for policymakers: what to do about the Nuns’ case in
                            El Salvador, for example.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options for Constructing a Human Rights Policy
                            That Will Minimize Its Potential Disadvantages, and Maximize Its
                            Potential Advantages</p>
                        <p>—One option is to do the minimum required by legislation and by public
                            opinion. This option would evade some difficulties, but does not help
                            with the double standard problem. In fact, it makes this problem worse,
                            because the legislation and public concern disproportionately target
                            friendly countries. This option frustrates, rather than utilizes, the
                            idealism of the American people.</p>
                        <p>—Another option would focus our concern on “basic” human rights, such as
                            freedom from murder or torture. Such a stance would have the advantage
                            that this kind of human rights observance can be demanded nearly
                            everywhere; such rights have fewer preconditions than things such as
                            freedom of the press. This option has the drawback that it emphasizes
                            some of the cases most difficult for our foreign policy, such as El
                            Salvador. The kind of violations this option would concentrate on are
                            often less common in communist countries, because they are no longer
                            needed—the basic repression of the society has been accomplished at an
                            earlier stage. Such totalitarian societies are not in fact better, but
                            this option tends to exonerate them. Finally, both the foregoing options
                            deal only with symptoms—with specific violations of human rights—and not
                            with their causes.</p>
                        <p>—A third option is the two-track policy adopted by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration in October
                                1981,<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">See <ref target="#d54">Document
                                    54</ref>.</note> which calls for us to respond to specific human
                            rights violations in the short term, as during the Carter <pb
                                facs="0254" n="208" xml:id="pg_208"/> Administration, but also to
                            encourage the growth of democracy world-wide over the long term.
                            Accordingly, this policy sees U.S. strength as useful to human rights
                            policy. A further important element of this policy is to report and
                            respond to human rights violations by opposition and guerrilla groups as
                            well as those by governments. This policy is the root of the President’s
                            Westminister Speech, The National Endowment for Democracy, and similar
                            efforts along this line.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages: The non-democratic character of some important Third World
                            allies, the impossibility of democracy in some places (e.g. Zaire), and
                            the incomplete nature of our knowledge about how to encourage
                            democracy.</p>
                        <p>Advantages: This policy correctly understands that specific human rights
                            violations are not an accident; they are symptoms that flow from the
                            underlying political order. Only democracy has proved to be a good
                            guarantee of proper human rights practices. This policy also has the
                            advantage that it takes off part of the pressure to react to human
                            rights violations only in the short term—as in El Salvador—because short
                            term reaction is not all we are doing. Such a policy thus makes it
                            easier to explain apparent inconsistencies in our short term human
                            rights responses.</p>

                            Non-Democratic Regimes?</p>
                        <p>—We ought in time to be able to shape a situation like the one the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> now enjoys: the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is able to work flexibly with
                            non-communist regimes in practice, but without giving up the long term
                            encouragement of communist regimes.</p>
                        <p>—Throughout the world’s nations different categories of human rights
                            violations are combined in many different ways. In the Philippines, for
                            example, there are political killings, but also considerable freedom to
                            oppose the government; in China there are very few killings, but no
                            freedom to oppose the government. Our attitudes thus must be determined
                            on a case by case basis.</p>
                        <p>—In determining our attitude, we will need to raise the following
                            questions: What is the likeliest alternative to a regime? Is it in
                            transition toward democracy? How great are our security interests? (The
                            alliances of the democracies with Stalin and, after Stresa in 1935, with
                            Mussolini against Hitler show the power of security interests, but also
                            their limitations in democratic societies.) How great is our power to
                            change a system? Finally, how great is a regime’s potential for internal
                            change? (Grenada is the first communist regime to be displaced from
                            power since 1919.)</p>

                            Useful Guide?</p>
                        <p>—Advantages: This distinction forces us to think about the result of
                            political changes. It plausibly argues that “authoritarian” govern<pb
                                facs="0255" n="209" xml:id="pg_209"/>ments do not control the whole
                            of society, and that they are usually forced in practice to resort to
                            democratic codes of legitimacy, which may create an opening for
                            democratization.</p>
                        <p>—Disadvantages: This is only one of a number of distinctions necessary to
                            explain human rights behavior. It does not explain, for example, why the
                            Idi Amin regime was as brutal as many totalitarian regimes. The
                            distinction can be misinterpreted as implying that we are less opposed
                            to authoritarian torture than to totalitarian torture. It should always
                            be clear that we react to a given human rights violation with the same
                            seriousness, regardless of its author; the distinction is useful only in

                        <p>—We are obliged by law to use security assistance, economic assistance,
                                <gloss target="#t_MDB_1">MDB</gloss> votes, crime control licensing,
                            and the Human Rights Reports in certain circumstances. All recent
                            administrations have also used some mix of private diplomacy and public
                            comment on abuses.</p>
                        <p>—This administration has generally chosen to use private diplomacy more
                            and public denunciation less, arguing that we should use the instrument
                            most effective in a given case. Traditional diplomacy is obviously more
                            useful where we have a friendly relationship, public statements where
                            our best tool is the mobilization of world opinion—as often in the case
                            of communist regimes. In most cases, it is probably necessary to have
                            some mixture of traditional diplomacy and symbolic affirmation of the
                            U.S. commitment to human rights.</p>

                        <p>—These necessarily arise, due to bureaucratic interests that put
                            bilateral relations before everything, to the variety of conditions, to
                            the variety of appropriate instruments, and to competing foreign policy

                            Will it help to be honest when security considerations take priority, as

                        <p>The Genocide Convention defines the act of genocide, confirms that it is
                            a crime under international law which may be prosecuted in an
                            international penal tribunal, obliges States Parties to enact
                            legislation to make genocide a crime under national law, and specifies
                            that genocide shall not be considered a political offense for the
                            purpose of extradition. The Convention also provides that disputes
                            relating to its interpretation, application or fulfillment shall be
                            submitted to the International Court of Justice.</p>

                        <p>President Truman sent the Convention to the Senate for its advice and
                            consent to ratification in 1949 and it has remained pending in the
                            Senate ever since. More recently Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter
                            endorsed the Convention. On several occasions, the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee has favorably reported out the Convention,<note

                            ratification of the treaty for a number of reasons including: the

                            opposition (although the <gloss target="#t_ABA_1">ABA</gloss> has
                            supported adherence since 1976), initial Senate doubt whether genocide
                            was a proper subject of the treaty making power, and the strenuous
                            opposition of many conservatives on constitutional and other
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>The Genocide Convention has been under Departmental review since the

                            difficult to continue to claim that it is still under study. After
                            having reviewed the legal and policy issues related to the Convention,

                            against its ratification. However, the issue remains whether and on what
                            basis the Administration should endorse its ratification. Informal
                            soundings by <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> indicate that the White

                            raised in the Senate, in addition to the extradition and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> questions addressed by the two
                            proposed reservations. In L’s view, shared by the Department of Justice,
                            the legal and constitutional issues raised in the past have not been
                            well-founded; nevertheless, they may resurface. We intend to try to
                            deflect them by proposing reservations which would demonstrate our
                            willingness to anticipate and deal sensibly with concerns on extradition
                            and the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> that have previously been
                            raised.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option 2: Administration Support for the Convention
                                Without Proposing Reservations</hi></p>
                        <p>Given the large number of objections to the Convention that have been
                            raised in the past, it may be advisable for the Administration not to
                            propose reservations at the time it expresses support for the
                            Convention. Instead, the Administration, while supporting ratification
                            of the Convention, could note that a number of objections have been
                            raised about the Convention and could express a serious intent to give
                            full consideration to any reservations that members of the Senate may
                            consider necessary in order to give their advice and consent. By
                            demonstrating recognition of the need to accommodate their views, this
                            approach might blunt some negative reactions from the President’s
                            supporters who now oppose the Convention, although it might also be
                            interpreted as an invitation to critics of the Convention to deluge it
                            with reservations. Nonetheless, this approach could be portrayed to
                            supporters as a serious effort to secure ratification as opposed to the
                            sort of posturing in which past Administrations have engaged. In
                            addition, it would allow the President and high ranking Department
                            officers more flexibility in deciding how visible they would be in the
                            process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option 3: Maintain the Status Quo</hi></p>
                        <p>From time to time, the White House and the Department receive inquiries
                            from members of Congress and the public concerning our stance on the
                            Convention. H notes that despite occasional inquiries, there is no
                            noticeable Congressional pressure for ratification. In addition, each
                            January, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requests an official
                            statement of the Administration’s views on each treaty still pending
                            with the Senate. In each case, this Administration has replied that the
                            Convention and other “human rights” treaties are “under review.”
                            Maintenance of this posture is increasingly awkward, although it does
                            avoid potential conflict with Administration supporters who have opposed
                            the Convention and would not be mollified by reservations.</p>

                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName>, January 18, 1984.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> said that he had not
                            consented to all the specific issues mentioned by the Secretary, but, as
                            he had said, the two broad areas for discussion would be the
                            international situation and bilateral relations. He thought that, as he
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>, this was the
                            direction in which the discussions should go. He noted that the
                            Secretary had named a number of other items, among them, for example,
                            human rights. Since the Secretary had named this matter, he would tell
                            him at the very outset of their discussion that he did not intend to
                            discuss <pb facs="0260" n="214" xml:id="pg_214"/> any such topic. Of
                            course, the Secretary could talk about it if he insisted, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> would not enter into
                            discussion of this item.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that of course it would be up to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> whether he would wish to
                            respond to something the Secretary would say. That was <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName>’s privilege. But the Secretary
                            said that he must make some comments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> repeated that he would
                            tell the Secretary at the very outset that he would not enter into
                            discussion of this topic. The two of them already had some experience
                            when one side does not wish to discuss some specific issue. He would
                            only say again that he would not discuss this item because the Soviet
                            Union would not allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs. To
                            raise this issue would therefore be an evident waste of time. Surely it
                            would be too much of a luxury for foreign ministers to lose time on that
                            sort of item. As for himself he had no wish to lose time. As for the
                            Secretary, he could of course do so, but without <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName>’s participation. He would
                            suggest that the Secretary feel free to speak on the two items named,
                            i.e. the international situation and bilateral issues. Or, if the
                            Secretary preferred, <persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName>
                            would lead off and talk on our bilateral relations. He thought that
                            neither of them would feel constrained and they would have enough room
                            to exchange views, particularly about the Stockholm Conference. At the
                            Conference the Secretary had expressed the views of the U.S.
                            Administration and today <persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName>
                            had expressed the views of the Soviet Government and the Soviet
                            leadership. He thought it would not be superfluous if he said something
                            in addition to what he had stated publicly.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2"

                        <p>These were some of the comments the Secretary wanted to make with
                            reference to the various forums in which the topics <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> had properly identified as
                            matters of concern in our country and in the world would be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> said that first of all,
                            he wanted to reply to one of the questions the Secretary had touched on
                            at the beginning of their talk today. The Secretary had raised the
                            question of human rights, blowing it out of all proportion. He would say
                            that the Secretary was probably well aware of the Soviet appraisal of
                            his entire position on this question. <persName corresp="#p_GDP_2"
                                >Gromyko</persName> was convinced that the U.S. position on this
                            subject was entirely pervaded by falsehood, and that the U.S. was
                            exploiting this matter for propaganda purposes. In essence, the Soviet
                            position was more or less generally shared in the world, and it was that
                            nowhere <pb facs="0261" n="215" xml:id="pg_215"/> else were human rights
                            violated so much as in some of the places in the Western hemisphere that
                            were so dear to U.S. hearts, not to mention in the U.S. itself.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> said he would ask the
                            Secretary not to ask him to be more precise; he could of course be more
                            precise, but he did not believe he should waste time on this matter. If
                            he were to talk on this subject he would only restate his assessment of
                            the human rights situation as it existed in the United States. The
                            Secretary had spoken of the importance of people moving across borders,
                            the importance of reunifying families, etc., but he would simply point
                            out that he did not know of a single instance where these matters had
                            caused wars to break out. The Soviet Union was unshakeable in that
                            position. He would not want to devote any time to the details of these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was surprised that it was <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> who had raised the subject of
                            human rights. He was ready to discuss this topic and there were a few
                            comments he wanted to make:</p>
                        <p>—First, the Secretary wanted to express his admiration for the Soviet
                            Union for taking a decision on the Pentecostal families.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d68fn3">The Soviet Government permitted the emigration of 15
                                additional Pentecostals in June 1983. See John F. Burns, “15

                            The decision had been up to the Soviet Union, and it had been made. It
                            showed that progress was possible.</p>
                        <p>—Second, he wanted to say that with reference to individual issues,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> preferred a
                            process of quiet diplomacy in this area.</p>
                        <p>—Third, he wanted to mention the cases of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Shcharanskiy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1"

                            States.</p>
                        <p>—Further, he would also mention a subject we had discussed with the
                            Soviets many times: the question of Jewish emigration from the Soviet
                            Union and its radical decline in recent years.</p>
                        <p>—He also wanted to note that Edgar Bronfman, President of the World

                            meeting in New York he, in the usual practice, had given the Soviet side
                            a list of people who claimed U.S. citizenship under our laws, but had
                            been refused permission to leave the Soviet Union. He would like
                            Ambassador Hartman to provide Minister Korniyenko with an updated list
                            of such cases, and also lists of persons seeking to join members of

                            human rights agenda continues to be highly selective in its
                            concentration upon only a few Latin American countries, the agenda of
                            the Human Rights Commission has in recent years taken on a broader
                            focus. The Commission will continue its consideration of the human
                            rights situations in the Israeli-occupied territories, South Africa,
                            Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala; it will also examine the human rights
                            situations in Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Poland and Iran. Our delegation
                            has set for itself two major priorities, (a) the adoption of another
                            resolution on the human rights situation in Poland calling for the
                            preparation of a report by a Special Rapporteur, and (b) the approval of
                            a balanced, factual resolution on the human rights situation in El
                            Salvador which avoids the political extremes which have characterized
                            the resolutions adopted at the last two Commission sessions.</p>

                        <p>Other issues which the United States delegation intends to highlight are

                            Finally, our delegation will try to negotiate with the African
                            delegations the text of a resolution on <hi rend="italic">apartheid</hi>

                            allies on Soviet human rights performance (the first mission took place
                            July 4–14, 1983). This leg of the mission included visits to
                            Switzerland, West Germany, Denmark and France. Ambassador <persName

                            that at this stage there was little outsiders could do to influence the
                            overall course of events within the Soviet Union, though there were
                            still limited possibilities for quiet diplomacy on specific cases. All
                            felt it was important to keep the issue of Soviet human rights
                            violations before the international public. Finally, all agreed that the
                            West should work to prevent the Soviets from shifting the focus of

                        <p>Two new ideas emerged during Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                >Stoessel</persName>’s consultations. The first came from the Swiss,
                            who said they were planning to propose at the Ottawa Human Rights
                            Experts Meeting in May 1985 that the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> countries should form a “human rights mechanism” in
                            each country, modeled fairly closely on the State Department’s Bureau of
                            Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which would enable the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> countries to consult bilaterally and
                            multilaterally on human rights issues of interest. We made the obvious
                            points that the Warsaw Pact countries would be driven up the wall by
                            this proposal, and that there was a reluctance on the part of many
                            Western countries (notably the French) to establish new mechanisms of
                            this type. However, we also agreed that the idea deserved a good deal
                            more study, and encouraged the Swiss to pursue their investigations.

                        <p>In recent months a variety of groups and individuals have written to the
                            President or to senior staff members of the White House to urge
                            Administration support for Senate ratification of the Genocide
                            Convention. These have included a letter (dated April 12, 1984) to the

                        <p>The Genocide Convention has been pending before the Senate for 35 years,
                            and ratification has been supported by Presidents Truman, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JG_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>, Nixon, and Carter. The Senate Foreign Relations
                            Committee last reported the treaty out in 1976 with three understandings
                            and one declaration.<note n="5" xml:id="d72fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d67fn3">footnote 3, Document 67</ref>.</note> Due to
                            opposition from various groups, the treaty was never brought to a vote
                            on the floor.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, opposition to the Genocide Convention has diminished. The
                            American Bar Association, which until the 1970s was opposed to the
                            treaty, is now a very strong supporter. Moreover, conservative
                            opposition has diminished, and senators such as Lugar and <pb
                                facs="0268" n="222" xml:id="pg_222"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAL_2">Armstrong</persName> have privately said
                            they would support ratification under appropriate circumstances. The
                            core opposition now appears to be limited to Senators Thurmond, East,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HJA_1">Helms</persName>, and the Liberty
                            Lobby. Jewish groups have long urged ratification.</p>
                        <p>We consider that our technical questions about the treaty can be cured by
                            the three understandings and one declaration that the Committee approved
                            in 1976. The Committee’s position, which we endorse, was even more
                            restrictive than that taken by the Nixon Administration.</p>
                        <p>The key argument against presidential support for ratification at this
                            time is political. The Administration might be accused of a cynical
                            electoral ploy, in submitting the treaty too late for action during the
                            President’s entire term after sitting on it for three and a half years;
                            as noted, a few conservatives would oppose ratification on substantive
                            grounds. The key argument in favor of an announcement of presidential
                            support for ratification at this time is in essence defensive. It is not
                            urged that the Administration would gain a great deal by announcing
                            support, but rather that a failure to support the treaty might well be
                            denounced as an extreme position at variance with those of most
                            preceding presidents including President Nixon. Moreover, the treaty is
                            substantively acceptable and there is increasing pressure for the
                            Administration to take a position on it.</p>
                        <p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have made it clear to us that
                            the treaty cannot be considered this year, and we could seek to defer
                            the holding of a hearing on the treaty if we felt such a hearing would
                            be controversial. The Department recommends that the President announce
                            support for ratification, as part of his overall human rights policy, at
                            whatever time the President may consider appropriate.<note n="6"

                            Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican diplomat emphasized that “the
                            Soviets are extremely sensitive and mistrustful. If pushed too hard,
                            they will react negatively because of this insecurity.” Casaroli
                            indicated “the mood in Poland as one of resignation and silent,
                            unenthusiastic agreement” and added that “the Poles are more concerned
                            with economics and daily life.” (Telegram 22253 from Rome, September 10;

                            with Norwegian Foreign Minister Svenn Stray. Stray stressed that while
                            he agreed that greater multilateral coordination on human rights issues
                            should occur, the Norweigian Government “preferred to emphasize
                            pragmatic approaches rather than public posturing and that the West
                            should focus on the rights of individuals rather than upon attempting to
                            alter Soviet society.” Stray suggested allowing non-members of the
                            Council of Europe, such as Canada and the United States, to participate

                        <p>On September 14, <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName> met
                            with Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and stressed the importance of
                            injecting a “humanizing influence into Soviet thinking.” Palme replied
                            that he felt “pessimistic about the present trend of tightening up [on
                            human rights] in the Soviet Union,” adding “The Soviets seem insensitive
                            right now to what others say; they have internal problems and are
                            tightening their grip, and moreover they believe they can’t get anything
                            from the West now anyway.” Palme criticized U.S human rights policy,
                            stating, “You don’t care about human rights in your own orbit,” and
                            rejecting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Jeanne
                                Kirkpatrick</persName>’s distinction between authoritarian and
                            totalitarian states. Palme added, “Your position would be better if you
                            showed you care about human rights outside of the Soviet empire.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMM_1">Kampelman</persName> stated that “while
                            Pinochet’s policies are deplorable—and indeed we are doing what we can
                            to improve them—they do not threaten the peace of the world. Because
                            they affect the overall East-West relationship, Soviet human rights
                            violations do, and that is why we are concentrating on them.” (Telegram

                            particularly the question of Soviet Jewry. The Secretary expressed his
                            view that if we were to establish a better working relationship with the
                            Soviet Union, the chances are that the Soviets would be willing to see
                            more Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union. He said that at one point
                                <persName corresp="#p_GDP_2">Gromyko</persName> had as much as told
                            him so. But he thought that in any event it was likely to be so because
                            the <pb facs="0272" n="226" xml:id="pg_226"/> Soviets seemed to be using

                            text of the convention is identical to the draft convention submitted by

                            implementation) and a new Article 28 which expressly provides that
                            states can make reservations about Article 20 at the time of

                            concessions which were considered necessary by the main proponents of
                            the convention, which weaken its implementation mechanism, we regard the
                            consensus adoption of the convention (following informal consultations
                            under Dutch Chairmanship) as a major achievement of the 39th <gloss

                            working group, sought by convention opponents such as the <gloss

                            bury the draft convention for several years and finally to produce a
                            significantly inferior text. As adopted, the convention provides for a
                            system of universal criminal jurisdiction in cases of torture and it
                            establishes an expert committee against torture to monitor
                            implementation of the convention by states parties. In Article 20, it
                            includes the most far-reaching mandatory implementation mechanism which
                            is an integral part of any international human rights instrument; this
                            represents a small but significant step forward in the development of
                            international human rights law. <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>

                            approaches to host governments. The Department is requested to explore
                            the possibility of signing the convention and submitting it to the

                                the convention was approved without a vote as part of a compromise

                        <p>4. (U) Essentially, the compromise involves two matters of substance. A
                            revision to Article 19 of the convention will limit the mandate of the
                            newly created Committee Against Torture to making “general comments on
                            the report” submitted to it by each state party, instead of making
                            “comments or suggestions” as stipulated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss> draft. A new Article 28 will allow
                            states to make a reservation at the time of ratification to the effect
                            that they do not recognize the competence of the Committee Against
                            Torture to initiate its own inquiries whenever it receives “reliable

                            has been ratified by 20 states. <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>
                            believes that there would be significant advantages to ratifying the
                            convention before it enters into force, so that the U.S. will have a
                            voice in development of the machinery and a vote in the first election
                            to the Committee Against Torture. We fully appreciate that the
                            Department and other relevant executive departments will need to review
                            the final text of the convention before deciding whether to sign it and
                            seek ratification. However, we note that both Houses of Congress
                            unanimously expressed general support for the draft convention in a
                            joint resolution which was signed by the President on October 4, 1984
                            (Public Law 98–447). The Department is requested to consider the
                            possibility of signing the Convention Against Torture and submitting it
                            to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification at an early date.

                        <p>The basic point I made at our meeting last week is that it is now clear
                            that the Soviet Union under <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> will be aggressive rather than defensive in
                            the area of human rights.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">No record of this
                                meeting was found.</note> There is no doubt that we can deal
                            effectively with this new aggressive stance. However, more than ever
                            before, we need an overall strategy on how to deal with what is
                            essentially the political and public diplomacy aspect of the <pb
                                facs="0275" n="229" xml:id="pg_229"/> human rights situation in the
                            Soviet Union. This encompasses not only conditions in the Soviet Union,
                            but also Afghanistan, repression by the satellites at Soviet behest, and
                            the various issues raised by the Soviets in their efforts to embarrass
                            us, including the right to peace, economic rights, El Salvador, etc.</p>
                        <p>What I would recommend is that an overarching strategy be developed that
                            would be reflected in our pronouncements in the various relevant United
                            Nations fora, particularly the United Nations Human Rights Commission,
                            and in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> fora, and for which we
                            would actively engage <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> support. I
                            would further recommend that rather than waiting for time to get close
                            to a particular international meeting before we gear up for the event in
                            question we engage in a continuing effort, keeping future international
                            meetings and their potential publicity value well in mind.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the point I have just made, let me suggest the following

                            Kooijmans, a Professor of Law at the University of Leyden, was appointed
                            to this position. As Soviet abuse of psychiatry is unquestionably a form
                            of torture, I believe that Kooijmans should be urged to include a report
                            on Soviet psychiatry in his submission to the Human Rights Commission
                            next year. We ought to encouarge the American Psychiatric Association to
                            submit material to Kooijmans and for that Association to organize other
                            psychiatric groups around the world to be in touch with Kooijmans.</p>
                        <p>(2) The position of Rapporteur on Torture was established in light of the
                            adoption of the Torture Convention.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d76">Document 76</ref>.</note> In view of the fact that
                            in 1981 the United Nations adopted a Declaration against Religious
                            Intolerance, there would be logic in establishing a further Rapporteur’s
                            position, that of Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance. We have suggested
                            to the Belgians,<note n="5" xml:id="d77fn5">No record of this was
                                found.</note> who are joining the Commission as new members, to take
                            the lead on this subject and they have agreed. However, it is necessary
                            to provide comprehensive support for them. Furthermore, thought should
                            be given as to who might be an appropriate Rapporteur. At the present
                            time the Human Rights Commission does not have any Rapporteurs from
                            Asia. An Asian would, therefore, be considered an <pb facs="0276"
                                n="230" xml:id="pg_230"/> appropriate choice. My recommendation
                            would be that we support Ambassador Moreno-Salcedo of the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>(3) We should make a major effort at the next session of the Commission
                            to end the special U.N. monitoring of El Salvador.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d77fn6">See <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> In
                            order to accomplish that result at the Commission, it is also necessary
                            to try to get the United Nations General Assembly to approve a
                            resolution on El Salvador which foreshadows the termination of that
                            country’s special status at the next Commission session.</p>
                        <p>(4) For years the Soviet bloc, led by Cuba, has used the “Right to

                            in particular. As indicated in the letter which I have sent to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>, I recommend that we
                            go along with the Yugoslav declaration on the Right to Development and
                            that we then use this issue in a manner similar to our use of it in

                        <p>(5) At the next Human Rights Commission session the Soviet Union will
                            undoubtedly harp again on the “Right to Life” issue, which is its way of
                            introducing disarmament into the human rights debate. In past years we
                            have not made a major effort on this topic at the Human Rights
                            Commission. I would suggest that next year we engage in a detailed
                            analysis of the Soviet Union’s role in the arms race and that we
                            distribute a brochure on that subject.</p>

                            Here it would be my suggestion that we begin now to prepare for Berne
                            and Vienna and that we do so by encouraging our <gloss

                            to sway Western audiences with clever propaganda arguments. In comparing
                            the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union with that in other countries,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> overstated his

                            also disappointed Western observers by his public attack on <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s blunt, almost brutal
                            approach to human rights is consistent with the overall pattern of
                            Soviet policy in recent years. The Soviets have intensified the
                            repression of dissidents and have cut back on the numbers of Jews,
                            ethnic Germans, and Armenians granted permission to leave the Soviet
                            Union. The Soviets have been unresponsive to Western demands that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Shcharanskiy</persName>, <persName

                            few signs of wanting a breakthrough on this issue, the possibility that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> will try to
                            influence the pre- or post-meeting atmosphere by a major human rights

                        <p>The one area of human rights on which <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> has shown some flexibility is that of family
                            reunification, which can be portrayed as an “administrative” rather than
                            a “political” issue. Discussing family reunification cases with the U.S.
                            does not require the Soviets to concede even implicitly that they
                            obstruct emigration or unjustly persecute Soviet citizens. In any case,
                            the Soviets can block the emigration of particular individuals by
                            claiming that they had access to “state secrets.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Jewish Emigration</p>
                        <p>Jewish emigration from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has
                            declined from over 51,000 in the peak year of 1979 to 896 in 1984. The
                            drastic decline has been accompanied by an increase in the intensity and
                            a change in the character of official repression of Soviet Jews. The
                            most striking feature of the present campaign of repression has been the
                            arrest and imprisonment (on various pretexts) of teachers of Hebrew.
                            Alarmed at these developments, Soviet Jews have looked to the West for
                            support and have urged the world Jewish community to use “quiet
                            diplomacy” in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on
                            the emigration issue.</p>
                        <p>The way in which the Soviets have responded to Western and Israeli
                            attempts to raise the issue of Jewish emigration strongly suggests that
                            the current Soviet leadership believes it can exploit concerns about
                            Soviet Jewry for foreign policy purposes. At a minimum, the Soviet
                            leadership would like to eliminate emigration as a subject of
                                U.S.–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> government-to-government
                            discussion and transfer the issue to private, non-publicized channels.
                            This would help to prevent U.S. administrations from “linking” trade and
                            other issues to emigration.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Soviet leaders hope that a subtle policy of carrots and
                            sticks toward Israel and the world Jewish community will succeed in
                            defusing Jewish emigration as an international political issue. Soviet
                            officials traveling in the West have hinted that direct emigration
                            flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv could result if French Jewish groups

                            President stressed that he did not want to interfere in the internal
                            affairs of the Soviet Union, but he did want to speak with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> about human rights.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">In the left-hand margin, an unknown hand
                                wrote, “<gloss target="#t_HR_1">HR</gloss>.”</note></p>
                        <p>The President indicated that in the U.S. system of government many of the
                            things that we would hope to accomplish with the Soviet Union would
                            require the support of the Congress, which, in turn, is influenced by
                            the people of the country. He could get such support if some things were
                            done in the area of human rights. In the U.S., as <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> knew, we have people from
                            all over the world. Many of them retain a pride in their heritage, with
                            regard to the countries where their parents and ancestors came from.</p>
                        <p>The President said that religious groups in the U.S. tend to influence
                            Congress through lobby groups. An example of strong attachment to <pb
                                facs="0284" n="238" xml:id="pg_238"/> religious celebration occurred
                            in the U.S. on St. Patrick’s Day. This was a special holiday for the
                            Irish, and <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s father had
                            come from Ireland. Other groups in the U.S., such as Ukrainian
                            Americans, Lithuanian Americans and Polish Americans have their
                            organizations, customs and holidays.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he did not wish to raise this issue in the main
                            meeting. He was also not asking to get <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>’s agreement to publicly announce actions which
                            were being taken to deal with difficulties in this area, such as
                            emigration. The recent release of several men and women who were allowed
                            to join their spouses had made a big impact on the people in the U.S.,
                            but the President wished to be frank and said that the question then
                            arose—why not the rest? An example of such an issue was the desire of
                            Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. There was a large Jewish community in
                            the U.S., which had an influence on Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> that
                            if he could resolve some of these issues on his own, the President would
                            never boast that the Soviet side had given in to the U.S. We would
                            express our appreciation for what was done, and there would be no hint
                            that this was done as a result of U.S. efforts. But the fact that
                            something was done would make it easier for the President to do the type
                            of things which the two countries could do together, such as in the area
                            of trade, for which the President needed Congressional support.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he wished to give an example of this type of
                            approach. In 1981, during his first year in office, the Soviet
                            government was eager to have a new long-term grain agreement with the
                            U.S., after the imposition of the grain embargo by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s predecessor. The President
                            had sat down with the Soviet Ambassador and had spoken with him about
                            human rights concerns, citing the specific example of the
                            Pentecostalists who had been living for five years in the basement of
                            the Moscow Embassy. If they had left the Embassy, they would have been
                            taken by the police. They had come to the Embassy because they had
                            gotten into trouble after having asked for permission to emigrate. The
                            President told the Ambassador that he would not speak publicly about
                            this, but there would be a better chance to have a grain agreement,
                            since there was opposition in the U.S. to such an agreement, if
                            something were done to free those people. Shortly after that, they left
                            the Embassy and emigrated to the U.S. The President never told anyone
                            that he had done this. Those people were gratefully received in the
                            U.S., and they did not even know that the President had spoken on their
                            behalf. A short time later, the long-term grain agreement was concluded
                            without difficulties in Congress, and this agreement is in place
                            today.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that this was the type of thing which he was
                            seeking here and that is why he did not wish to raise these issues <pb
                                facs="0285" n="239" xml:id="pg_239"/> in the full meeting, not to
                            make it appear that he was trying to interfere in the internal affairs
                            of the Soviet Union. It would make it easier for us to do the type of
                            things that we could do together if he were not constantly reminded
                            about the restrictions imposed on Soviet people, the refusal to permit
                            them to practice their religion, etc. The President would not tell
                            anyone that he had raised this issue with <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            replied that he considered that at some stage of U.S.-Soviet relations,
                            the issue of human rights was being used for political purposes, not
                            only by representatives of various political organizations which were
                            anti-Soviet, but, and this came as a surprise, also by officials of the
                            U.S. Administration, including the President. The Soviet side did not
                            understand this. The President had mentioned why and how he had come to
                            be involved in these issues. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> wished to say in all sincerity that the Soviet
                            Union was in favor of broader contacts, exchange of people—scientists,
                            cultural representatives, all types of people—with the U.S. The Soviet
                            side felt that this was necessary, and <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> had said the same. The two countries depended on
                            each other today and would in the future. We should get to know each
                            other better and create a good atmosphere. The Soviet people have no
                            enmity for the American people. The Soviet people have a positive
                            attitude toward the people of the United States. If we work at this on
                            the basis of non-interference in the internal affairs of the other
                            country, the Soviet side would be ready to broaden its contacts with the
                            U.S. It is truly interested in doing so. But what we need first is an
                            atmosphere of good will between the countries. This was the fundamental
                            question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> then went on to give
                            specific examples. People from the U.S. travel to the Soviet Union and
                            vice versa. People in the U.S. have relatives in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and they come visit the places of
                            their origin, such as the Ukraine, the Baltic States, and so on. The
                            Soviet Union welcomes this and is open to such visits. There are no
                            difficulties in this regard. Lately, there has been an increase in
                            contacts between representatives of religious groups. The Soviet side
                            was in favor of this. There were marriages between U.S. and Soviet
                            citizens. This was a very natural and understandable thing, and there
                            were no objections to this. Since the group of U.S. Senators that had
                            met with him before this meeting in Geneva had mentioned these issues,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> had looked into
                            them. During the past five years more than 400 marriages had taken
                            place, and out of these, only ten people had not been permitted to
                            emigrate. The only obstacle to emigration is involvement of the person
                            in question with state secrets. In this case, the state has a specific
                            responsibility, but it tries to let time pass, to let the individual do
                            different kind of work so that his knowledge becomes outdated. His case
                            is then returned too, and he is released. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> repeated that <pb facs="0286" n="240"
                                xml:id="pg_240"/> within the past five years restrictions had been
                            placed only on ten of 420 to 450 people. But these were Soviet
                            regulations, and the Soviet side asked that they be respected. This was
                            one example.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> continued that the
                            President had mentioned Jews. The fate of Jewish people was of concern
                            to the Soviet government. There are many Jews in the Soviet Union, as
                            there are in the U.S. (which has the greatest number) and in other
                            countries. After what the Fascists had done to the Jews, the Soviet
                            Union had done everything it could to give them special attention, and
                            it had not regretted doing so. Since many Jewish families had been
                            separated, difficulties existed because of this, and the Soviet side
                            tried to examine such cases. But when such issues are mixed in with
                            discussion of the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union in general,
                            this is not right. Then the Soviet side objects and furnishes data to
                            back up what it says. This has been the Soviet Union’s approach in all
                            cases, including in its discussions with the U.S. The Soviet Union was
                            willing to look at specific cases, but when these things are used for
                            political aims, they would be rebuffed. Specific cases would be examined
                            quietly, in a humane way.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> said that when a U.S.
                            Congressional delegation had visited the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> at the invitation of the Supreme Soviet, the two
                            bodies had agreed to establish a permanent group to examine such issues,
                            and the Soviet side was in favor of this, but would not permit this
                            issue to be used for political aims.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that with regard to Jews and
                            other religious groups, there were restrictions in the Soviet Union on
                            their ability to practice their religion, e.g., Jews were not permitted
                            to teach Hebrew. In the U.S., in addition to attending the usual
                            schools, Jewish families sent their children to their own schools to
                            study their ancient language. Perhaps some people would not think of
                            emigrating from the Soviet Union if they were allowed to practice their
                            religion.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that with regard to other questions, the two
                            countries had signed the Helsinki Accords which assured certain
                            freedoms, such as family reunification and the right to emigrate.
                            However, our two countries were big ones, with very large bureaucracies.
                            It was not possible for <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> or the President to know everything that went
                            on at the lower levels, where people could make decisions which were
                            contrary to the desires of the leadership.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>
                            had mentioned that only ten people had not been permitted to rejoin
                            their spouses. But he had a much larger list of cases of separate
                            families. He also wished to give <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> one more example of a case in this category.
                            He knew of a piano player, a young man in the Soviet Union, who wished
                            to emigrate to Israel. Not only was he denied such permission, but he
                            was also denied permission to play the piano with major orchestras, <pb
                                facs="0287" n="241" xml:id="pg_241"/> and his records could no
                            longer be sold in stores. His career had been destroyed as a result of
                            the fact that he had wished to emigrate. The bureaucracy could do many
                            things of which <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> was
                            not aware. This man had a wife and a small child. Apparently, he and his
                            wife had been told that they could emigrate, but the baby would have to
                            remain. Since the child was only one year old, they certainly could not
                            have left him behind, so they did not emigrate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            said that he would like to ask the President about the following. For
                            the Soviet leadership and for everyone in Soviet society it was clear
                            whose side the President was on in the area of human rights. The
                            President always spoke of the lack of human rights in socialist
                            countries. In other countries there was democracy and everything was
                            okay. Since people were aware of the rights situation in the Soviet
                            Union and in other countries, and could compare the situations, why was
                            the President taking this point of view. If other people said this, this
                            might be understandable, but the President always said that there is a
                            clear distinction, namely, that there are no rights in socialist
                            countries, but they are in bloom in the democracies. This caused
                            consternation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> continued that at the
                            level of General Secretary and President one should be responsible and
                            call things by their proper names, no matter where they occur. If things
                            are painted only in black and white, this would only inflame the
                            distrust between the countries. He thought that it would be better to
                            take steps to improve the general atmosphere of our relationship, and
                            then specific humanitarian issues could quickly be resolved. The Soviet
                            Union was prepared to resolve them. But if questions of human rights
                            were used for political purposes, the Soviet side would rebuff such
                            attempts. He repeated that the Soviet Union was ready to examine
                            specific cases, especially those mentioned by the President.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> replied that he was trying to
                            clearly indicate that if such changes occurred, he would not indicate
                            that he was the one that had persuaded <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> to do this. He realized that both of them had
                            concerns about their political image, namely, that they did not want to
                            have it seen that they were giving in to outside influences. He wished
                            to assure <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> that he
                            would have no such problems with the President. What happens is that
                            various groups in the United States have relatives and families in other
                            countries, and they get information from these people. Then
                            organizations deliver this to the President and demand that their
                            grievances be resolved with regard to people in the Soviet Union. These
                            things make their way into the press, and he could not do anything about
                            that since the U.S. has a free press. He was trying to say that we could
                            work better together if such issues did not appear on the front pages,
                            but rather if he spoke with <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> about these things confidentially.</p>
                        <pb facs="0288" n="242" xml:id="pg_242"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            replied that he welcomed the President’s decision to have such a private
                            meeting. He had heard him out, and the President had heard him out as
                            well, and the two of them would bear in mind what had been said.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> indicated that he would like to make
                            one last point. With regard to what <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> had said about issues like this in the U.S.,
                            the President wished to say that in the U.S. there are laws which
                            prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, national origin, sex
                            and race.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            interjected that he was familiar with the state of things in the U.S.
                            The President had said that there was no discrimination on the basis of
                            sex. This was not true. According to U.S. law a woman could make 60
                            percent of the salary a man made for the same job. The President had
                            spoken of equality. But so much time had passed since the American
                            Revolution, and women still did not have the same rights as men. He knew
                            this to be the case. He was informed. He had a legal education. The
                            President should not think that he saw only the negative aspects of
                            things in a primitive way. He saw things from a broad perspective, and
                            he was responsible. He supported the rights of families. If there was a
                            need, we should have exchanges and see what could be done about specific
                            problems. But if we are referring to changing laws, with other interests
                            in mind, this could not be done. The Soviet people set their laws. Any
                            other approach shows a disrespect for the Soviet people. This must be
                            the basic framework. The U.S. had its own system, and the Soviet Union
                            had its own. The President would defend the United States, and he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>, would defend the
                            Soviet Union. Such a discussion could take a very long time.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> replied that there were differences
                            in our economic system and in our societies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> had mentioned the question
                            of women’s rights. The President noted parenthetically that women own
                            more than 50 percent of all the wealth in the United States. But the
                            difference in the systems was that, yes, there were individuals, perhaps
                            employers in factories, with personal prejudices about hiring women,
                            blacks, and so on. But the law says that there can be no discrimination.
                            So when various groups indicate that there are those who discriminate,
                            the government must abide by the law and punish those individuals. No
                            U.S. law permits discrimination—quite the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that he had spoken about the bureaucracy. He
                            wished to recall that when he was Governor, he learned from one of his
                            assistants that the latter had taken some young black people to the
                            State Labor office to fill out some job applications (the President
                            explained that there was a Department of Labor in California, which
                            helped people to find jobs). When the applicants had subsequently <pb
                                facs="0289" n="243" xml:id="pg_243"/> been questioned about whether
                            they had filled out the applications correctly, one said that he had
                            not. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s assistant took the
                            man back and asked to see his application. They could not find it. Then
                            the man to whom they had been talking slowly edged over to the
                            wastebasket and pulled the application out of it. The Governor was not
                            the one responsible for this. It was one prejudiced clerk who had thrown
                            the application into the wastebasket.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            said that people in the U.S. should live as they like. If they choose
                            something, the Soviets would not judge them. The U.S. had many
                            achievements, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would not
                            interfere in its internal affairs. But the U.S. should do the same with
                            regard to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that it would be easier for him
                            to fulfill some of the possible agreements between the two countries if
                            he were not beset by people in the U.S. Congress and by organizations
                            that hear of their relatives and friends and complain about the
                            restraints which they consider should not be imposed upon them, such as
                            with respect to the right to live in other places or the right to
                            emigrate. So if <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> would
                            think about these things, the President would have more freedom to work
                            together.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            said that he had heard the President’s thoughts, but he could not agree
                            that the President was so dependent on the opinion of small groups. He
                            knew what the President could do as a political leader when he wanted
                            to. When he did not want to, he would talk about pressure groups, and so
                            on. The Soviet side saw all of this. It had a realistic view of life,
                            and asked the U.S. side to have a realistic view of the <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that he realized that it was
                            difficult for the General Secretary, within his system, to believe the

                            was wrong about the President’s power. In the U.S. system, including
                            during the time after he had become President, one part of the Congress,
                            i.e., the House of Representatives, was dominated by the opposition
                            party.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            interrupted, without listening to the translation, to say that he had
                            understood what the President had said, and that he took all of this
                            into account. He was familiar with the American political process, and
                            the President should not hide behind this. (U.S. Interpreter’s Note:
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s indication that
                            he had understood what the President had said without translation was
                            unexpected, since he had never shown any indication of understanding
                            English in previous or subsequent conversations. After the President’s
                            following remarks, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>
                            specifically asked for interpretation and looked like he had not
                            understood what the President had said. I think that the first time he
                            was simply assuming that he knew what the President was saying, and was
                            anxious to get into the plenary meeting.)</p>

                            issues, they would know what the other one looked like, and the image of

                            rights. The President has evidently taken the position that we should
                            adopt a policy of quiet diplomacy in dealing with Soviet human rights
                                cases.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">In an October 29 interview with

                        <p>Human rights is at the heart of our ideological differences with the
                            Soviet Union. The foregoing statement, it seems to me, makes it clear
                            that by committing himself to quiet diplomacy on human rights cases, the
                            President did not intend for us to consider ourselves muzzled in any
                            discussion of the systemic shortcomings of the Soviet Union in the human
                            rights area, nor to give any impression that we are becoming less
                            vigilant in our role as a leading defender of universal human rights. To
                            be sure, our discussion should not be shrill and undignified. We could
                            speak more in sorrow than in anger. But we would, I hope, not hesitate
                            to lay before the world the fundamental defects of the Soviet system. (I
                            am certain that they will not stop laying before the world their
                            negative views of our socio-economic system.)</p>

                            predecessors, they encountered, in most cases, greater Western
                            opposition. Soviet bloc initiatives which bear watching in the future
                            include: two consensus resolutions on <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            work in the field of social development and on the convention against
                            genocide; one on the “indivisibility” of economic, social, cultural,
                            civil and political rights (adopted over a U.S. negative vote); and a
                            draft resolution on “exploitation” of human rights issues. The latter
                            draft did not come to a vote owing largely to opposition from the Third
                            World.</p>
                        <p>5. We presented our views on racism, self-determination, social and
                            women’s issues, refugee and narcotic drug matters, and a range of human
                            rights questions. The following report summarizes Third Committee

                            resolutions adopted, Soviet draft on “inadmissibility” deferred:</p>
                        <p>Despite concerted and vigorous lobbying by the Soviet bloc and Iran, the
                            committee broke new ground at the 40th <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> by adopting resolutions on the human rights situations
                            in Afghanistan and Iran. The resolutions drew on reports submitted by
                            the U.N. Human Rights Commission’s Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan,
                            Felix Ermacora of Austria, and its Special Representative on Iran,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAM_1">Andres Aguilar</persName> of Venezuela.
                            The resolutions expressed deep concern over the human rights situations
                            in both countries: The plenary vote on Afghanistan was 80 (US) –22–40,
                            and on Iran 53 (US) –30–45. In the voting on both resolutions we noticed
                            clear signs of deal-making between the Soviet bloc and Iran. Syria,
                            acting as a surrogate for Iran and the Soviets, proposed that no action
                            be taken on either resolution: The proposal was defeated in committee.
                            In plenary, the bloc countries either opposed, abstained, or did not
                            participate in the vote on Iran, with the Iranians not participating on
                            Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>7. The Committee also adopted resolutions, as it has for several years,
                            on Chile, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The resolutions on El Salvador and
                            Guatemala reflected many of the improvements in these two countries as
                            they head toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. While
                            the resolutions still remained unbalanced, the U.S. was able to abstain
                            on both; we would have joined consensus on El Salvador had the Soviet
                            Union not called for a vote. The Chile resolution was harsh and out of
                            proportion to the other resolutions and to the situation in Chile. The
                            U.S., while expressing concern about the human rights situation in
                            Chile, voted “no.”</p>
                        <p>8. Obviously stung by the Afghanistan report, the resulting resolution,
                            and the Committee’s willingness to deal with human rights situations in
                            places other than Latin America, the Soviets proposed (through <pb
                                facs="0294" n="248" xml:id="pg_248"/> the Ukrainian “delegation”) a
                            resolution on the “inadmissibility of the exploitation or distortion of
                            human rights issues for interfering in the internal affairs of states.”
                            This transparent effort to set back or even eliminate the U.N.’s ability
                            to work in the human rights field was put off when it encountered strong
                            opposition not only from Western but also from Third World delegations.
                            (Comment: We have not seen the end of Soviet efforts to cut the U.N.’s
                            Human Rights machinery.)</p>
                        <p>9. One of the two long-running Third Committee working groups concluded
                            several years of work by drafting a declaration on the rights of
                            individuals who are not nationals of the country in which they live. The
                            final product, adopted by the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>,
                            contributes nothing to the existing human rights instruments and merely
                            reiterates, in a qualified fashion, that certain basic rights should be
                            enjoyed by aliens as well as nationals of a state.</p>
                        <p>10. The U.S. cosponsored consensus resolutions on religious intolerance
                            and on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Voluntary Fund for Victims
                            of Torture. Consensus texts were also adopted on: The rights of the
                            child; the human rights covenants (and reporting obligations
                            thereunder); the status of the Convention Against Torture; summary
                            executions; disappearances; mass exoduses; and the United Kingdom’s
                            slow-moving initiative on psychiatric abuse. A Soviet resolution on “The
                            Right to Life” (i.e., let’s work to disarm <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>) was met by slightly stronger Western opposition than
                            in the past (nine negative votes) and the West broke consensus for the
                            first time in recent years on a <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>
                            resolution on measures to be taken against Nazism and Fascism, etc. A

                            genocide into <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> debates led to
                            consensus adoption of a bland resolution which could be troublesome in

                                80</ref>.</note> it is understood that the specific cases and
                            problems on which we hope to make concrete progress in the near term
                            will henceforth be handled through quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>At the same time we recognize that our fundamental ideological
                            differences, which encompass human rights, will continue to be the
                            subject of public debate. The Soviets will certainly not end their
                            propaganda campaign. On the contrary, under <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> we have already seen a step-up in the
                            propaganda effort, including emphasis on what the Soviets view as our
                            own shortcomings in the field of human rights.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, we shall distinguish between matters on which the Soviets
                            seem at least to <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> acting positively and
                            those matters on which they are clearly not prepared to engage us in
                            discussion. We should handle our concerns in the first category quietly
                            and our concerns in the second category publicly.</p>
                        <p>The first category will deal almost exclusively with emigration issues:
                            divided spouses, release of dual nationals, family reunion, and <pb
                                facs="0296" n="250" xml:id="pg_250"/> more broadly Jewish, Armenian,
                            and German emigration. It would also deal with the release of certain
                            persons from incarceration, usually followed by emigration. Adjustments
                            in Soviet policy in these areas, it should be noted, would not involve
                            fundamental change in the character of the Soviet state. (It should be
                            understood that though the Department would not go out of its way to
                            emphasize these issues, we shall, as appropriate, occasionally, and
                            generally at levels below the President and you, make it clear that the
                            aforementioned problems do exist and that we hope for early
                            resolution.)</p>
                        <p>The second category of issues would indeed involve basic change in Soviet
                            domestic policy. It would cover freedom of speech, the press and
                            assembly, the free exercise of religion, cultural freedom, the absence
                            of governmentally-directed repression, an end to psychiatric abuse,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>As to this second category of issues it is my understanding that the
                            following guidelines will be adopted:</p>
                        <p>(1) The President and you will choose the occasions carefully as to when
                            he or you would speak out.</p>
                        <p>(2) The rest of us will not hesitate to deal with these ideological
                            questions fully. We shall, however, concentrate on the presentation of
                            facts, facts that speak for themselves, rather than engage in rhetorical
                            flourishes. Our public diplomacy efforts in the field of human rights
                            should, therefore, continue, and should, if anything, be more
                            fine-tuned.</p>
                        <p>It is this last point which needs special emphasis. I believe that our
                            approach to public diplomacy in the field of human rights has tended to
                            be episodic. We have generally picked up on issues to which the media
                            have paid attention and may occasionally have contributed an item or two
                            to the general discussion. What I believe we have not had is a coherent,
                            cohesive, systematic and persistent approach to Soviet human rights
                            violations as part of our public diplomacy effort.</p>
                        <p>I would propose that we take a leaf out of the Soviet book in this
                            connection. I have been impressed in every encounter with them, how well
                            prepared they are with regard to their propaganda themes and
                            documentation (phony as it may be), how extraordinarily well they
                            synchronize their efforts in different fora, and their ability to stick
                            to a theme long enough to get it to sink in. They have, I believe, been
                            more successful than they should have been in their propaganda
                            campaigns, particularly those that have been directed against us and our
                            friends. They have not been able to do equally well in affirmative
                            propaganda for themselves simply because the product they are seeking to
                            sell is so obviously shoddy.</p>

                        <p>Here is the operational program which I would propose:</p>

                        <p>(1) In the first instance this Bureau, working with other relevant
                            bureaus of the Department and other appropriate agencies, will identify
                            the important human rights themes for use in our public diplomacy
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>(2) As the themes are identified this Bureau will assemble the relevant
                            data and prepare easily readable monographs thereon. The monographs
                            should be available for circulation within the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>(3) The participants in the group which identified the public diplomacy
                            topics (see (1) above) should then meet to discuss dissemination and (a)
                            identify appropriate target audiences, (b) the manner of dissemination
                            to these audiences, and (c) responsibility for the preparation of the
                            required pinpointed material. Each plan of dissemination will encompass
                            dissemination directly to the target audiences as well as dissemination
                            through multilateral fora (<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, OAS,
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, etc.) and interested private
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>I recommend we proceed immediately to effect the necessary inter-agency
                            coordination. The <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> Bureau could then
                            begin the effort with the use of existing resources. We might need a

                            its subordinate Sub-Commission. The session was also contentious, with
                            divisions apparent between African and Latin American members. At a

                            of the US Delegation in introducing and lobbying for its own
                            resolutions. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. After six arduous weeks, the 42nd session of the <gloss

                            midnight on March 14. The meeting was a success for the United States.
                            Judged against its pre-session objectives, the US Delegation, led by
                                <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR_1">Richard Schifter</persName>, accomplished the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>—Adoption of a resolution establishing a new Special Rapporteur on
                            Religious Intolerance;</p>
                        <p>—Adoption of a US-drafted resolution on the human rights situation in
                            Chile;</p>
                        <p>—A show of solid support among Western donor countries on a procedural
                            vote relevant to our resolution critical of the Ethiopian resettlement
                            program;</p>
                        <p>—Adoption of resolutions on Afghanistan and Iran which extended the
                            mandates of the special rapporteurs for both countries;</p>
                        <p>—Adoption of a Costa Rican draft resolution on El Salvador; and,</p>
                        <p>—Adoption of a resolution on Guatemala which terminates the mandate of
                            the special rapporteur and moves that country under the commission’s
                            program for advisory services.</p>
                        <p>4. On the down side, the US failed by narrow margins on separate votes on
                            two “name calling” paragraphs in resolutions dealing with the Middle
                            East. We were also unable to obtain a resolution condemning apartheid
                            which we could support. As in the past, African moderates <pb
                                facs="0299" n="253" xml:id="pg_253"/> (Senegal and Kenya) were
                            unwilling to oppose the radicals (the National Liberation Movements and
                            Tanzania) in order to remove objectionable paragraphs from the text. The
                            US was joined by two other Western countries in abstaining on the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>: While the US could look
                            back with a sense of achievement, the Soviets must have left Geneva
                            feeling that something had gone awry. In a series of abortive efforts
                            the Soviets and their allies:</p>
                        <p>—Failed on a procedural motion to block consideration of the US
                            resolution on religious intolerance by a vote of 7–22 (US) –14;</p>
                        <p>—Substantially modified their resolution on “Totalitarianism, Nazism and
                            Facism” and accepted biannual consideration in the future in the face of
                            a <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> proposal to take the item off the
                            agenda;</p>
                        <p>—Withdrew a draft resolution calling for the dissemination of only
                            “truthful and balanced information on human rights”;</p>
                        <p>—Backed off on allegations against the Special Rapporteur on Torture and
                            demands that the job be rotated annually on a geographical basis in
                            allowing the resolution extending the rapporteur’s mandate to be adopted
                            by consensus;</p>
                        <p>—Lost by a vote of 32 (US) –4–5 on an annual <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> procedural motion to provide on a contingency basis for
                            extra meetings for next year’s Commission. (The Soviets had argued for
                            more than an hour that the West was acting in disregard for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s current financial problems); and,</p>
                        <p>—Failed by a vote of 10–28 (US) –5 to defer consideration of all cases
                            under the Commission’s Confidential 1503 Procedures until next year.</p>
                        <p>6. In a major intervention under the Commission’s agenda item on human
                            rights violations worldwide, the Soviets alleged that the greatest
                            threat to human rights was the US policy of training armed bands and
                            sending them against emerging nations such as Angola, Afghanistan and
                            Nicaragua. This theme was picked up in speeches by bloc members and
                            reflected in a resolution on the use of mercenaries to impede the
                            exercise of the right of self-determination in Southern Africa which was
                            introduced by 18 African and Eastern co-sponsors and adopted by a vote
                            of 31–5 (US) –7. The Soviets turned aside a Western procedural challenge
                            and then easily adopted their biannual resolution on “the right to
                            life”. They also succeeded in adopting a much watered down resolution on
                            the right to adequate housing introduced by Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>7. Procedures: Beginning with Assistant Secretary General Herndl’s
                            opening statement on the budget crisis, this Commission seemed
                            preoccupied with the mechanics of its own operations and those of its
                            subsidiary body the Sub-Commission (<gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>)
                            on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. Debate
                            on the Sub-Commission was advanced in the order of business and 45
                            speakers were heard on <pb facs="0300" n="254" xml:id="pg_254"/> the
                            item. Comments were almost uniformly critical and there were numerous
                            suggestions for reform. Finally, after the issue was also considered by
                            an ad hoc working group, the Commission adopted resolutions which (A)
                            placed restrictions on reports prepared by Sub-Commission rapporteurs
                            and ended the practice of their personally reporting to the Commission;
                            (B) extended the term of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> members to 4
                            years; (C) provided for review by the Commission and <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss> of all <gloss target="#t_SC_1"
                                >SC</gloss> actions having financial implications; and, (D)
                            encouraged greater independence from government influence on the part of
                                <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>8. In a debate which ranged over the entire session, the Commission also
                            chewed over the institution of “special rapporteurs” and other types of
                            Commission representatives. Members seemed to agree that including the
                            Sub-Commission, there were too many rapporteurs, too many studies in
                            progress, and no real plan for ensuring that the end product was
                            worthwhile or even relevant. Beyond that [illegible] countries argued
                            that there was a hierarchy among “special rapporteurs”, “special
                            representatives” and “independent experts” and that the choice of one or
                            another of these “mechanisms” indicated the seriousness with which the
                            Commission viewed the human rights situation in a given country.
                            Non-aligned members supported by the East claimed that rapporteurs were
                            drawn mainly from Western countries and that this practice could not
                            continue. Greater concern was also shown over the role of <gloss
                                target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss>’s with highly critical views expressed
                            by Brazil and Colombia. The issue did not surface in the <gloss
                                target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss>, but suggestions were reportedly
                            advanced in other groups on ways to curtail interventions by <gloss
                                target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss>’s, especially their attacks on
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>9. In particular, concerns over procedure were evident in the
                            commission’s consideration of countries under the confidential
                            procedures established under <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                            Resolution 1503. Starting with the abortive <gloss target="#t_GDR_1"
                                >GDR</gloss> effort to defer the proceedings and the annual Soviet
                            attack on their legitimacy, the Commission largely ignored the substance
                            of the complaints and instead concentrated on debating which of the
                            procedures available to it would send what signal to what country.
                            Voting on countries was heavily influenced by a common perception that
                            implementation of the procedures is unfair and that only small and
                            friendless countries are caught while major offenders are not
                            questioned. It also reflected changes in governments which occurred
                            during the session. The Commission generally disregarding the
                            recommendations of its working group terminated consideration of Gabon
                            and the Philippines, and selected “milder intervention mechanisms” for
                            Zaire and Haiti. The debate over Zaire and Haiti surfaced a regional
                            division between the African and Latin American groups which developed
                            into a bitter relationship between Commission Chairman Charry (Colombia)
                            and African group leader Ambassador Sene (Senegal) that may affect the
                            future role of both groups in the Commission.</p>

                        <p>10. General issues: While the Commission’s actions on the Philippines and
                            Haiti were influenced by recent events in those countries,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d84fn5">Reference is to the exiling of Ferdinand Marcos,

                            Southern Africa failed to reflect events in those areas. The debate on
                            South Africa was pro forma and the resolutions adopted nearly identical
                            to those of previous years. On Israel the debate and resolutions were
                            also close reproductions of last year.<note n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d77fn2">footnote 2, Document 77</ref>.</note> The
                            Israeli Delegation felt it scored minor victories: (A) When seven
                            Western countries voted against the application of the Third Geneva
                            Convention, to “Palestinian fighters captured by Israel” (Resolution L.
                            12B, OP. 6); and (B) by raising the issues of Soviet Jewry and human
                            rights abuses in Arab countries. Israeli accusations that <gloss

                            President Hermann Klenner was a former member of Hitler’s <gloss

                            European press.</p>
                        <p>11. On other issues of importance the Commission extended the mandate of
                            its Special Rapporteur on Arbitrary and Summary Executions and, on a
                            trial basis, the mandate of the Working Group on Disappearances for two
                            years. The right to development was dealt with in a largely procedural
                            resolution which left the task of drafting a declaration to the General
                            Assembly, but provided for the convening of the working group for three
                            weeks in January 1986 to “study measure necessary to promote the right”.
                            Annual resolutions on self-determination in Western Sahara, Cambodia,
                            and Afghanistan were adopted by large majorities in a form unchanged
                            from previous years. An Argentine/India resolution on disarmament was
                            adopted by a vote of 34–0–8 (US) after all references to placing
                            disarmament on the Commission’s agenda were removed from the text.
                            Finally, the Commission adopted a resolution condemning hostage taking
                            which was introduced by France in a move motivated by the French
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>12. In a “postmortem” on the Commission attended by MissOffs from
                            Australia, India, Argentina, and the Philippines March 19, participants
                            agreed that one of the most positive aspects of the Commission was the
                            unprecedented activity of the US Delegation in introducing its own
                            resolutions and lobbying on their behalf. All felt that adoption of the
                            US-drafted resolutions on Chile and religious intolerance were the major
                            achievements of the Commission. Although MissOffs may have disagreed
                            with US on specific issues, all appeared reassured by this US expression
                            of interest in the Commission.</p>

                                corresp="#p_STW_1">Tom Simons</persName> and I met on August 1 with
                            Ambassador Kashlev, the head of the new Administration of Humanitarian
                            and Cultural Affairs in the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>.
                            It appears that the Soviet intention in creating this office was to
                            imitate our own Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, but it
                            is clear that Kashlev has no interest in discussing specific cases of
                            Soviet human rights violations.</p>
                        <p>Kashlev’s new office will apparently focus on areas such as social
                            welfare, culture and information which the Soviets have traditionally
                            tried to use as counterpoints to U.S. charges of specific human rights
                            violations. This, of course, means that the new office will concern
                            itself with what the Soviets consider major human rights problems <hi
                                rend="italic">outside</hi> the borders of the Soviet Union. Kashlev
                            mentioned apartheid, hunger, and a freeze on nuclear testing. The new
                            office may also have an important role in the current Soviet media
                            campaign to sell the Soviet Union as a progressive state on humanitarian
                            issues. But Kashlev emphasized that U.S. concerns about specific cases
                            and other human rights issues would continue to be the responsibilities
                            of the Consular Office of the Foreign Ministry and the Soviet Ministry
                            of the Interior. He also mentioned that the Soviets are busy reconciling
                            their legal regulations with their international commitments and ridding
                            their practices of “bureaucratism and voluntarism” in the humanitarian
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Tom and I said we welcomed the creation of the office as an opportunity
                            to engage in dialogue on the issues and we made a major effort to
                            present Kashlev with a list of our principal human rights concerns,
                            including emigration, <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName>,
                            and cases of imprisoned or exiled Helsinki monitors.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d85fn2">Not found.</note> Tom made the particular point of
                            emphasizing that human rights is an international rather than just a
                            bilateral concern and is an integral element in our overall agenda for
                            relations with the Soviet Union. He also made the point that poor Soviet
                                perform<pb facs="0303" n="257" xml:id="pg_257"/>ance on Jewish
                            issues puts “quiet diplomacy” under strain and promises real problems
                            for an eventual summit, since it provides speculation that a Soviet
                            policy decision had been made to get rid of the Jewish emigration issue
                            once and for all.</p>
                        <p>Kashlev was either unprepared or unauthorized to deal with the political
                            aspects of the situation. His only relevant comment was that there has
                            been no change in the way Jews will be treated, i.e. not differently
                            from other Soviet citizens for emigration purposes.</p>
                        <p>Though the meeting was conducted in a reasonably friendly atmosphere, the
                            benefits, if any, were small. It may help if Kashlev were to report
                            accurately to his superiors what we said. On the other hand, he had very
                            little to say. As long as his office is not prepared to discuss cases,
                            the value of dialogue with him will be limited.</p>

                            to humanitarian and regional questions, which, he pointed out, had been
                            discussed by the second (non-arms control) working group. The President
                            agreed, and the two briefly reviewed papers prepared by the working
                            group the night before.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">Not further

                            in terms of such issues as family reunification and religious
                            persecution. But he did want to urge <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> to move forward in this area, since it was a
                            major factor domestically in limiting how far the President could go in
                            cooperation with the Soviet Union. As he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> before, one in every eight
                            people in the United States had family connections of some sort to the
                            Soviet Union, so a significant part of the American population was
                            concerned by such phenomena as the shut-down in emigration from the
                            Soviet Union. We would continue to provide lists of people we had reason
                            to believe wanted to depart. And if the Soviets loosened up, we would
                            not exploit it. We would simply express our appreciation.</p>

                            expressed regret that there was not more time to address humanitarian
                            questions. There were some specific concerns he had wanted to put before
                            the President. And he wanted to make clear that Soviet public opinion
                            was also concerned about the state of human rights in the United
                            States.</p>

                            serve his own purposes. Under <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>, the traditional Russian inferiority complex
                            has been given modern expression through the pronounced sensitivity to
                            bad publicity and a concerted effort to appear the global “good

                            selectively improving their human rights performance, we must guard
                            against charges that our firm policies are the result of domestic
                            political pressures rather than adherence to principle. While pressing
                            for increased Jewish emigration, we should address the entire range of
                            human rights issues. We also should rebuff Soviet efforts to redefine
                            human rights in economic and social terms by continuing to point out

                            rights. Stymied by an entrenched bureaucracy and the ingrained habits of
                            the Soviet people, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> has
                            enlisted artists and intellectuals in his campaign to “restructure”
                            Soviet society. Few topics are now off limits and faults can—indeed
                            must—be addressed. In that regard, cultural life has been liberalized.
                            Yet, the stated function of the arts and sciences under Communism has
                            not changed. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> has
                            re-emphasized that art and scientific inquiry must serve the state and

                            Recognizing that refusal to clear up divided family cases, to allow sick
                            and old people to seek medical care in the West were often pointless,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> probably decided
                            that resolving those cases offered public relations benefits in the West
                            without compromising hardline attitudes on dissidence and

                            and may, as <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Shcharanskiy</persName> and
                            others have argued, actually hinder emigration by erecting more

                            redefine human rights in ways that emphasize social and economic
                            conditions (as well as “the right to peace”) rather than individual
                            liberties. We need to stress that Soviet performance is seriously
                            deficient under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> definition of human rights.
                            We should continue the approach laid out by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR_1">Schifter</persName> at Ottawa when he pointed out
                            Soviet economic and social failings.</p>
                        <p>While some of our allies may accuse us of being confrontational, we can
                            point out to them that we (and to some extent the British) bear the
                            brunt of Soviet attacks on our domestic failings (real or alleged). If
                            we show a readiness to retaliate in kind, in part by pointing out
                            growing Soviet problems such as infant mortality and hidden
                            unemployment, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> may be

                            make additional human rights improvements such as increased
                            emigration.</p>
                        <p>While continuing to press the Soviets on emigration, we should be careful
                            to lay equal stress on other human rights issues, including abuses of
                            psychiatry, the repression of Russian Orthodox priests, Catholics,
                            Baptists, and Pentecostalist believers, Ukrainian and Tatar
                            nationalists, and members of the Soviet “peace movement.” As the Soviets
                            take the offensive on human rights, we could become vulnerable to
                            charges that we are unwilling to respond positively to Soviet gestures
                            largely because of domestic politcal pressure from Jewish, Baltic
                            nationalist and other groups.</p>
                        <p>Pressure from these groups is a reality of American politics, and we
                            should not conceal this fact. But we should also demonstrate, by
                            stressing the whole range of human rights issues, that the fundamental
                            basis of our concern for human rights is not domestic political
                            pressure, but our own values as reflected in our human rights

                            insistence that the Soviets adhere to agreements such as the Helsinki

                            humanitarian in nature, and requiring no significant change in the

                        <p>As to goals, we distinguish between those which are:</p>
                        <p>(a) immediate:</p>
                        <p>(i) The release from imprisonment, internal exile or mental hospitals of
                            persons imprisoned, exiled or committed for no reason other than the
                            exercise of a human right (freedom of expression or religion), even
                            though such exercise may have violated the laws of the Soviet Union;
                            this should include persons convicted on trumped-up charges; (ii) a
                            resolution of all our divided spouses and dual nationality cases; (iii)
                            an end to jamming; (iv) a modest step-up in emigration, to perhaps
                            10,000 to 12,000 annually (which would not require an immediate change
                            in the 1986 Emigration Law);<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Reference is to

                        <p>(b) intermediate:</p>
                        <p>(i) a general loosening of controls on freedom of expression so as to
                            allow a return to at least those standards which were applied in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the period 1958–65 or
                            prior to Stalin’s rise to preeminence (basically, no punishment for mere
                            speaking and writing, if not accompanied by organizational activity);
                            (ii) substantial loosening of controls on the exercise of religious
                            belief (allowing congregations to engage in religious activities such as
                            bible study and charitable work), permitting the importation of bibles,
                            prayerbooks, and other objects of religious significance; (iii) an end
                            to the abuse of psychiatry; (iv) relaxation of controls on the
                            importation of books, periodicals, newspapers, and films; (v)
                            people-to-people exchanges of a magnitude that makes <gloss

                            (perhaps in excess of 15,000 persons annually); (vi) allowing greater
                            cultural freedom, including the teaching and use of non-Russian
                            languages; (vii) modification of the 1986 Emigration Law to allow annual
                            emigration in excess of 25,000 (possibly by expanding the circle of
                            relatives who may extend an invitation for emigration); (viii) respect
                            for the right of privacy and a reduction of the status and powers of the
                            secret police to, at least, the role it played in the early
                                Sixties;<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">See <ref target="#d88fn5"

                        <p>(c) long range:</p>
                        <p>full compliance with the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives</p>
                        <p>In pursuing our human-rights goals, we are motivated by the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <pb facs="0310" n="264" xml:id="pg_264"/>
                        <p>(a) Our Government’s commitment to human rights reflects the truly
                            idealistic sentiment of the American people that we are our brothers’
                            keepers. We engage in human rights activities first and foremost to help
                            individual human beings.</p>
                        <p>(b) A more open and democratic Soviet Union is less likely to pursue
                            expansionist goals. Our advocacy of respect for human rights in the
                            Soviet Union is, therefore, in harmony with our interest in the genuine
                            relaxation of tension between us and in mutual arms reduction.</p>
                        <p>(c) As long as our relations with the Soviet Union continue to be
                            adversarial, our public emphasis on human rights helps advance our cause
                            in the court of world public opinion and strengthen domestic support for
                            our foreign policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>(d) Also, for that period our statements serve to give psychological
                            support to Soviet citizens who are subjected to persecution for their
                            political or religious beliefs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possibilities of Attaining Goals</p>
                        <p>The “immediate goals” identified above are basically humanitarian and can
                            be achieved by the Soviet leadership without any significant tinkering
                            with its totalitarian system. It is for that reason that they may very
                            well be within reach.</p>
                        <p>The “intermediate goals” would involve willingness to make some truly
                            meaningful changes in present practices without necessarily changing the
                            basic structure of the state. They will undoubtedly be difficult to
                            attain.</p>
                        <p>The “long-range goal” would indeed require basic change in the state’s
                            structure. Although this goal may appear quixotic, it provides us with a
                            framework within which we can pursue our immediate and intermediate
                            goals and aligns our Soviet human rights policy in a logically
                            consistent manner with our overall approach to human rights as an
                            element of our foreign policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Targets</p>
                        <p>To reach the third and fourth of the above-listed four objectives we
                            would, of course, need to concentrate on the general public, both at
                            home and abroad. To realize the first two objectives, however, namely to
                            effect significant change in Soviet human rights performance, we need to
                            zero in on the highest level of leadership, the Politburo. This is so
                            because of the highly centralized character of the decisionmaking
                            process in the Soviet Union’s totalitarian system. Given the present
                            system of tight police control, it is highly unlikely that change can be
                            brought about through pressure from the general public. Nor, given the
                            subservience and careerism built into the bureaucratic system, can it be
                            expected that significant changes in policy will be effected on <pb
                                facs="0311" n="265" xml:id="pg_265"/> the basis of recommendations
                            from the Soviet Union’s lower-ranking officialdom. For our goals to be
                            attained, we must persuade the Politburo, most importantly the General
                            Secretary, that taking such a course is in the Soviet Union’s best
                            interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Methods of Persuasion</p>
                        <p>Steeped as they are in Leninist thought, the Soviet leaders will not be
                            willing to effect changes in their system which would improve human
                            rights conditions unless such changes can be justified in a
                            Marxist-Leninist context. This means that neither Judaeo-Christian
                            concepts of moral behavior toward one’s fellow-human being nor the
                            Enlightenment’s notions of the inalienable rights of the individual will
                            cut any ice with them.<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">The decision of
                                Khrushchev and his colleagues in 1953 to sideline the secret police
                                is a unique exception. After having lived for years in utter fear of

                                they were afraid could have been done to them. The present
                                generation of leaders did not experience the same fear and is,
                                therefore, more inclined to give greater rein to the secret police.
                                [Footnote is in the original.]</note> One cannot appeal to their
                            “better nature.”</p>
                        <p>What one can do with the present Soviet leaders is persuade them that
                            better human rights performance will result in some benefits in which
                            they are interested. This requires that we try to determine what
                            benefits are of interest to them and that we also decide which of these
                            benefits we are willing and able to deliver.</p>
                        <p>Though Leninist in their political behavior and their ideas about the
                            dominance of the party and the state over the individual, the present
                            Soviet leaders do not share the idealistic objectives of the founders of
                            their faith. Maintaining the rights and privileges of the Nomenklatura,
                            the Communist leadership group, is a most essential piece of their
                            governmental program. That is why our immediate and intermediate goals
                            must be limited to fit this aspect of present-day Soviet reality. That
                            is why, also, we must search for the benefits that we can offer and
                            which would be of interest to the other side by analyzing the frame of
                            mind of the present Soviet leaders.</p>

                            >Gorbachev</persName>’s Outlook</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> is a product of the
                            Soviet Union’s post-Stalin bureaucratic system: a party operative who
                            combined outstanding intelligence and managerial ability with a
                            willingness to work on behalf of the party and to his superiors, which
                            enabled him to climb the promotional ladder to the very top. He is not a
                            closet liberal or anything close to it. On the contrary, our best
                            information suggests that he is a hard-liner, but shrewd and rational.
                            Our notions of human rights simply do not fit into his value system. But
                            he has clearly recognized the Soviet <pb facs="0312" n="266"
                                xml:id="pg_266"/> Union’s serious economic shortcomings and is eager
                            to do something about them. In fact, he appears to have staked his
                            leadership role on this issue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> appears to believe that
                            the Soviet Union’s economic performance can be turned around through
                            improved management and motivation of the work force, from top to
                            bottom, but without fundamental changes in the system. He is interested
                            in ending the Soviet malaise. His notions about how to accomplish these
                            results are reasonably enlightened and involve somewhat greater freedom
                            of expression—as long as the system is not being questioned—and an
                            emphasis on the rule of law, including repressive laws, rather than the
                            exercise of broad administrative discretion. Also, punishment for the
                            exercise of human rights is to be meted out more sparingly, only if it
                            clearly serves a state purpose, rather than as an expression of state
                            displeasure.</p>
                        <p>These efforts at self-improvement appear to go hand-in-hand with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s thoughts about
                            Western help. As distinct from Brezhnev, who expected billions of
                            American dollars for Siberian development, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> appears to have a far more sophisticated
                            understanding of his country’s needs and is more realistic about what
                            the West is willing to provide. He may very well be interested in
                            Western credits, but he is interested in Western economic development
                            know-how as well. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s
                            interest in practical ways and means to pull the Soviet economy out of
                            its present rut may very well identify for us the benefits we can offer
                            for which the Soviet Union might make human-rights concessions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Leverage</p>
                        <p>We should not overestimate the leverage with which we are thus provided.
                            Neither should we underestimate it. Arrangements between us and the
                            Soviets can provide immediate practical benefits to them. They can also
                            send a signal to the private sector and to the international community
                            that it is all-right to do business with the Soviet Union, thus
                            providing indirect benefits as well. The challenge to us is to develop a
                            long-term method of operations under which we relate Soviet human rights
                            performance to the benefits we are prepared to offer them. I hope we
                            shall be able to furnish you with an agreed-upon memorandum along these
                                lines.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>In addition, it is essential that we keep our goals well in mind,
                            particularly those which have here been labeled “intermediate,” and keep
                            the pressure up. It is critically important that we do not suggest <pb
                                facs="0313" n="267" xml:id="pg_267"/> to the Soviets that just
                            because their behavior in the past has been extraordinarily brutal, a
                            lesser order of repression is now acceptable. On this point we ought to
                            go with A.M. Rosenthal, who in his column in <hi rend="italic">The New

                                smoother chap than most of his predecessors but he has not touched
                                the police nature of the Soviet state and has not even hinted he
                                will. How could he? He is part of it and rules through it. But
                                everytime he says he will let a suppressed book be published or a

                                of prisoners the West goes into a mad fandango of appreciation.
                                There are, blessedly, Shcharanskys and some journalists who cry
                                “wait, wait” to the world but they are outnumbered by eager folk who

                        <p>In our previous memorandum of December 24, we detailed the preliminary
                            objections to the Torture Convention that have been raised by Justice
                            Department officials.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Not found.</note> We
                            appreciate your offer in response to call Attorney General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> or Deputy Attorney General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAI_1">Burns</persName> to solicit their
                            support for U.S. signature and ratification of the Convention. While
                            such a call would undoubtedly be helpful, we believe an even more
                            effective means of gaining Justice Department support for the Convention
                            would be for you to convene a meeting of high-level officials from
                            Justice and State.</p>
                        <p>We believe the Torture Convention merits such high-level attention. The
                            practice of torture is abhorrent, and the United States should do
                            everything in its power to bring it to an end. While recognizing that it
                            may be difficult for the United States to prosecute those accused of
                            torture abroad, we nonetheless believe that the threat of prosecution
                            will deter some torturers and will prevent the United States from
                            becoming a haven for torturers. Moreover, we are constantly under fire
                            from the Soviet bloc for our failure to ratify human rights conventions.
                            The Convention offers a concrete opportunity to demonstrate that the
                            United States is prepared to sign on to such instruments when they are
                            of sufficient value.</p>
                        <p>The Justice Department objections expressed so far reflect a fundamental
                            disagreement with us over the value of U.S. ratification of the
                            Convention and an underlying pessimism about the Administration’s
                            ability to get the necessary declarations, understandings and
                            reservations from the new Democratic Senate. These are essentially
                            political, and not technical legal, judgments. We need to find out now
                            whether the highest political levels at Justice agree or can be
                            persuaded to agree that the U.S. should move forward with the Convention
                            and are willing to direct their subordinates to review the Department of
                            State package expeditiously and in that spirit. If we cannot obtain
                            political support at Justice, we will be resigning ourselves to letting
                            the Convention languish in the Justice Department bureaucracy for the
                            rest of this Administration. A high-level meeting would allow us to
                            demonstrate to Justice the priority that we place on signature and
                            ratification of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>If you are able and willing to host a meeting, we would propose that the
                            participants from the Justice Department include: Deputy Attorney <pb

                            U.S. Initiative on Cuban Human Rights Abuses (<gloss target="#t_SS_1"
                                >S/S</gloss> No. 5704623).</p>
                        <p>1. (C) Issue for Decision:</p>
                        <p>Our principal goal at the February 2–March 13 Human Rights Commission
                            meeting is adoption of a U.S. resolution to place Cuban human rights
                            abuses under the Commission’s scrutiny. We need your personal
                            intervention, in the form of a letter to your colleagues in key
                            Commission member states, to overcome the deep reluctance of many
                            members to confront this issue.</p>
                        <p>2. (C) Essential Factors:</p>
                        <p>The implications of the U.S. initiative extend well beyond the Human
                            Rights Commission. The initiative is a test case of our ability to begin
                            to translate the institutional improvements obtained at the 41st <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> into the political sphere throughout
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> system. In addition, it is a rare
                            opportunity to undermine one of Cuba’s most important international
                            assets, the protective cover of its regional and non-aligned groups. It
                            is also a means of escalating pressure on Cuba to ameliorate abuses in
                            individual human rights cases. As such, this initiative amply merits
                            your personal intervention.</p>
                        <p>Our initial contacts with member state governments indicate deep
                            reluctance to confront Cuba, despite private agreement that the human
                            rights situation on the island is one of the worst in the world. Latin
                            American and non-aligned member states are particularly vulnerable to
                            Cuban and Soviet pressures. The key to success is the attitude of our
                            Western allies. Among these, the Australians and Belgians have been
                            forthcoming, the British very negative, with the rest in between. The
                            British attitude, which may be related to their wish not to jeopardize
                            their chances of re-election to the Human Rights Commission at the
                            Spring 1987 <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss> Session, is the
                            most disturbing and potentially damaging.</p>
                        <p>Despite the expected initial reluctance, we believe there is a good
                            chance to obtain Western support and to achieve our objective at this
                                <pb facs="0317" n="271" xml:id="pg_271"/> session of the Commission,
                            with sustained high-level U.S. input. A letter from you to your
                            counterparts in key Commission member governments will be an important
                            link in our overall effort.</p>

                        <p>1. This is <gloss target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss>–391.</p>
                        <p>2. As widely expected, on March 11 India introduced a motion to “take no
                            action” on the U.S. resolution on human rights in Cuba.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d91fn2">In telegram 6148 from New Delhi, March 11, the
                                Embassy reported that Indian disagreement over the resolution on
                                Cuba was due, in part, to U.S. opposition to an Argentine resolution
                                on human rights violations in Sri Lanka. (Department of State,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D870477–0364)</note> After <pb
                                facs="0318" n="272" xml:id="pg_272"/> lengthy debate, and the defeat
                            of a Bulgarian motion to close debate, the Indian motion was approved by
                            a vote of 19–18 (U.S.) –6. Therefore, the U.S. resolution never came to
                            be voted upon.</p>
                        <p>3. The loss by one vote (a tie would have meant victory for us) was
                            heartbreaking. Particularly disappointing was the behavior of the major
                            Latin democracies, in particular Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia.
                            With the exception of Brazil (abstained), all of South America voted in
                            favor of the Indian motion. The only bright spot was Costa Rica. The
                            Costa Rican Ambassador Soley Soler was simply magnificent. He took the
                            floor on numerous occasions to speak against the Bulgarian and Indian
                            motions and voted with us throughout. We hope that AmEmbassy San Jose
                            will express our deep appreciation for Costa Rica’s brave, energetic,
                            and principled stand.</p>

                            namely his desire to reinvigorate the Soviet Union and improve the
                            operations of the economy, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> has initiated major programs to open up to
                            public scrutiny and debate governmental operations at the local level.
                            For the same reason he has loosened somewhat the rigid controls recently
                            in effect with regard to cultural activities. Change with regard to
                            other aspects of freedom of expression has been far more limited and
                            driven more by efforts to improve the Soviet Union’s public-relations
                            image. There is no indication as yet of any change in the Soviet Union’s
                            basic structure as a totalitarian dictatorship, in which the fundamental
                            human rights spelled out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                            (and therefore covered by the Helsinki Final Act) are denied and in
                            which the secret police apparatus plays a central role. <hi

                        <p>At first blush, it seems that confusing and contradictory messages are
                            coming out of the Soviet Union these days concerning respect for human
                            rights. As we try to analyze recent developments, we often speak of
                            “mixed signals.” Some observers suggest that <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> is pressing for
                            liberalization, but that some hardliners, particularly in the <gloss
                                target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, are attempting to sabotage his
                            efforts through acts of a repressive nature.</p>
                        <p>We cannot speak with certainty as to what goes on in the Soviet
                            leadership behind the scenes. However, the leaders do speak out and
                            their statements are published. A careful reading of these statements,
                            when placed in the context provided by Soviet history and Leninist
                            ideology and terminology, helps provide us with an understanding of the
                            new developments in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>What the new leaders emphasize and demonstrate is their belief in
                            Marxism-Leninism and their intent, in the spirit of Lenin, to “get <pb
                                facs="0321" n="275" xml:id="pg_275"/> the Soviet Union moving again”
                            toward its socialist goals, through more and harder work, improved
                            management, and greater efficiency. This preoccupation with better
                            economic performance appears to influence all aspects of <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s program, including the
                            innovations that have human rights implications. What may appear as
                            “conflicting signals” turn out to be part of a logical scheme if we sort
                            out the various strands of the <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> program that relate to human rights.</p>
                        <p>For purposes of this analysis, the programs of “openness” and
                            “restructuring” are divided into three distinct categories:</p>

                            Other Governmental Reforms</p>
                        <p>This is the area in which <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> is making the most profound changes, taking
                            the greatest risks, and encountering his most substantial opposition.
                            His motivation is clear. He recognizes the weakness of the Soviet
                            economy and wants to strengthen it. As management of the Soviet economy
                            is an integral part of governmental operations, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s efforts at improving the
                            economy are an essential element of his program of governmental
                            reform.</p>
                        <p>One of the major problems identified by <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> has been the personal and professional
                            inadequacy of a great many persons in leadership positions. The major
                            culprits, in his opinion, were Leonid Brezhnev and other people
                            associated with Brezhnev in the 18 years in which he led the Soviet
                            Union. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> and his
                            associates have now replaced Brezhnev and his crew in the principal
                            positions of leadership. But <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> has concluded that that is not sufficient,
                            that the orders from the top are not effectively carried out at lower
                            levels, that it is necessary to reach into the lower rungs of the
                            bureaucracy and shake things up, replace those who take bribes, are
                            drunk on the job, or fail to perform effectively and efficiently.</p>
                        <p>As the leadership could not possibly identify all the weak links
                            throughout the entire Soviet system, another way had to be found. It was
                            “glasnost.” The bureaucracy, it was made clear to all, was no longer
                            sacrosanct. Persons criticizing public officials would no longer be
                            incarcerated or committed to mental institutions. On the contrary, their
                            comments would be welcomed and action would be taken thereon. In order
                            to effect improvements in the operations of the state and its
                            enterprises, citizens would not be limited in their critiques to the
                            naming of individual wrong-doers. They could also feel free to offer
                            their thoughts on what they might perceive as inefficiencies on the
                            local level, at which they could observe conditions directly. In that
                            way the whole country could become involved in the effort to upgrade
                            economic and other governmental operations.</p>
                        <pb facs="0322" n="276" xml:id="pg_276"/>
                        <p>Closely related to the opening up of the bureaucracy to public scrutiny
                            and criticism is <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s
                            emphasis on the rule of law. In a country in which so many aspects of
                            the citizen’s life are regulated by the government, the arbitrary use by
                            local officials of administrative discretion can be particularly
                            oppressive. As another element of “openness” <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> has insisted on the writing
                            and publishing of laws and regulations on a variety of subjects which in
                            the past have been controlled through vague confidential policy
                            guidelines. The purpose of the new approach is to let the officials know
                            precisely what the limits of their authority are and to let the public
                            know these limits so that they can insist that officials do indeed
                            follow the instructions they have received.</p>
                        <p>This change in the rules under which the Soviet state operates is indeed
                            most profound. For many a Soviet citizen this is what freedom of speech
                            is all about. All that citizen ever wanted to do in exercising freedom
                            of speech was to complain about the wrongdoing in front of his own eyes
                            and about officials who were treating him unfairly and unjustly. He can
                            do that now.</p>
                        <p>To the government officials the effect of this change in the rules has
                            been equally profound. The entire Soviet bureaucratic system is built on
                            lock-step advancement based on seniority. The road ahead was always safe
                            and secure. All one had to do is engage in apple-polishing, including
                            cooperation in the petty (or not so petty) graft in which one’s
                            superiors were involved. By playing along in this manner, one was fully
                            protected against all criticism. The bureaucracy was sacrosanct.</p>
                        <p>This system of rule by a sacrosanct bureaucracy, the prohibition of any
                            kind of criticism of its work, had been in effect since the rise of
                            Stalin to one-man leadership in the early Thirties. Khrushchev tried to
                            tackle some aspects of the problem toward the end of his period in
                            office. His efforts along these lines may very well have been a factor
                            in his downfall. What this means is that <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>’s openness and restructuring with regard to
                            the Soviet bureaucratic system is taking the Soviet Union back to the
                            Twenties, the time of Lenin, and that portion of the post-Lenin period
                            in which Stalin had not yet achieved sole and supreme power.</p>
                        <p>But one of the essential elements of Leninism is that no questioning of
                            the basic structure of the system is allowed. <hi rend="italic">That
                                facet of the system remains unchanged</hi>. Openness is limited to
                            the exercise of freedom of expression on local problems. It does not
                            extend to questions of basic governmental policy. The rules prohibiting
                            the discussion of such questions remain fully in force. The lines are
                            clearly drawn.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Nomenklatura, the term used to describe the privileged
                            state and party bureaucracy, is troubled and the Nomenkla<pb facs="0323"

                        <p>In their allegedly classless society, the Soviets recognize as a subgroup
                            of the working class the men and women who work with their brains. They
                            are referred to as the “intelligentsia.” In his analysis of conditions
                            in the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>
                            appears to have recognized that this group, in particular, had lost
                            hope, had been affected by a malaise which sapped its vitality. In
                            focusing his attention on the intelligentsia in an effort to change the
                            basic outlook of the group, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> may have been motivated by a number of
                            factors, namely (a) the recognition that in the information age this is
                            indeed the group whose performance will most significantly affect the
                            future development of the Soviet economy; (b) an understanding that it
                            is the intelligentsia from which dissidents and any dissident movement
                            might spring.</p>
                        <p>Cynics among the ancient Romans expressed their disdain for democracy by

                            appears to have concentrated on the equivalent of circuses, changes in
                            the drab field of Soviet culture. Thus we now see books published or to
                            be published, theatrical plays, and films allowed to be shown, all of
                            which were heretofore on the prohibited list.</p>
                        <p>What must be underlined in this context is that a close examination of
                            the books now being published raises questions as to why they were
                            prohibited in the first place. Nabokov<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2"

                            brutality of the Stalinist system but also its utter senselessness: the
                            victims of the terror were not enemies of the state, just ordinary
                            people who were being persecuted without good reason.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>’s
                            “new thinking” is that history is to be rewritten once more. Stalin’s
                            failure as a military strategist in 1941<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4"
                                >Reference is to the 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.</note>
                            <pb facs="0324" n="278" xml:id="pg_278"/> is again to be noted. And
                            there is even the possibility that old Bolsheviks like Zinoviev, Kamenev
                            and Bukharin, all executed in the Stalin purges, who have for decades
                            been non-persons, will be mentioned again. But there is no suggestion at
                            this time that any other aspects of Soviet or of world history are to be
                            reviewed. Lenin’s friends and colleagues will be rehabilitated
                            posthumously, but not the persons he considered his enemies.</p>
                        <p>Thus, to date there is no indication that the new cultural freedom is
                            reaching beyond the limits which Lenin would have permitted. No books
                            are published, nor plays or films shown, nor history books rewritten
                            which challenge basic Marxist-Leninist assumptions. We must assume the
                            leadership believes that it can keep things that way. Whether it will
                            succeed, or whether the intelligentsia, once its appetite has been
                            whetted, will push beyond the lines of the presently permissible,
                            whether the authorities will resist, and if so, how successful they will
                            be, only time will tell. What must be kept in mind is that the Soviet
                            government’s ability to maintain controls in this field is formidable:
                            it owns the printing presses, the theaters and the movie projectors. It
                            may very well have the power it needs to keep the intelligentsia in
                            check.</p>

                        <p>The “mixed signals” referred to at the beginning may be a reflection of
                            the major changes in the behavior of Soviet authorities in the areas of
                            local governmental reform and of culture, which contrast with the minor
                            changes in the Soviet behavior pattern in all other areas affecting
                            human rights. To be sure, there have been hints of further changes in
                            the offing and some observers have expressed great hope that there will
                            be a general relaxation of controls. This memorandum concentrates only
                            on what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> and does not seek to predict future
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>When we examine the field of human rights beyond the areas of local
                            governmental reform and of culture, we come up against the limitations
                            imposed on Soviet citizens because of their political outlook, their
                            religion, their desire to maintain their native culture, or in the case
                            of Jews and Crimean Tatars, their ethnic descent. In all these areas
                            there appears to have been no basic change. Public expressions of
                            dissent and failures to adhere to regulations governing the formation of
                            associations, including religious associations, remain punishable.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the changes set forth in (1) and (2) above seem to be driven by

                            recently to have brought about some relaxation in the treatment of
                            dissent. The most significant evidence of such relaxation has been the

                            from Special Regime Labor Camp 389/36–1 at Perm, known as the most

                        <p>The recent prisoner-release program, it should be noted, is neither a
                            large-scale “rehabilitation” effort nor a large-scale amnesty. The
                            Soviet authorities have announced that releases are based on
                            case-by-case reviews of the files. It would appear that with the
                            political dissident movement destroyed and the Jewish emigration
                            movement focusing on departure from the country, the release of persons
                            associated with either group is deemed tolerable. The religious and
                            nationality movements that are committed to staying in the U.S.S.R. are
                            deemed greater threats and persons affiliated with either of them seem
                            to have a more difficult time getting released.</p>
                        <p>What must be kept in mind, therefore, in analyzing the present state of
                            human rights in the Soviet Union, is that hundreds if not thousands of
                            political prisoners remain in jail, exile or mental institutions, that
                            we don’t know of any change in the treatment of these prisoners, that
                            the power and practices of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> have
                            not changed, that the same is true of the laws and regulations governing

                            Fidel Castro, who, like a medieval potentate, releases prisoners from
                            his dungeons in honor of visiting dignitaries. With the Soviets it is
                            necessary to lay down our markers on human rights issues and await their
                            action. In your discussions and by calling for the designation of an

                        <p>What I gathered from him is that recognized denominations will be allowed
                            to open more places of worship, import bibles and prayer books and
                            maintain contacts with co-religionists abroad. The present scheme of
                            governmental regulation of religion will, however, be maintained, the
                            sphere of authorized activity will remain limited to ritual functions,
                            and religious education outside the home will remain prohibited. The
                            Ukrainian Catholic Church, about which I made specific inquiries, will
                            remain outlawed (probably because of the Church’s Ukrainian nationalist
                            tendencies).</p>

                        <p>The cases of political prisoners will continue to be reviewed, as will be
                            the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to political crimes. Our
                            expression of concern with regard to Camp 36 at Perm was noted. The
                            matter will be looked into. I presented a list of political prisoners
                            and an appeal concerning them prepared by the American Association for
                            the Advancement of Science, calling attention to the high standing of
                            the Association in the United States and its non-political
                            character.</p>

                        <p>The various lists of prospective emigrants regarding which we expressed
                            concern will continue to be reviewed. The principal problem standing in
                            the way of positive resolution of cases on our rep lists as well as the
                            refusenik list are determinations that a person possesses
                            security-sensitive information, which results in the denial of
                            permission to depart. In response to my observation that some of these
                            determinations may have been wrong in the first instance and in other
                            cases <pb facs="0328" n="282" xml:id="pg_282"/> information at issue may
                            now no longer be security-sensitive, I was told that during recent weeks
                            a process has been set up under which requests to review such
                            determinations may be filed with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. I
                            was further told that the Presidium is required to decide simple cases
                            within thirty days and complex cases within six months. (We subsequently
                            urged persons who could benefit from this procedure to take advantage of
                            it.)</p>
                        <p>Concerning emigration of persons not on the refusenik list, my principal
                            interlocutor made a point of reading to me, word for word, section 20 of
                            the new emigration decree, concerning non-discrimination, so as to
                            underline the Soviet position that there will be no special treatment of
                            Jews. (This is in contrast with what Morris Abram understood <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> to say to him.)<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d94fn4">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>The list which you were finally given was clearly a status report on a
                            series of cases which we have presented to the Soviets in the past.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">Not found.</note> (Some of the cases which
                            were reported to us as satisfactorily resolved were cases of whose
                            resolution we have been told before.) Accordingly, I assume that the
                            fact that Feltsman<note n="6" xml:id="d94fn6">Soviet pianist Vladimir
                                Feltsman.</note> may merely “go abroad,” which implies short-term
                            visits, does not mean that the final word on his emigration application
                            has been spoken. Similarly the negative response on two of the cases may
                            also not mean that this is, in fact, the last word.</p>

                        <p>This broader engagement would be designed to correct the widespread
                            perception that when the U.S. says human rights, it means Israel and the
                            American Jewish lobby. It would ease Muslim feelings that their needs
                            are subordinate to those of Jews, and the corollary assumption that we
                            are also anti-Islamic. It would also increase our credibility in the
                            Arab world by doing something positive, thus reducing concerns that the
                            U.S. is less reliable because of the Iranian arms shipments. Finally,
                            this advocacy of the rights of Soviet Muslims would slow the pace of
                            growing Soviet engagement in the Middle East and parts of Asia,
                            including Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia. We can accomplish this by
                            reinforcing traditional Muslim suspicions of the Soviet Union, pointing
                            out the contradiction between the Kremlin’s external <pb facs="0330"

                            we could increase monitoring of human rights abuses in Islamic republics
                            (Our latest annual human rights report, for example, contains but one
                            reference to Muslims);</p>
                        <p>—Spotlight the problems of Soviet Muslims in speeches (You have two
                            upcoming speeches before Jewish groups; specific references to Soviet
                            Islam could be included);</p>
                        <p>—End the use of Russian transliterations of Central Asian (and other
                            non-Russian) words, which amounts to our acceptance of the
                            Russianization of these non-Russian languages.</p>
                        <p>—Prepare monthly pamphlet reprints of Islamic articles appearing in the
                            Western and Soviet press for Muslim leaders and journalists;</p>
                        <p>—Translate anti-Muslim Soviet articles into Arabic and Central Asian
                            languages (We’re already doing this into Turkish);</p>
                        <p>—Work to send Korans and other religious articles into the Soviet Union,
                            and promote educational exchanges for students of Islam;</p>

                        <p>—Sponsor resolutions in international organizations on the rights of
                            Muslims (access to sacramental scriptures, educated clergy and the right
                            to propagate their faith).</p>
                        <p>—Encourage the Saudis to press Moscow to increase opportunities for
                            Soviet Muslims to make pilgrimages to Mecca;</p>
                        <p>—Ask Egypt to attempt bringing more Soviet Islamic students to Al-Azhar
                            University and ask for reciprocity;</p>
                        <p>—Urge Pakistan, Turkey, India and others to send Korans in Central Asian
                            languages to their co-religionists in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                        <p>—Seek access to Daghistan for study of classic Arabic, the one region
                            where the language is spoken as in the days of Mohammed.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issues</p>
                        <p>There are four key points around which we could center discussions about
                            Soviet religious and ethnic discrimination against Muslims:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Islam is under attack in the Soviet Union.</hi></p>
                        <p>—In 1913, there was one mosque for every 500 Muslims. Today there is but
                            one mosque for every 50,000 Muslims.</p>
                        <p>—Korans are in short supply. Only six inadequate editions have been
                            published since 1917.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviet Union is trying to pervert Islam into a variation of other
                            institutionalized (and therefore, more easily controllable) religions
                            with an official clergy. This is contrary to Islamic law.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Yet, Soviet Muslims, by virtue of their faith, have
                                developed remarkable ways to fulfill the 5 pillars of
                            Islam.</hi></p>
                        <p>—For example, while few can make the Hajj, Soviet Muslims substitute
                            pilgrimages to sacred Islamic sites within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—Vast networks of illegal Islamic secret societies exist. Thousands of
                            unregistered mullahs lead prayers and assist with circumcisions,
                            weddings, burials and dietary restrictions.</p>
                        <p>—And despite it all, demography and other sociological trends are helping
                            Central Asians advance: their birthrate is about 3 times higher than the
                            all-union average and, while their role in the central party and state
                            hierarchies is small, it is growing at the republic level.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Muslims—as an ethnic group—are
                                persecuted.</hi></p>
                        <p>—While the standard of living in Central Asia is up since the revolution,
                            income levels are lower for Muslims and infant mortality is two times
                            higher than in the rest of the country.</p>
                        <p>—Muslims are under-represented in the key institutions of state and party
                            (Only one Muslim serves on the Politburo; none in the Secretariat).</p>
                        <p>—When drafted, Muslims are conscripted to the hardest work with the least
                            chances for advancing professionally. The official explanation cites
                            language barriers, but the underlying reason is deep racial
                            prejudice.</p>
                        <p>—And ideological campaigns continue to question the basic loyalty of
                            Central Asians, again a reflection of the traditional Russian bias.</p>
                        <p>—This domestic repression clashes with the Soviet use of Muslims to
                            cultivate cultural, economic and political ties in the Third World.</p>

                        <p>—Persecutions and attacks upon unlicensed mullahs continue, the number of
                            activists on trial has increased, media attacks go on, and the
                            publication of anti-religious books still disproportionately focuses on
                            Islamic questions.</p>

                            produced only meager concrete results (four dual nationals allowed to
                            depart), the following general observations were made to us:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Soviet Foreign Ministry is prepared to discuss all emigration
                            cases (not only the U.S. representation list) with us. My interlocutor,
                            Yuri Reshetov, told me that he can henceforth be contacted directly on
                            specific cases by our Embassy.</p>
                        <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> is prepared to intercede
                            with other Soviet authorities on emigration cases at our request. Your
                            interest in the separated-spouses cases and the Nudel, Slepak and Meiman
                            cases is noted. Some of the remaining separated-spouses cases may be
                            resolved before long, others are quite difficult, one is nearly
                            impossible (a person who may <pb facs="0333" n="287" xml:id="pg_287"/>
                            once have worked for the Soviet security services). Nudel, Slepak and
                            Meiman “remain under the observation” of the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(3) Changes in emigration regulations are likely which will relax the
                            veto power of relatives of prospective emigrants over emigration
                            applications.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Commission created in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to
                            review denials of exit permits, which has already overruled some denials
                            by local offices, can be expected to overrule other such decisions as
                            well. Over time there may be some relaxation in the Soviet approach to
                            the problem of secrecy.</p>
                        <p>(5) The practices which we have labeled “abuse of psychiatry” have been
                            ended.</p>
                        <p>(6) The criminal-code provisions dealing with violations of the
                            religious-control laws and with defamation of the Soviet Union are
                            likely to be repealed and persons heretofore convicted under these laws
                            are likely to benefit from an amnesty. On the other hand, the clause
                            which makes “anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda” a crime will remain
                            in place and persons convicted thereunder (including writers of poems
                            and songs) are likely to remain in prison.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Since 1973, the human rights focus of the Helsinki process has been a
                            powerful political force putting the Soviets on the defensive and, more
                            important, reminding the world that the root cause of tension is the
                            fundamental difference between the democracy of the West and the
                            Leninist dictatorship of the East. Under <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>’s predecessors, the Soviets were always on the
                            defensive, shied away from discussions, and sought to deny the
                            legitimacy of the subject. Under the new leader<pb facs="0334" n="288"
                                xml:id="pg_288"/>ship, the Soviets have cleverly gone on the
                            offensive—embracing the issue, alleging “political prisoners” and social
                            deprivations in the West, thus seeking to neutralize the issue by
                            turning it in directions irrelevant or opposite to its original
                            meaning.</p>
                        <p>A centerpiece of the new approach is the Soviet proposal of November
                                1986<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">See <ref target="#d87fn5">footnote
                                    5, Document 87</ref>.</note> to host a conference on
                            “humanitarian cooperation” in Moscow, as part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> follow-up process.</p>
                        <p>State’s initial reaction last year was that we really didn’t like the
                            idea, but we “shouldn’t close the door;” it was bad tactics to “just say
                            no,” and in any case we should see what concessions we might extract
                            from them in the process. More recently, the United States has begun to
                            spell out in <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> what concessions we
                            want. Whether we realize it or not, it looks to me like we are now in
                            the opening phases of a negotiation over this question.</p>
                        <p>Our terms seem quite stiff, and even in the exile and dissident community
                            there is some sentiment that such concessions by the Soviets might be
                            significant enough to warrant giving them their conference:</p>
                        <p>—First, the conditions of the conference itself in Moscow must be totally
                            free. Exiles must be granted visas to come back and attend; dissidents
                            must be allowed access; Western reporters must be allowed to roam free,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>—Longer-term Soviet commitments must include, first and foremost, release
                            of political prisoners.</p>
                        <p>—Emigration must be freed up.</p>
                        <p>—Radio jamming must cease.</p>
                        <p>This list is meant to be “not exhaustive,” but the items we have
                            specified to the Soviets are essentially those above.</p>
                        <p>My concern is that these terms are not as difficult for <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> to meet as they may
                            seem:</p>
                        <p>—It’s no big deal for him to let troublemakers run around for two weeks
                            during the conference. The Soviet system will still be intact when they
                            all go home.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> is already letting
                            many political prisoners out, as part of his policy of coopting the
                            intelligentsia and lightening the hand of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1"
                                >KGB</gloss> somewhat on the populace. He can do more of this, in
                            accordance with his own strategy. The Soviets are already talking of
                            repealing one (though not all) of the statutes used to prosecute
                            dissidents.</p>
                        <p>—Emigration he can do also, whenever he decides the payoff is worth it,
                            in terms of either U.S.–Soviet relations, entree into the Middle East,
                            or now this.</p>
                        <pb facs="0335" n="289" xml:id="pg_289"/>
                        <p>—Radio jamming, even of RFE/RL,<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">Radio Free
                                Europe/Radio Liberty.</note> does not seem like the most vital thing
                            in the world for them.</p>
                        <p>Most likely, the Soviets will eventually agree to do <hi rend="italic"
                                >some</hi> of these things, perhaps amounting to <hi rend="italic"
                                >substantially</hi> if not completely meeting our demands. In a
                            predictable negotiating environment, the West then will predictably find
                            it hard—even impossible—to say no.</p>
                        <p>My main problem is that the Soviets will indeed pay a high price for such
                            a conference—<hi rend="italic">because it’s worth it to them</hi>. I
                            can’t emphasize this enough. The payoff will be intangible, but real
                            enough for them to value it highly. It confers an extraordinary
                            legitimacy on the Soviet system. As some of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Shcharanskiy</persName>’s friends expressed it to him, it’s like
                            everyone inviting the Nazis to host an international conference on race
                            relations in Berlin in 1937. And in return for a few concessions that
                            (a) are inherently reversible and (b) do not go to the basic <hi
                                rend="italic">structure</hi> of their system in the first place. The
                            Soviet system will remain what it has been; no one pretends otherwise.
                            Yet the West will now be treating the land of the Gulag as an equal
                            partner and worthy host for an international dialogue on political
                            liberty! Nothing could more completely symbolize the collapse of 15
                            years of Western human rights policy.</p>
                        <p>To me, the very idea of endorsing such a conference on such a subject in
                            such a place is obscene. And it would, as I say, represent a watershed
                            Soviet success in neutralizing Western human rights policy once and for
                            all, or throwing it into utter intellectual confusion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Shcharanskiy</persName>, too, dislikes the
                            idea, but when he was here, he told Fritz and me that he and his fellow
                            dissidents were torn. They saw the Soviet propaganda gain, but they also
                            valued the concrete concessions that might be extracted. For those in
                            the trenches, it’s a real dilemma. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Shcharanskiy</persName>’s uncharacteristic diffidence on the issue,
                            however, may also reflect his assessment that more and more governments
                            seemed to be moving in the direction of letting it take place (for a
                            price), in contrast to last year when he had the sense that governments
                            had no interest in actually having a conference. I told him that nothing
                            was decided in the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and that the
                            views of people like himself would carry great weight.</p>
                        <p>I talked to <persName corresp="#p_ZW_1">Warren Zimmermann</persName>
                            about it. He insists he will maintain total firmness on the terms we
                            have laid down. He says he too is sensitive to the moral dilemma. I
                            urged him not to do something that we’ll all be ashamed of five years
                            from now.</p>
                        <p>I am alerting you to this issue nonetheless, because I see us heading
                            into something that could prove explosively controversial. Indeed we <pb
                                facs="0336" n="290" xml:id="pg_290"/> are beginning to lose control
                            of the issue. We are heading down a path with an all-too-predictable end
                            point—and the cost to the West will be measurable by the degree of
                            pleasure and triumph that the Soviet leadership will feel even at the
                            cost to them of some concessions that they are (by hypothesis) willing
                            to pay.<note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4">In telegram 307674 to <gloss

                            unwilling to sign the agreement. Justice believes it raises all kinds of

                            define the irreducible minimum conditions to our agreeing that a Moscow
                            Humanitarian Affairs Conference be held. Before we do so, we need to
                            take inventory on Soviet progress and lack thereof in the field of human
                            rights. What a review of developments in Soviet domestic affairs
                            discloses is that the workings of the hitherto sacrosanct bureaucracy
                            have now been opened for discussion and criticism, for most Soviet
                            citizens a very exciting change. To be acceptable under these new
                            conditions, however, all such discussion must take place within a
                            framework of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Those that dissent from the
                            system continue to be harassed, but punishment is now more proportionate
                            to the seriousness of the threat posed by these dissenters than was the
                            case heretofore. <hi rend="italic">End Summary</hi>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                        <p>The willingness of the Soviets during the last year or so to listen when
                            we discuss human rights—and occasionally to respond meaningfully—their
                            significantly more friendly demeanor, and the modest steps they have
                            taken to improve their human rights record may very well have left the
                            general American public with an unrealistically complacent view of the
                            current state of Soviet human rights conditions. What is critically
                            important now, after our human rights policy has registered some modest
                            successes in the Soviet Union, is that we not leave the Soviets with the
                            impression that they have gone far enough, that we will henceforth only
                            mouth phrases about the need for further progress, but no longer mean
                            it. In the process, we will also be able to ensure that the U.S. public,
                            and Congress, have a realistic understanding of what the Soviets have
                            (and have not) done.</p>

                        <p>It is conceivable that the dynamics of change in the Soviet Union will
                            cause the process to continue. But as historians have noted, past
                            liberalization efforts were halted and reversed not only under
                            Khrushchev, but also under Alexander II and before that under Alexander
                            I. In those eras, however, before “interdependence,” Russian authorities
                            could act without reference to the concerns of outside powers. What is
                            different now is that the Soviet Union understands it must be concerned
                            about its world image and about relations with the West. It is because
                            of that concern that we have an opportunity to influence the course of
                            events in the Soviet Union. That is why we need to point both to the
                            filled and the empty portion of the glass and try to make sure that the
                            Western general public is aware of both. Our critical decision on the
                            proposed Moscow Humanitarian Affairs Conference will have to be taken
                            with these considerations in mind.</p>
                        <p>Last January I set forth for you some immediate, intermediate and
                            long-range goals of our Soviet human rights policy.<note n="4"

                            Full compliance with the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act, our
                            long-range goal, remains well over the horizon. However, in the
                            intervening months there has been significant progress in reaching our
                            immediate goals and slight progress toward the intermediate goals:</p>

                        <p>• Perhaps as many as 30% of the known prisoners of conscience have been
                            released. Additional releases have been promised. At the same time, we
                            have been told that some of these prisoners, close to 100 of those known
                            to us, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be released. They are the people
                            serving long prison sentences, some of them as recidivists, for
                            “anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.”</p>
                        <p>• A few of the separated-spouse, divided-family, and dual-national cases
                            have been resolved this year. The pace is excruciatingly slow, but
                            additional cases may be resolved in the months ahead.</p>

                        <p>• Emigration has been stepped up to an annual rate just short of our
                            minimum immediate goal of 10,000, but there is no present indication of
                            an intent to go further.</p>

                        <p>• There has been a loosening of controls on expression in that dissent,
                            speaking or writing within certain clearly defined limits, is no longer
                            punished with imprisonment, although it is otherwise interfered with
                            through harassment, detainment or confiscation.</p>
                        <p>• There has been talk of some limited changes regarding the practice of
                            religion in the Soviet Union. There have also been hints that persons
                            now imprisoned for religious activism may soon be released. But there is
                            no evident intent to change the scheme of state control of religion.</p>
                        <p>• There has been some indication that abuses of psychiatry may be brought
                            to an end.</p>
                        <p>• There has been no appreciable change in controls on the importation of
                            foreign literature.</p>
                        <p>• There has been some relaxation in controls on foreign travel.</p>
                        <p>• Steps have been taken toward greater cultural freedom, but the emphasis
                            appears on Russian culture as distinct from that of other ethnic
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>• There is no present indication of any likely change in the 1986
                            Emigration Decree (requiring invitations from immediate relatives).</p>
                        <p>• There has been no change in the intrusive status of the secret police
                            or any indication that the right to privacy will henceforth be
                            respected.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Limits of Change</p>
                        <p>The Soviets contend that such changes as have occurred recently in Soviet
                            respect for human rights have occurred for purely domestic reasons. We
                            have not tried to argue that point. In fact, some of the changes have
                            indeed been the result of a new Soviet approach to the administration of
                            its domestic affairs. But others have equally clearly been the response
                            to foreign criticism. Generally speaking, the Soviets have taken steps
                            (a) designed to make the Marxist-Leninist system function more
                            efficiently, and (b) to accommodate some Western concerns, so long as
                            such accommodation does not threaten the system.</p>
                        <p>The most exciting and for the average Soviet citizen most meaningful
                            changes in Soviet society under <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"

                            Bureaucratic failings may now be freely discussed, both in individual
                            speech and in the press. In fact, such discussion is encouraged, <hi
                                rend="italic">but only if it takes place in the context of
                                acceptance of the basic tenets of the Marxist-Leninist system</hi>.
                            Though limited in scope to the day-to-day issues of management of the
                            Soviet administrative system and economy, <hi rend="italic">this new
                                freedom allows for public discussion of almost all the problems of
                                direct concern to the great majority of Soviet citizens</hi>. It
                            similarly <pb facs="0340" n="294" xml:id="pg_294"/> allows for
                            discussion in books, theatrical plays and films of past failings, and
                            thereby permits some rewriting of official history, although only within
                            a Leninist framework.</p>
                        <p>Glasnost has not opened up for public discussion such basic policy issues
                            as the war in Afghanistan, other aspects of Soviet foreign policy, the
                            allocation of resources to the defense sector, weapons systems, the
                            composition of the Politburo, or the state’s basic commitment to
                            Marxism-Leninism. But some change has taken place in the Government’s
                            treatment of those who in speaking up or writing act beyond the borders
                            of the permissible. Responding to foreign criticism, the Soviet
                            authorities seem to have recognized that they overreacted in the past,
                            that the punishment meted out against dissent was excessive if measured
                            against the threat they posed. Dissidents whose activities are not
                            deemed to pose a serious danger to the system need not be incarcerated
                            but rather hindered in their work, so that they concentrate on what they
                            are now doing and do not get the notion that they can go further. On the
                            other hand, for dissidents who are deemed a threat, particularly those
                            who advance minority ethnic aspirations, severe punishment remains the
                            order of the day.</p>
                        <p>The best assurance that the line between the permissible and the
                            impermissible will not be crossed remains the system’s monolithic
                            control of the media and of all other forms of communications through
                            secret police monitoring of the telephones and mails and other methods
                            of spying on the population.</p>
                        <p>Soviet officials say that when they use the term “demokratisatsia” in
                            describing changes now under way in the Soviet Union they do not mean
                            Western-style democratization. That is absolutely true. They mean by
                            democratization an end to the “cult of personality,” an end to excessive
                            privileges and untouchability of the ruling class, and the notion that
                            government officials ought to pay attention to public attitudes in
                            making administrative decisions. They mean a return to Leninist purity,
                            uncontaminated by Stalinist despotism and Brezhnevist sloth. But Lenin
                            was no Western-style democrat and neither are his disciples in the
                            present Soviet leadership.</p>

                        <p>1. (Secret—Entire Text).</p>
                        <p>2. I’ve had a very constructive 45 hours in Moscow with solid progress to
                            report on both the human rights agenda for the summit and the Moscow
                            Embassy problems.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Dick Schifter</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJF_1">Jack Matlock</persName> and I spent a total of
                            five hours with <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> and an
                            hour with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Shevardnadze</persName> on human
                            rights. Gary Matthews, Mike Joyce and I spent an hour with Bessnertnykh
                            on Embassy Moscow. In between we squeezed in an emotional hour with some
                            40 or 50 refuseniks and separated families, visits to the Kremlin and
                            Red Square, the impressionist paintings at the Pushkin Museum, and a
                            magnificent performance of Giselle at the Bolshoi.</p>
                        <p>4. The Soviets announced settlement of another separated spouse case
                            today. The third in a week, leaving only six on our list.</p>
                        <p>5. At the human rights meetings with <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Adamishin</persName>, we challenged them to make progress prior to
                            the summit on our whole range of issues: 1) resolve the remaining cases
                            of divided spouses, blocked marriages, dual nationals, and “special
                            interest”; 2) resolve the remaining “old refuseniks” cases, the number
                            of which is now down to about 6,000, and stop denying emigration on the
                            basis of unreasonable allegations about access to state secrets and
                            unreasonable vetoes by relatives; 3) stop intimidating emigration
                            applicants, and accept applications only from those with close relatives
                            already abroad; 4) give amnesty to all political and religious prisoners
                            and amend their criminal code to remove provisions for such arrests and
                            imprisonments; 5) regularize other areas, e.g., to allow religious
                            classes and Hebrew language teachings, to stop censoring telephone
                            calls, mail and packages. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Adamishin</persName> said they would take these concerns under
                            consideration. On Jewish emigration he said they have no quotas, but are
                            not approving departures only for those with first-degree relatives. He
                            also quoted an astonishingly low figure for applications for Israel now
                            under consideration, and I told him this would be a problem. I also made
                            the point that now that they have contacts with Israel, we welcome their
                            bilateral discussion of Jewish emigration.</p>
                        <pb facs="0342" n="296" xml:id="pg_296"/>
                        <p>6. After setting out a number of things they would like to see us do
                            unilaterally, they came forward with a quite remarkable list of
                            proposals for future interaction, some of which we have proposed to them
                            in the past without success. These included 1) set up periodic meetings
                            between high-ranking government officials to discuss humanitarian
                            questions; 2) exchange information on the laws of both countries as they
                            affect human rights; 3) establish direct contacts between their Ministry
                            of Internal Affairs and our Justice Department on operational
                            emigration-immigration matters; 4) collaborate on the fight against drug
                            addiction and alcoholism; 5) collaborate on the fight against terrorism
                            at the operating level; 6) create a bilateral fund for humanitarian
                            collaboration to finance mutual contact and exchange of information; 7)
                            establish consultation among specialists in developing international
                            standards for committing people to mental institutions; 8) establish
                            yearly meetings between writers and publishers on human rights; and 9)
                            establish meetings between legal specialists for developing
                            international human rights standards.</p>
                        <p>7. So there is now a list of things that we want and things that they
                            want, and another list of things we might do together, many of the
                            latter list being things we want too. We will now reply in the next few
                            days and will show you a draft of our reply before it goes.<note n="2"

                            demands be asserted in a way that does not put them in the position of
                            always acquiescing to our demands but rather permits them to appear to
                            be initiating steps in accordance with their own interests. To the
                            extent that we are willing to do this, I believe we can make substantive
                            progress. They say they don’t want to keep anyone in the Soviet Union
                            who wants to leave and that they don’t want to imprison anyone for
                            political or religious reasons but that we have to help them get there.
                            There was some sense on my delegation that the Foreign Ministry may be
                            pushing in the right directions against resistance from other agencies,
                            and trying to use us in pre-summit circumstances to increase its
                            internal leverage. We shall see.</p>
                        <p>8. It is too early to know what the summit can accomplish on human
                            rights. But the indications now are that at least we can have some good
                            progress to report.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to human rights.]</p>
                        <p>12. All in all it was a good visit and a good trip. All the embassies and
                            my staff handled the complications very effectively. I’ll be back about
                            6:00 p.m. tonight.</p>

                        <p>General:</p>
                        <p>—When it comes to human rights, the Soviets are like a man who beats his
                            wife. He suddenly stops beating her and wants to be accepted as one of
                            the boys, as though it didn’t matter that he beat her in the first
                            place. The Soviets make a few human rights concessions and expect the
                            West to accept them as morally equivalent and democratic. We welcome
                            whatever concessions they make, but, at the same time, we state clearly
                            that this is not enough: there must be structural, institutional changes
                            in the Soviet system that will prevent—or, at least, put the brakes
                            on—an arbitrary reversion to the more stringent repression of individual
                            liberties that has always characterized the regime.</p>
                        <p>—There is evidence that the pendulum may in fact be swinging back toward
                            more repressive policies. <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"

                        <p>—Until recently, the Soviets tried to deflect criticism of their human
                            rights abuses by denying that abuses existed, or by charging Western
                            “interference in their domestic affairs.” That the Soviets have now
                            accepted human rights as a regular part of our bilateral agenda is a
                            victory for your unwavering commitment to human rights concerns. In this
                            respect, the Soviets have made a conscious compromise, realizing they
                            will not be able to engage the U.S. on other subjects if they attempt to
                            avoid discussion on human rights.</p>
                        <p>—Nevertheless, the Soviets are trying to impose their human rights agenda
                            on us. They have made an eight-part proposal to Undersecretary [<hi

                                    target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> that includes items we
                            do not classify under human rights—fighting terrorism and alcoholism,
                            for example. They’ve also been focusing attention on alleged U.S. human
                            rights abuses, casting almost all of them in economic terms:
                            homelessness, unemployment, absence of free medical care. In this
                            manner, the Soviets attempt to veer the discussion away from the genuine
                            human rights abuses of which they have been most guilty. We have to make
                            sure the focus stays on target.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets want the U.S. to seal its approval of their so-called
                            democratization by agreeing to their holding a human rights conference
                            in Moscow. They are pushing this idea in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> meeting in Vienna, attempting to divide the U.S. and
                            our allies on the issue. There are quite a few people who think that
                            immediate concessions on Moscow’s part might justify our acquiescing on
                            the human rights conference, but we do not agree. You should not permit
                            a government that does not respect Godgiven individual liberties and
                            does not live up to its international commitments to host a conference
                            in the name of human rights.</p>
                        <p>—Among our many human rights concerns with regard to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Emigration: The Soviets are trying to use increased emigration as a
                            bargaining chip with us. It is true that this year they have allowed
                            more people to emigrate in one month than in all of 1986, but the rate
                            still falls far short of the banner years under Brezhnev. Projecting
                            current figures, as many as 9,000 to 10,000 Jews will emigrate in 1987;
                            but more than 50,000 emigrated in 1979! There are still an estimated two
                            million Jews in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and we
                            surmise that if even 10 percent wanted to leave, an additional 200,000
                            applications would result. We have no guarantees other than Soviet
                            statements that the Kremlin will allow a free and steady flow of
                            emigrants. A new Soviet law, passed last year, actually limits rather
                            than facilitates emigration, for it restricts qualifying family
                            relationships.</p>
                        <pb facs="0345" n="299" xml:id="pg_299"/>
                        <p>b. Divided spouses/blocked marriages: The State Department still lists
                            six divided spouse cases and four blocked marriages. Instead of
                            resolving all of these cases—some which involve years and years of
                            separation—the Soviets have been letting spouses go one by one, like
                            pieces of penny candy. Dr. Galina Vileshina, a neurologist in Florida,
                            has been separated from her husband for eight and a half years.</p>
                        <p>c. Prisoners of conscience: No one knows exactly how many prisoners of
                            conscience are held in Soviet prisons and labor camps. Estimates range
                            from a low of 400 to a high of 4,000. Even one would be too many. As
                            late as two years ago, <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>
                            publicly stated that there were no political prisoners in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Many of the prisoners are believers
                            who were sentenced for teaching religion to their children—a crime under
                            current Soviet law. Many are dissidents who tried to circulate letters
                            and petitions, peacefully demonstrate against government policies, or
                            publish unofficial political or literary works. Once in the Gulag,
                            prisoners are treated brutally, are often kept in solitary confinement,
                            are denied visits from their families, and are threatened with
                            additional sentences without trial.</p>
                        <p>About 150 prisoners of conscience were released over the past year and a
                            half. Again, numbers can indicate a trend toward improvement, but we
                            still have no evidence that there are legal safeguards to protect
                            citizens from arbitrary arrest and punishment in the future.</p>
                        <p>d. Psychiatric abuse: The Soviets are still committing sane
                            people—religious, nationalist, and political dissenters—to mental
                            hospitals. They are still administering drugs that can affect mental
                            health and personality. The Soviets say they are doing something to
                            correct the situation, and have even proposed a cooperative program to
                            identity standards for committing people to psychiatric institutions.
                            The main problem remains unsolved: the Soviet Minister of Health, Dr.
                            Chazov, used to be responsible for the psychiatric establishment. He
                            apparently will not remove the persons directly responsible for system
                            psychiatric abuse.</p>

                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>2. Soviet human rights policy and practice is in a fluid, in some ways
                            paradoxical state. Overall Soviet human rights performance has improved
                            over last year, yet progress seems to have hit a plateau and in some
                            areas even rolled back. Soviet officials are demonstrating an
                            unprecedented willingness to discuss the full range of human rights with
                            us in bilateral meetings. Yet they may become victims of their own
                            success: Western expectations raised by Soviet actions and promises to
                            date are so high it will be hard to meet them.</p>
                        <p>3. This paper outlines where we have come so far in our human rights
                            dialogue with the Soviet leadership and suggests a strategy for
                            maximizing our gains in this inter-summit period.</p>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>4. Since the Reykjavik summit,<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Reference is
                                to the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>-<persName
                                    corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> summit in Reykjavik in
                                October 1986, which is covered in <ref target="frus1981-88v05"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1981–1988, vol. V,
                                    Soviet Union, March 1985–October 1986</ref>.</note> the Soviet
                            Union has made undeniable strides in the area of human rights. Early
                            this year, the Soviets:</p>
                        <p>—Increased the Jewish emigration rate, which now has reached a plateau of
                            700–900 per month, and significantly increased the emigration rates for
                            Armenians and ethnic Germans;</p>
                        <p>—Permitted greater general freedom of movement in allowing more Soviet
                            citizens to travel to the West as tourists and more former Soviet
                            citizens to return to the Soviet Union for a visit;</p>
                        <p>—Released more than 250 political prisoners;</p>
                        <pb facs="0347" n="301" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                        <p>—Showed some tolerance of political dissent, including demonstrations by
                            environmentalists, historical preservationists, Jewish refuseniks and
                            Russian, Latvian and Crimean nationalists;</p>
                        <p>—Permitted increased freedom of expression in official media, including
                            mention of formerly taboo societal problems and inclusion of articles
                            and broadcasts from Western sources;</p>
                        <p>—Ceased jamming <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> and Voice of America
                            broadcasts;</p>
                        <p>—Tolerated the formation of thousands of informal and unofficial
                            literary, cultural and political discussion groups;</p>
                        <p>—Sharply reduced the number of arrests and convictions on political and
                            religious grounds.</p>
                        <p>5. In general, however, the Soviets have failed to give permanency to the
                            steps they have taken by making appropriate changes in their laws or
                            procedures. They have repeatedly promised institutional reforms, such as
                            changes in the criminal code or in the way “State Security” refusals are
                            handled. But what they have delivered is relatively little: An end to
                            the use of “internal exile” as a punishment, the transfer of “special
                            psychiatric hospitals” from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry
                            of Health, and, in the last few weeks, a slightly more flexible attitude
                            toward the requirement that applicants for emigration have their
                            relatives’ permission.</p>
                        <p>6. Indeed, the Soviets almost appear to be engaged in a program of
                            experimentation to test the parameters of reform. In some cases the
                            Soviet leadership seems to have defined the limits of these freedoms by
                            cracking down when they advance too far. The Soviets have slowed their
                            progress, or even retreated from previous gains, in the following
                            areas:</p>
                        <p>—They have failed to release the remaining political and religious
                            prisoners, known to be in the hundreds and estimated to be in the
                            thousands;</p>
                        <p>—This fall they harshly repressed demonstrations similar to those
                            tolerated in the summer, arresting and beating demonstrators and in one
                            case detaining a Western news correspondent;</p>
                        <p>—They have recently stepped up harassment of leaders of informal
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>7. To forestall further retreats and to ensure that the change is
                            long-lasting, we have urged the Soviets in bilateral meetings and in the
                            Vienna <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> follow-up meeting to
                            institutionalize their human rights progress. We specifically have urged
                            the following steps:</p>
                        <p>—A significant increase in emigration, involving a repeal of the
                            requirement of all applicants to receive permission of all relatives,
                            and a liberalization and codification of the laws and regulations
                            governing refusals on grounds of secrecy;</p>
                        <pb facs="0348" n="302" xml:id="pg_302"/>
                        <p>—Release of all remaining political and religious prisoners, including
                            those in psychiatric institutions, and repeal of the political and
                            religious criminal code articles on which many of them were
                            convicted;</p>
                        <p>—Resolution of all remaining cases on the U.S. Government’s
                            representation list;</p>
                        <p>—Continued unjamming of foreign radio broadcasts;</p>
                        <p>—Expanded freedoms for religious believers.</p>
                        <p>8. These suggested reforms were intended to end the most egregious of
                            Soviet violations, without requiring fundamental change to the Soviet
                            system. In this connection, many of the suggestions are based on Soviet
                            trends and promises.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-Soviet Human Rights Dialogue</p>
                        <p>9. As Soviet progress on human rights has tapered off, Soviet authorities
                            ironically have demonstrated greater willingness to discuss these
                            issues. As recently as last year, the issue of human rights had to be
                            disguised before it would rate Soviet consideration. For the December
                            summit meeting, the Soviets freely agreed to include human rights on the
                                agenda.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">Reference is to the <persName

                            year, the Soviets have also agreed to consider human rights in the
                            Bilateral Review Commission, in periodic case review sessions in Moscow,
                            and in preparatory sessions before all high-level meetings between U.S.
                            and Soviet officials. In such meetings, the Soviets have recently
                            demonstrated an unprecedented willingness to discuss principles, laws,
                            and practices as well as reviewing in detail specific cases from lists
                            we provide. On the other hand, they have also stepped up their human
                            rights counterpunches, expressing sharp criticism of social and economic
                            conditions in the United States, and they continue to be interested in a
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> humanitarian conference to be
                            held in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>10. During his meetings with President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> and in public statements, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> was visibly testy on the
                            subject of human rights, stressing that the U.S. is not the “prosecutor”
                            and the Soviet Union is not the “accused.” Despite such proclamations,
                            Soviet officials in the working groups engaged in extensive review of
                            the Soviet human rights situation, including many individual cases. Like
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>, they attempted to
                            offset our criticism of their system with attacks on ours.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Increased Expectations</p>
                        <p>11. Soviet statements and actions on human rights over the past year have
                            created expectations in the West that may now prove difficult <pb
                                facs="0349" n="303" xml:id="pg_303"/> to fulfill. Non-governmental
                            organizations have carefully documented Soviet statements on proposed
                            reform, such as emigration and criminal code changes, and now expect
                            these changes to be implemented. If progress levels off, as it seems to
                            have already, let alone if there is a retreat, then pressure from these
                            constituents to push the Soviets will increase. Indeed, representatives
                            of several human rights organizations have already indicated that they
                            are disappointed with summit results on human rights.</p>
                        <p>12. We now face a situation where we can discuss human rights with the
                            Soviets at all levels but where real progress is once again elusive. We
                            need a strategy that allows us to pocket the Soviet willingness to look
                            into cases of interest to us while at the same time taking advantage of
                            their unprecedented willingness to contemplate institutional reforms
                            that would have lasting significance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategy Leading Up to the Next Summit</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Resist Soviet Attempts to Sidetrack or
                            Trivialize Our Human Rights Dialogue.</p>
                        <p>13. Not only have the Soviets stepped up their attempts to counterattack,
                            citing alleged U.S. human rights violations, but they have been doing
                            their homework more diligently. During the human rights working group
                            sessions at the summit, they came prepared with voluminous materials on
                            these subjects, and they used them for hours of discussion on, among
                            other things, the plight of the unemployed and homeless in the United
                            States. Several hours were also devoted to the Soviet recital of
                            resolved cases from many different lists.</p>
                        <p>14. There is no escaping the fact that the human rights dialogue with the
                            Soviet Union, if it is to take place at all, will have to be a two-way
                            street. We should nevertheless concentrate our time and energy at
                            high-level meetings on principles related to civil and political
                            liberties and to emigration. Discussions on the number of square meters
                            in a Soviet apartment or the number of persons who enter the U.S. each
                            year from Mexico should be referred to talks between U.S. and Soviet
                            experts on such subjects, which can be arranged. They are not
                            appropriate to meetings surrounding a summit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Continue to Press on Institutionalization of
                            Reforms.</p>
                        <p>15. Institutional changes should be our first concern, because they
                            affect large numbers of persons, many of whose names are completely
                            unknown in the West, and because they will help ensure that any progress
                            made will be more difficult to reverse. While the Soviets are now
                            willing to discuss and to resolve individual cases, we should not
                            sacrifice discussion of procedural and legal reform in our effort to
                            bring these cases to the Soviets’ attention.</p>
                        <pb facs="0350" n="304" xml:id="pg_304"/>
                        <p>16. When we ask for procedural reforms, we will be starting from a strong
                            position. The Soviets have been promising us these reforms for several
                            months, even though what they have delivered has been disappointing.
                            They have told us on several occasions that they are considering changes
                            in laws that have been used frequently against political and religious
                            dissidents. They have also said on several occasions that they are
                            considering modifications in the way they deal with “state security”
                            refusals. We therefore have solid grounds to press for action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Coordinate Fora.</p>
                        <p>17. The recent willingness on the part of the Soviets to discuss human
                            rights has left us with several fora in which to air our concerns. We
                            regularly review human rights issues in the Bilateral Review Commission,
                            in periodic case review meetings held between our diplomats in Moscow
                            and their Soviet counterparts, at the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> meeting in Vienna, and in all high-level meetings
                            between U.S. and Soviet officials. We should take advantage of all these
                            frequent opportunities for human rights review, but we should coordinate
                            to ensure that we are conveying the same signals and priorities across
                            the board.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Make Case Review More Systematic.</p>
                        <p>18. In a departure from past practice, the Soviets have demonstrated a
                            willingness to review carefully all lists we provide them and to respond
                            with status updates. Although the information they provide is frequently
                            out-of-date or simply false, this process does prove useful and has
                            contributed to significant progress on all of our representation
                            lists.</p>
                        <p>19. We must be careful, however, to control the lists so as not to
                            undermine our own credibility or wear out the new-found Soviet
                            receptivity to them. The increase in dialogue has led to a proliferation
                            of lists that has confused both us and the Soviets. We should keep the
                            number of lists to a minimum, keep them at a manageable size, be sure
                            they are accurate, and establish as our priority those cases which are
                            of particular interest to the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>20. If we should decide to present lists as a statement, such as lists of
                            all known refuseniks or all political prisoners, we should make clear to
                            the Soviets that we do not expect a read-out on each case but are simply
                            seeking the resolution of the entire category.</p>

                        <p>21. During Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1"
                                >Whitehead</persName>’s visit to Moscow, Soviet officials proposed a
                            number of areas for potential cooperation in the <pb facs="0351" n="305"
                                xml:id="pg_305"/> area of human rights.<note n="4" xml:id="d102fn4"
                                >See <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> Many of the
                            proposals reflect initiatives, such as periodic human rights review, we
                            have already undertaken. Others, such as proposals to exchange laws and
                            to engage in in-depth discussion about emigration/immigration questions,
                            would cover new ground and should be pursued. Still others are either
                            not desirable, such as the creation of a humanitarian cooperation fund,
                            or should be arranged through private channels, such as meetings between
                            writers and legal specialists.</p>
                        <p>22. We should pursue some of these proposals, because their
                            implementation may serve to dissolve concentrations of opposition to
                            reform in the Soviet bureaucracy. In agreeing to them, however, we
                            should avoid the following pitfalls:</p>
                        <p>—Creating the perception among the allies that we are cutting a separate
                            deal on human rights. We must emphasize to the allies and the Soviets
                            that we see such bilateral cooperation as establishing a firmer
                            foundation for multilateral work, rather than eliminating the need for
                            that work.</p>
                        <p>—Producing more documents, such as declarations by writers and lawyers,
                            when in fact it is improved implementation that we seek.</p>

                            making the following points:</p>
                        <p>—Human rights was at the top of our agenda for the summit.</p>
                        <p>—We conducted more than 12 hours of talks with the Soviets on human
                            rights issues, including productive case review.</p>
                        <p>—The brief reference to human rights in the joint statement reflects
                            fundamental differences in how we and the Soviets view our human rights
                            obligations.</p>
                        <pb facs="0352" n="306" xml:id="pg_306"/>
                        <p>—Nevertheless, it is the first time human rights has been acknowledged to
                            form a part of the U.S.–Soviet dialogue in such an authoritative
                            way.</p>
                        <p>—Our resolve to advance human rights certainly has not diminished.</p>
                        <p>—On the contrary, we have stressed to the Soviets that human rights
                            issues form an integral part of the bilateral relationship. They will
                            not go away.</p>

                        <p>Under the emigration decree announced in November 1986,<note n="2"

                            numbers affected, is the provision that an applicant for an exit permit
                            must produce an invitation from a spouse, parent, child, or sibling
                            living abroad. This provision, which disqualifies the great majority of
                            potential applicants, was rigidly applied to new applicants (as distinct
                            from Refuseniks) in the early months of 1987. We raised objections to it
                            then. Thereafter, on the occasion of their visit to Moscow, <persName

                            emigration of Russians, Ukrainians, etc., but that it would be
                            interpreted “flexibly” in dealing with certain other groups. A few
                            months later the word appeared to have gotten down to the lower echelons
                            and we began to notice that persons sponsored by more distant relatives
                            were indeed allowed to leave the Soviet Union. The “flexible
                            interpretation” benefited all three emigrating groups, Armenians,
                            Germans and Jews.</p>

                            that the only applications for exit permits that will be denied will be
                            those of persons who possess secret information. That is also what we
                            were told in our December 8 and 9, 1987, Human Rights Working Group
                            sessions by Soviet Foreign Ministry officials. Only later did we find
                            out that a Communist Party Central Committee staffer who had been in the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> party at the
                            Summit had warned some of his U.S. interlocutors that there would be a
                            drop in emigration after January 1, 1988. (This means that the Foreign
                            Ministry officials deliberately misled us or were uninformed. I think it
                            was the latter.)</p>
                        <p>As it is, there has been no discernible drop in emigration as yet.
                            However, the flow of new applications is being reduced by not accepting
                            those filed by persons not sponsored by first-degree relatives and even
                            returning some applications which had been filed earlier.</p>
                        <p>We can’t be sure why the Soviets have once again tightened their
                            emigration rules. It is worthy of note, however, that in early 1987 the
                            number of Jews applying for exit permits was low, which may have caused
                            the Soviet authorities to loosen the restrictions. Toward the end of
                            1987 there was a sudden-surge of new applications, which may have
                            alarmed the Soviets, causing them to turn off the tap once again.</p>

                            troublesome and embarrassing. It is embarrassing because the President
                            announced after the Summit that he was hopeful regarding future
                            developments concerning emigration from the Soviet Union. As he put it:
                            “There were assurances of future, more substantial movement, which we
                            hope to see become reality.”<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">For the full

                        <p>We cannot be certain what the impact of this policy change will be on the
                            present pattern of Jewish emigration, which appears to be at the rate of
                            10,000 annually. There are three possibilities. First, it is <pb
                                facs="0354" n="308" xml:id="pg_308"/> conceivable that there is a
                            sufficient stream of eligible emigrants so that the present rate can be
                            maintained while keeping the restriction in place. More likely, the
                            present rate cannot be maintained once the present backlog is exhausted
                            with the restriction in effect, leading (a) to a drop in the rate of
                            emigration, or (b) once again to a relaxation in the rule. We obviously
                            will want to press for the latter.</p>

                        <p>At our February 17 meeting, you requested that we consult with the Senate
                            prior to signing the Convention. Representatives from our two
                            Departments met last Friday with staff members of the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee to inform them that we planned to go ahead with
                            signature in the very near future and to brief them on our package of
                            reservations, understandings and declarations.</p>
                        <p>You also requested that the State Department pledge to resist unjust
                            attempts by foreign governments to prosecute U.S. officials for torture.
                            It goes without saying that the State Department will do everything in
                            its power to protect U.S. officials from unjust prosecutions by foreign
                            states. My Department would be happy to include language in the Senate
                            transmittal document stating that the U.S. Government would <pb
                                facs="0355" n="309" xml:id="pg_309"/> strongly resist attempts by

                            prosecutions against U.S. citizens.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this resolves the remaining issues between our two
                            Departments. Unless we hear otherwise from you, we plan to go ahead with

                            declarations at the time of ratification, without appearing to preempt

                            in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> terms, there was no further need

                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> is extremely pleased with the
                            outcome as are the other members of the Western Group. The Cubans have
                            paid a high price to evade the adoption of a U.S. resolution on Cuba,
                            the acceptance of a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> investigative
                            team and the placement of Cuba’s human rights situation on the agenda at
                            the 45th Session of the <gloss target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss>. The
                            U.S. resolution had been torn down to a minimum—in real terms, we have
                            gotten much more than we ever expected possible. Cuba has, in practical
                            terms, been placed in the same boat as Afghanistan, Iran, Chile, and El
                            Salvador, with rapporteurs carrying out a full investigation of the
                            human rights situation. This puts us at least one to two years ahead of
                            what our resolution would have eventually accomplished. The Cuban
                            attempt to co-opt the issue by extending an invitation to the <gloss
                                target="#t_HRC_1">HRC</gloss> on Cuban terms has been turned against
                            them. The invitation has been accepted, but on <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> terms. The GOC will undoubtedly seek to sabotage this
                            investigation at every turn as they have already tried (see para 11);
                            the fact is Cuba has suffered a major loss.</p>
                        <p>7. While Cuba was not prepared to have its invitation altered to meet
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> terms (Sene’s announcement came
                            as a surprise to the Cuban Delegation), the positions of some
                            delegations became more fluid as a result of Cuba’s “conciliatory”
                            invitation. To have pushed to a vote on our text would have required our
                            overcoming several possible procedural votes. In the end, we are almost
                            certain that a vote on our text would have resulted in its adoption, but
                            some of the procedural votes would have been risky.</p>
                        <p>8. We want to get across to addressees that it was only the forceful
                            efforts of all involved, particularly our embassies, that prompted the
                            Cuban invitation—something that as little as two weeks ago Castro said
                            he would never contemplate. What has been created in effect is a group
                            of six <gloss target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss> Special
                            Rapporteurs—something that was worth giving up our text for. <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> is extremely grateful for the
                            efforts of all.</p>
                        <p>9. Much work lies ahead to ensure that at next year’s <gloss
                                target="#t_UNHRC_1">UNHRC</gloss>, Sene’s report will be the basis
                            of a resolution which accurately reflects the human rights situation in
                            Cuba. It goes without saying that the Cubans will pull out all the stops
                            to secure the opposite result.</p>
                        <p>10. Begin text of Colombian draft decision (informal English
                            translation):</p>
                        <p>Taking into account the invitation of the Cuban Government, the Human
                            Rights Commission decides:</p>
                        <p>A. To accept this invitation for the Chairman and five members of the
                            Commission, named after regional consultations, to visit Cuba with the
                            goal of observing the situation regarding matters of human rights.</p>
                        <p>B. That the President of the Commission, jointly with the other five
                            members of the mission, draw up a report which will be presented <pb
                                facs="0358" n="312" xml:id="pg_312"/> for the consideration of the
                            Commission, which will decide the form in which this (information) will
                            be examined. End text.</p>
                        <p>11. At what was to be the routine closure of the Commission on March 11,
                            Cuba’s four puppets, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina, tied up
                            proceedings for four hours trying to alter technically the agreement of
                            the previous day. In the end they lost, and by so doing put some
                            frosting on the cake prepared the previous day.</p>
                        <p>12. Once again, our apologies to all for our incessant requests for
                            lobbying, and our profound thanks for the way those requests were

                            context. I suggest that for now we proceed on the assumption that the
                            withdrawal is taking place.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">In the left-hand

                        <p>4. A “significant” rise in emigration. It is now running at the rate of
                            9,000–10,000 a year. Our present thinking is to ask for an immediate
                            rise in the monthly numbers so as to give a 1988 end-of-year total of
                                15,000.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">In the left-hand margin,

                            move promptly on all cases in which the applicant has not done any
                            secret work for ten years or more.</p>
                        <p>We have also told the Soviets we need such institutional reforms as
                            freedom of religion, reform of the criminal code, and removal of abuses
                            barring emigration. Rather than insisting on immediate performance, we
                            could tell them that we remain committed to these criteria, and—if they
                            are not met by the time of a Moscow conference—we would have to discuss

                        <p>The Madrid forum established a pattern under which a human rights experts
                            meeting and a separate meeting on human contacts (family reunification,
                            etc.) would take place between the end of Madrid and the beginning of
                            the Vienna meeting three years later. We can agree to have a third such
                            meeting. The French would like to have a human rights meeting in 1989;
                            the Danes would like to host a human contact session, and that could
                            also take place in 1989. Each of these would probably last four to six
                            weeks. We could then have a Moscow conference in 1990 designed to review
                            implementation and take inventory as to where the Helsinki Final Act
                            stands with respect to these two broad issues. The fact that it is an
                            additional meeting to follow <pb facs="0360" n="314" xml:id="pg_314"/>
                            the other two means there is a standard of how to hold meetings to which
                            the Soviets will be asked to conform. The next big follow-up meeting
                            will then take place in Helsinki in 1991, three years after Vienna.</p>
                        <p>Holding a Moscow meeting, once our conditions are met, should, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> suggested, assist
                            Soviet human rights activists. I’m not suggesting that we “reward” the
                            Soviets by holding the conference. It is in our interests if we are able
                            to use it as a lever for better human rights performance. Many human
                            rights groups in the U.S. now support the idea. On the other hand, Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName> is now opposed,
                            although her representatives have suggested that the fulfillment of our
                            conditions may turn her around. In any event, you will see that I am
                            proposing that we explore this question with the Soviets and not make
                            any commitments until after we obtain Alliance consensus.</p>

                        <p>I would like to propose, subject to your agreement, that I be authorized

                            exploration of U.S.–Soviet relations in which the above agenda would be
                            a major item. This is a good follow-up to your talk with <persName

                            U.S. and Soviet experts explained laws and implementation of laws in
                            each of our two countries regarding involuntary psychiatric commitment;
                            the interrelationship of domestic and international law concerning human
                            rights; capital punishment; and freedom of conscience.</p>
                        <p>4. Interesting trends and patterns in this first meeting were:</p>
                        <p>—The Soviet approach was initially combative, forcusing on U.S. failure
                            to ratify the International Human Rights Covenants. As the meeting
                            progressed, however, rapport was established between the two sides,
                            particularly with Yakovlev. Yakovlev went quite a distance in conceding
                            human rights problems in the Soviet Union and indicating Soviet interest
                            in effecting basic changes. At the conclusion of the meetings, he
                            indicated that he had been somewhat apprehensive and was pleasantly
                            surprised at how well things had gone. He expressed his strong interest
                            in continuing the dialogue.</p>
                        <p>—Generally, <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> noted that
                            there are three channels for discussions of humanitarian issues between
                            the U.S. and Soviet Union: 1) between the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> and the State Department, 2) between lawmakers (e.g.
                            Congressman Hoyer’s upcoming trip to Moscow), and 3) between experts
                            such as were attending the current roundtable meeting. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> expressed hope that, as part
                            of Perestroyka, expert-to-expert meetings could go on without needing
                            continual shepherding by Ministries, but not totally beyond governmental
                            control. He also suggested that a non-governmental source of financing
                            be established to support symposia between experts, a sort of bilateral
                            human rights fund.</p>
                        <p>—Yakovlev and Milekhin were the only two genuine experts brought by the
                            Soviets; Vlasikhin, as noted below, served as polemicist, and employing
                            his knowledge of the U.S. and of English to advance arguments which in
                            toto were a thinly disguised lure in the direction of moral equivalence
                            thinking. Yakovlev was thoughtful and well-prepared; he may very well be
                            an important person in such studies of Soviet legal and judicial reform
                            as may be underway. Milekhin seemed, disingenuously or not, surprised
                            that U.S. professionals would have considered that Soviet psychiatrists
                            would have abused their profession; but this wore off, or was abandoned,
                            during the two days, and he appears to be interested in further
                            dialogue.</p>
                        <p>—Despite the ups-and-downs of the preparatory period; the unpromising
                            exchanges embassy went through over whether meeting would take place;
                            what agenda would be; and so on, the round table discussions quickly
                            came to the point. No lingering or footdragging <pb facs="0363" n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317"/> came from the Soviet side, once here; and this may
                            be instructive for future planning of such meetings.</p>
                        <p>PSYCHIATRY</p>
                        <p>5. The discussion of psychiatric commitments centered around (1)
                            balancing the need to protect society from dangerously insane persons
                            and the need to protect the individual’s rights, and (2) the interplay
                            between legal and medical issues in the treatment of psychiatric
                            patients. The U.S. side presented an overview of the types of
                            psychiatric treatment given in the U.S., how many psychiatric patients
                            are treated against their will, the differences between civil
                            commitments and criminal commitments, etc. The Soviets focused on their
                            concept of alleged safeguards against abuse of psychiatry, such as the
                            role of the procurator, who functions as quote an Ombudsman unquote in
                            the Soviet legal system to ensure compliance with the law. Yakovlev
                            conceded that laws regarding psychiatric commitment had not always been
                            followed in the past. The position of chief psychiatrist was created to
                            deal with organizational questions, local party officials have been told
                            to deal with all complaints, and local Soviets are required to help
                            place mental patients back into society. A discussion of technical
                            aspects of appointing a guardian ensued.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to questions about the mistreatment of mental patients, as
                            described by Anatoly Koryagin and Viktor Davydov, in special psychiatric
                            hospitals, Dr. Milekhin simply dismissed the notion that psychiatry
                            could be abused for political purposes. He maintained that incorrect
                            diagnoses must be examined individually, and cannot be clinically
                            discussed in general terms. Later, Milekhin defended the existence of
                            special psychiatric hospitals from which a patient cannot escape as
                            necessary in order to protect society and hospital personnel from
                            dangerously sick people who do not themselves know they require
                            treatment. The Soviets also described the procedure for judicial review
                            of emergency commitment which, according to Milekhin, was recently
                            codified. Though the issue of Soviet abuse of psychiatry was not pressed
                            on Milekhin in the course of the formal meetings, it was forcefully
                            brought to his attention in private conversations with Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Schifter</persName> and with Ellen
                            Mercer of the American Psychiatric Association. At the end of the
                            meeting, Milekhin asked an <gloss target="#t_HA_1">HA</gloss> officer
                            somewhat plaintively whether Americans really believe that Soviet
                            psychiatrists have been guilty of misdeeds. He was assured that we
                            did.</p>
                        <p>7. An invitation was extended by Dr. Milekhin to U.S. psychiatrists to
                            visit the Serbskiy Institute and lecture to Soviet psychiatrists, and
                            the Soviet psychiatrists were invited to reciprocate the visit here.
                            During Milekhin’s first day in Washington the American Psychiatric
                            Association (<gloss target="#t_APA_1">APA</gloss>) received him at its
                            offices here and arranged for visits to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GCE_1">George</persName> Washington University

                            Suggested topics for a series of future symposia on psychiatry include
                            judicial review of involuntary psychiatric commitment and treatment,
                            both civil and criminal; legal protections for psychiatric patients; and
                            the insanity defense.</p>
                        <p>Relationship of Domestic and International Laws on Human Rights</p>
                        <p>8. The discussions on relations between domestic and international laws
                            on human rights began with the Soviet Union enumerating the human rights
                            conventions to which it is a party, such as the International Covenant
                            on Economic and Social Rights; the Covenant on Civil and Political
                            Rights; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and the Helsinki
                            Final Act. They then went on to describe how “glasnost” has led to
                            changes in the legal and economic spheres and greater democratization in
                            the political sphere.</p>
                        <p>9. A/S <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Schifter</persName> brought this
                            discussion back from the theoretical to the practical by pointing out
                            that laws are not self-enforcing, and that implementation is vital.
                            Vlasikhin (whose overall role was provocative, defensive, and out of
                            sync with the other Soviets) responded with a presentation on several
                            topics including: the importance of having an independent judiciary;
                            U.S. non-ratification of human rights covenants, such as the Genocide
                                Convention;<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">See <ref target="#d72"

                            conservatives unquote; restrictions on demonstrations in the U.S.,
                            alleged violation of attorney/client privilege by lawyers; infiltration
                            of the Committee to Aid El Salvador by the FBI as a restriction on
                            freedom of expression, and the increasing threat to privacy in the U.S.
                            posed by computers. The U.S. side pointed out that the openness of our
                            system, as demonstrated by the Freedom of Information Act, ensured that
                            such problems would come to light, and be dealt with. We noted that any
                            reform in the Soviet Union comes about after internal policy changes,
                            not public scrutiny and discussion. We also questioned the extent to
                            which principles found in the international accords are adhered to in
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>10. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Schifter</persName>
                            suggested that future discussions focus on trying to clarify the terms
                            of what was agreed to in the Helsinki Final Act. All 35 member states
                            would ultimately need to be involved in formally defining the terms, but
                            the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could bilaterally
                            start that debate. Yakovlev did not pick up on this suggestion, but
                            noted that it was useful to discuss real mechanisms of implementation
                            and of actual experiences with problems.</p>
                        <pb facs="0365" n="319" xml:id="pg_319"/>
                        <p>11. The March 25 morning session opened with A/S <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR_1">Schifter</persName>’s suggestion that polemics be
                            put aside, and discussions center on areas which <persName
                                corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> identified as needing change
                            under quote Perestroyka unquote. An independent judiciary would be a
                            worthwhile subject of discussion, while free elections were too far from
                            the Soviet reality to be a worthwhile topic.</p>
                        <p>Capital Punishment</p>
                        <p>12. The discussion of capital punishment elucidated the circumstances in
                            both countries under which such punishment could be imposed. Vlasikhin
                            told us that a debate is under way in the Soviet Union over limiting
                            capital punishment, and whether or not to abolish it altogether for
                            economic crimes. Both sides agreed that the death penalty for first
                            degree murder would probably remain in place in both countries, due to
                            public outrage at particularly savage crimes. The Soviets said they
                            would find it useful to examine U.S. experience in establishing
                            standards for capital punishment, and the role of the jury in meting out
                            the death penalty. The Soviets are considering instituting an augmented
                            collegium of people’s assessors in cases involving capital offenses,
                            rather than the usual two people’s assessors. Philosophical discussion
                            of the deterrent and punitive aspects of capital punishment took place,
                            generally reflecting differences between the benefits and drawbacks of a
                            pluralist, federalist system as opposed to a centralist system.</p>
                        <p>13. Yakovlev said that the parties involved in revising the Criminal Code
                            are the Ministry of Justice; his Institute of Law, a research institute
                            under the procurator system known by the acronym PP (Sic: with a name so
                            long he could not remember it),<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">Not further
                                identified.</note> the Legal Departments of the Presidium of the
                            Supreme Soviet, the Commission of Legislative Projects in the Supreme
                            Soviet, and various working groups of scholars. The five-year plan for
                            revising the Criminal Code covers 38 items which are grouped into eight
                            sections comprising three major groupings: A) development of democracy,
                            self-management, and rights and freedoms of citizens, B) economic
                            management and the national economy, and C) social questions. Some of
                            the specific changes being considered are: decriminalization of
                            homosexuality; decriminalization of drug use; replacement of forced
                            labor with detention in colonies or settlements; instituting jury
                            trials; restricting the number of crimes punishable by imprisonment;
                            abolition of Article 190–1; allowing pre-trial meetings with attorneys;
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>14. We, in turn, suggested discussing limits on the power of police
                            authorities; requirements for issuance of arrest and search warrants;
                                <pb facs="0366" n="320" xml:id="pg_320"/> interception of mail;
                            wiretaps; and electronic surveillance. We indicated that we would be
                            prepared to discuss the implementation of restraints on the FBI in
                            carrying out investigations, wiretaps, etc. Vlasikhin said there was a
                            suggestion afloat in the Soviet Union to have warrants approved by
                            judges instead of the procurator (who serves as the prosecutor) and
                            agreed to recommend this topic to Moscow. However, Yakovlev was not as
                            eager to pursue it, and preferred to have further discussions on the
                            legal procedure for imposing the death penalty, and the appeals process.
                            Another suggested topic which came up was the mental competency of a
                            defendant to stand trial.</p>
                        <p>Freedom of Conscience</p>
                        <p>15. The last session (March 25 afternoon) covered freedom of conscience.
                            The U.S. side gave detailed explanations of the laws protecting
                            religious freedom, including the rights of atheists, and the separation
                            of church and state. The Soviet side gave a historical perspective of
                            the close ties between church and state under the Tsars, and what they
                            viewed as the resultant strong opposition of the Bolsheviks to the
                            Orthodox Church and to all existing religious faiths. As Yakovlev put
                            it: We substituted a new religion for the others. The U.S. side brought
                            up the repression of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, the imprisonment of
                            Lithuanian Catholic priests, requirements for registering religious
                            groups, limitations on teaching religion to children, and offered to
                            send Bibles to the Soviet Union to alleviate the shortage (see below).
                            The Soviets mentioned that 435 new religious associations and groups had
                            been formed in the last few years. They enumerated the numbers of
                            churches of different denominations, mosques, and synagogues in
                            existence, and pointed to the return of cathedrals and monasteries to
                            the church as church property. They explained that separation of church
                            and state in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> did not allow
                            for the teaching of religion in state schools, and that any religious
                            instruction outside of the family would be considered a school, and
                            would be prohibited as contrary to the Soviet Constitution. They also
                            said a new edition of the Bible would be issued before June 13 in honor
                            of the millenium of Christianity, but that the limited numbers would not
                            satisfy the demand, that Burlatskiy’s<note n="6" xml:id="d107fn6">Fyodor

                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> be brought up to date, and that the
                            revisions in that law were being actively drafted now. Some proposed
                            changes would give a religious organization the rights of a legal
                            person, and also give religious associations the opportunity to
                            participate in charity, the conservation of historical and cultural
                            monuments, and other expanded rights. In response to a U.S. comment, the
                            Soviets admitted that reli<pb facs="0367" n="321" xml:id="pg_321"/>gious
                            associations were sometimes arbitrarily denied the right to register, or
                            to engage in practices such as ringing church bells, because of quote
                            local abuse unquote of administrative authority. They expressed a hope
                            that the state would ensure that legally given rights were not impinged
                            in future. In response to a comment by A/S <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                                >Schifter</persName> that the arbitrariness of local authorities
                            seemed to get worse the further one got from Moscow, the Soviets quoted
                            the saying that God is in heaven, and the Tsar is far away.</p>
                        <p>16. The U.S. side pointed out that there seemed to be de facto toleration
                            of religious instruction, and asked whether that could be codified by
                            amending Articles 142 and 227 of the RSFSR Code.<note n="7"

                            The Soviets spoke of the need for reform of Soviet law to bring more
                            quote equality unquote between believers and non-believers. None of the
                            specific questions asked by the U.S. side were answered with

                            between health and legal aspects of psychiatric issues and insisted they
                            be treated separately. The following legal topics for further discussion
                            were suggested:</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">SUMMARY</hi>. Responding to our urgings, the Soviets
                            seem to have decided late in 1986 or early in 1987 to let most
                            Refuseniks leave the country. Their emigration was spread out over about
                            a year and, except for about 2,000 persons known to us who are still
                            denied exit permits as well as any of whom we may never have heard, most
                            of them (about 11,500) have now left. With regard to new applicants, the
                            Soviets initially tried to discourage such filings, and succeeded. Less
                            than 700 new applicants left in 1987. However, since the middle of
                            February 1988 the Soviets have been processing new applications in
                            larger <pb facs="0369" n="323" xml:id="pg_323"/> numbers and with few
                            restrictions, so that the months ahead may see further increases in
                            Jewish emigration from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The
                            Soviets can, of course, turn the valve off again at any time they
                            desire. <hi rend="italic">END SUMMARY</hi>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Sufficient time has now elapsed since the change in Soviet Jewish
                            emigration policy in 1986 to be able to interpret the statistics, define
                            the new policy on the basis of the statistical evidence, and analyze the
                            possibilities as to future trends.</p>
                        <p>Clearly responding to U.S. urgings (it would not otherwise have been a
                            high-priority issue) the Soviets adopted in 1986 a new emigration
                            decree, to take effect on January 1, 1987. Early in 1987 emigration
                            figures for Americans, Germans and Jews did, in fact, tilt sharply
                            upward and have since then continued at a level substantially above that
                            of the years 1982–1986.</p>
                        <p>Close examination of the Jewish emigration issue reveals that the Soviets
                            adopted a two-track policy in early 1987: one governing Refuseniks and
                            another governing new applicants.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Refuseniks</p>
                        <p>The list of Refuseniks which you arranged to transmit to the Soviets in
                            1986 (furnished to us by the National Conference on Soviet Jewry)<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">Not found.</note> contained the names of
                            about 11,000 persons. The Soviets have told us since then that there
                            were, in fact, about 17,500 Jewish Refuseniks. When approached by the
                            Soviet authorities in 1987, about 4,000 indicated that they no longer
                            wanted to depart. (This number presumably also includes those who had
                            died in the interim.) Of the remaining 13,500, about 85% were granted
                            exit permits while 15% were turned down once again.</p>
                        <p>Rather than allowing the newly approved ex-Refuseniks to leave promptly,
                            their departure was spread out over a period of more than a year. That
                            was accomplished by rationing the issuance of exit permits to about 800
                            per month. By now, except for a few stragglers, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >approved</hi> ex-Refuseniks have left the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>About 2,000 persons known to us remain in Refusenik status, more than 80%
                            of them on the ground that they (or their close relatives) are in
                            possession of secret information, the remainder because a member of the
                            family has been unable to obtain parental permission to emigrate. In
                            addition to those known to us there may also be a number of
                            “low-profile” Refuseniks of whose identity we are unaware.</p>
                        <pb facs="0370" n="324" xml:id="pg_324"/>
                        <p>Almost all of the security denials involve persons who quit their jobs so
                            long ago that their information cannot reasonably be presumed to be
                            secret. Furthermore, the requirement of parental concurrence in
                            emigration (of adults!) simply does not make good sense. It would follow
                            logically that both of these grounds for denying permission to emigrate
                            seem to have been resorted to not just for the sake of the remaining
                            Refuseniks, but to control and possibly suppress the emigration impulse
                            of those who have not heretofore applied for emigration.</p>
                        <p>In recent months we have been told to expect new legislation on the
                            subject of security denials and parental consent which will ameliorate
                            the situation of the remaining Refuseniks. This, too, suggests that
                            there is a relationship between this remaining Refusenik group and the
                            Soviet Union’s concern about the rules under which future applicants
                            will be processed.</p>
                        <p>We have urged our Soviet interlocutors not to wait for the approval of
                            new rules, but to keep processing the remaining Refusenik cases.
                            Specifically, we have urged them to subject them to thorough review in
                            the chronological order in which they left their security-sensitive
                            work, starting with those longest removed from such work. The Soviets
                            have agreed to do that.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The New Applicants</p>
                        <p>The 1986 decision to let the bulk of the Refuseniks go was not
                            accompanied by a decision to open up Jewish emigration generally. A new
                            requirement, sponsorship by first-degree relatives living abroad, to be
                            applied to first-time applicants but not to Refuseniks, was to
                            disqualify the vast majority of potential exit permit applicants. Other
                            requirements, such as the need to obtain the consent of all siblings
                            remaining in the Soviet Union, were designed to add to the hurdles which
                            new applicants would have to overcome. Moreover, after the new
                            emigration decree took effect at the beginning of 1987, many new
                            would-be applicants were told by Soviet emigration offices that these
                            offices were too busy and that the applicants should come back a few
                            months later.</p>
                        <p>This policy of discouragement was indeed successful. The number of new
                            applicants during the first half of 1987 was quite low. Of the about
                            3,000 Jews who were allowed to leave the Soviet Union in the first half
                            of 1987, about 50, less the two percent, were new applicants. As our
                            complaints about Soviet policy continued to be voiced, the Soviets
                            relaxed their restrictions on new applicants slightly during the middle
                            of 1987. Though no official announcement was made to that effect, the
                            first-degree relative requirement was no longer applied rigidly. New
                            applications then began to rise, with the result that during the second
                            half of 1987, out of 5,000 Jewish emigrants, about 600 or, 12%, were
                            first-time applicants.</p>

                        <p>Then came January 1, 1988 and a new clamp-down on first-time
                                applicants.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">See <ref target="#d103"
                                    >Document 103</ref>.</note> While the remaining Refusenik cases
                            continued to be processed without reference to the provisions of the
                            1986 emigration decree, the restrictions provided for in that decree
                            were once again fully applied to anyone filing a new application. Some
                            new applicants whose papers had been accepted toward the end of 1987 had
                            them returned.</p>
                        <p>As soon as we were convinced that the Soviets had once again resorted to
                            a harsh policy of restrictions and were applying it in all cities from
                            which we had news, we protested strongly. Two weeks after we had
                            delivered our protest, around the middle of February, the Soviets once
                            again relaxed their restrictions, assuring us that the restrictive
                            policy had been reimposed “through bureaucratic oversight.” They also
                            told us, for the first time, that the first-degree relative requirement
                            would be waived for all applicants for exit permits to Israel and that
                            this waiver would remain in effect for all of 1988. We promptly passed
                            this information to the interested organizations and soon thereafter the
                            number of applications began to rise significantly.</p>
                        <p>Chances are that the reimposition of the restrictive policy on January 1,
                            1988, which remained in effect for about seven weeks, was more than a
                            bureaucratic error. It is likely that when Jewish emigration was again
                            authorized in 1986, it was decided to open the gates for most
                            Refuseniks, but to prevent an avalanche of new applications. When few
                            new applications were filed, the Soviets may have decided to loosen the
                            restrictions somewhat. Then, when the number of applications began to
                            climb, the Interior Ministry decided to clamp down again. After we had
                            protested, the Foreign Ministry must have interceded and the leadership,
                            as a further accommodation to us, may have decided to reverse the
                            Interior Ministry.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for the last 90 days prospective Jewish emigrants have come forward
                            with the knowledge that the first-degree relative requirement does not
                            stand in their way. The only legal restrictions in effect are, as in the
                            case of Refuseniks, knowledge of secrets and the parental consent
                            requirement. <hi rend="italic">We need to note that a clearcut, open and
                                known policy as to the treatment of new applicants has thus been in
                                effect only since about February 17, 1988</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Even with this policy in effect, there is one other potential control on
                            the number of exit permits issued: processing delay. We have already had
                            reports that long lines are now forming in front of local offices
                            handling emigration applications. (One such office, I was told, <pb
                                facs="0372" n="326" xml:id="pg_326"/> accepts applications for exit
                            permits only on Wednesdays. A line of applicants begins to form Monday
                            night.)</p>
                        <p>Thus, since last February the principal question has been at what pace
                            the Soviets will be prepared to process new applications. At first it
                            appeared that monthly Jewish emigration totals had moved up to 1,000. We
                            have now been told that in April 1,400 exit permits were issued.
                            Moreover, in that month about 2,800 new applications were accepted for
                            processing. The months immediately ahead may thus reflect a further
                            turn-up in monthly departures. Just how far the monthly figures will go
                            depends on how many applications are accepted each month and how fast
                            they are processed. The rate of emigration thus reflects a policy
                            decision taken probably at a high level in the Soviet hierarchy. The
                            question before us is whether the Soviets have decided to allow a
                            breakthrough to a substantially higher level of emigration than the
                            800–1,000 per month figure allowed so far, whether they will stick close
                            to the present emigration level, or whether they will, as is also
                            possible, cause the emigration totals to go down again.</p>
                        <p>Just how many likely applicants there are we do not really know. The
                            estimate which is often used is 400,000, which would be about 20 percent
                            of the Soviet Jewish population. The Soviets say this estimate is far
                            too high. Whatever the number may be, it is clear that the rate at which
                            the Soviets will allow applications to be processed will continue to
                            depend on the interest the United States takes in this issue.</p>
                        <p>Note: A problem still on the horizon, which may lead to complications in
                            the future, is the continuing effort of the Israeli government to see to
                            it that all recipients of Israeli emigration invitations do in fact
                            travel to Israel. The waiver by the Soviets of the first-degree relative
                            requirement applies only to Jews who receive invitations from Israel.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he wished to digress for a
                            minute and hand <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> a
                            list, as he had done on previous occasions. The United States was a
                            country to which people came from all over the world, and many of them
                            maintained an interest in the countries they had come from. All the
                            cases on the list had been brought to his personal attention, by
                            relatives and friends, and he wanted to mention two specifically.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>The first was that of Yuriy Zieman. He was a writer. His children were in
                            America, and he was seriously ill, and wished to come to America for
                            medical treatment. <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he had
                            wanted to visit him. Zieman’s children wanted to do something for him,
                            if not to cure him, at least to ease his illness. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> continued that he would not go
                            through the whole list; there were a dozen or so. But for some reason he
                            felt a particularly affinity to one man on the list, Abe Stolar. He was
                            an American, whose parents had come to America in the time of the czars.
                            He had been born on the very same day as the President, in the state of
                            Illinois, so they had been born not many miles apart. When Stolar was
                            young, he and his parents returned to Russia, and his son had eventually
                            married a young lady in Russia. Now they had all decided they wanted to
                            return to the land where Stolar was born, the United States, and the <pb
                                facs="0374" n="328" xml:id="pg_328"/> Soviet government gave
                            permission to all but the daughter-in-law. So they all decided to stay
                            behind until they could leave together. As Stolar put it, he wanted to
                            die where he was born, and the President thought the Soviet authorities
                            should allow the whole family to leave. He hoped he would not die on
                            same day as Stolar, even though they were born on the same day. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            responded that as always when the President presented specific
                            humanitarian problems to him, especially concerning departures, these
                            would be given careful attention. There was no obstacle to departure
                            from the Soviet Union but one—possession of state secrets—and that was
                            natural, since all countries wished to protect such secrets. But
                            basically the Soviets did not keep people against their will. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi>
                            went on to say that on the eve of his departure, in his statements in
                            the U.S., in Washington, in Helsinki, the President had spoken about
                            raising human rights in Moscow. <hi rend="italic"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName></hi> said with a smile
                            that he felt it was incumbent upon him to respond, since otherwise,
                            people might feel the President had him (<persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName>) in a corner, and that more pressure should be
                            put on him. He wanted to say that they in the Soviet leadership were
                            ready to work with the U.S., with the Administration and with the
                            Congress, on an ongoing basis, for solutions to humanitarian problems.
                            He was saying that because he was convinced of it, and because it was
                            quite clear that both in the Administration and in the Congress there
                            were people who did not have a clear idea of what the human rights
                            situation really was in the Soviet Union.</p>

                            went on to say that the Soviets had many comments to make about the U.S.
                            human rights situation; about problems of political rights, the rights
                            of blacks and colored people, social and economic rights, the treatment
                            of anti-war protesters and movements. They got many facts from the U.S.
                            press. Probably they still did not know everything well. But they were
                            ready to listen to what the U.S. side had to say. They were ready to
                            have a conversation with the U.S. Congress. <hi rend="italic"><persName

                            and academics of the two sides, to discuss what was happening in the two
                            countries. (S)</p>
                        <p>It was not just a question of cases, <hi rend="italic"><persName

                            generalizations with which the Soviets disagreed; the U.S. probably
                            heard some things it disagreed with on the Soviet side, too. But these
                            things should be discussed. The Soviets were open to that kind of
                            discussion. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he knew what <persName

                            true, as it was anyplace, because the U.S. was a big and varied country.
                            It had many races, and one race, the blacks, had once been <pb
                                facs="0375" n="329" xml:id="pg_329"/> slaves. They were then freed,
                            and discriminating against them was now illegal, but all the individual
                            prejudices could not be immediately overcome. Some people in our country
                            had brought them with them when they immigrated. But there was one
                            difference: the U.S. had passed laws, and under the law no one could use
                            prejudice to keep someone from getting a job, finding housing, getting
                            an education, and the like. That would be against the law, and that
                            person would be punished under the law, not because of his race or
                            religion. (S)</p>

                            responded that there were many declarations and many provisions in the
                            U.S. Constitution and U.S. laws. The problem was to look at how they
                            were implemented in real life. If one looked at figures on unemployment
                            of Blacks and Hispanics, on per capita income of Whites and Blacks, on
                            access to education and health, there were big differences. In the
                            Soviet Union, living standards were lower, even much lower than in the
                            United States, but there was nothing like such large contrasts among
                            groups of people in the country when it came to pay and the like.

                            the United States. Recently, the Soviets had become much more
                            self-critical, but the U.S. had not. Once the Soviets had begun to be
                            self-critical, it seemed that the U.S. spoke more about civil and
                            ethical rights. Of course, the President was completing his term as

                                >Gorbachev</persName> had liberalized some of its rules—the Orthodox

                            said that the Soviets judged the problem of religion in the Soviet Union
                            as not a serious one. There were not big problems with freedom of
                            worship. He, himself, had been baptized, but was not now a believer, and
                            that reflected a certain evolution of Soviet society. There was a
                            difference of approach to that problem. The Soviets said that all were
                            free to believe or not to believe in God. That was a person’s freedom.
                            The U.S. side was actively for freedom, but why did it then happen that
                            non-believers in the U.S. sometimes felt suppressed. He asked why
                            non-believers did not have the same rights as believers. <hi

                            meant a certain infringement of their freedom. It meant there was a
                            limitation on their freedom. He read the U.S. press. There should be

                            in the United States. Religion could not be taught in a public school.
                            When we said freedom, that meant the government had nothing to do with
                            it. There were people who spent considerable money to build and maintain
                            schools that were religious. He had heard <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"

                            contributions. There were people volunteering to restore churches. In
                            our country the government could not prevent that, but could not help it
                            either. Tax money could not be spent to help churches. It was true there
                            were private schools, with the same courses as public schools but with
                            religious education besides, because people were willing to pay to
                            create and support them. But in public schools supported by taxes you
                            could not even say a prayer. (S)</p>

                            said that after the Revolution there had been excesses in that sphere.
                            As in any revolution there had been certain excesses, and not only in
                            that sphere but in others as well. But today the trend was precisely in
                            the direction the President had mentioned. There had been some conflicts
                            between the authorities and religious activists, but only when they were
                            anti-Soviet, and there had been fewer such conflicts recently, and he
                            was sure they would disappear. And when they spoke of perestroika, that
                            meant change, a democratic expansion of democratic procedures, of
                            rights, of making them real; and that referred to religion, too. (S)</p>

                            Constitution. There were some people—not many, but some—who were against
                            war. They were allowed to declare themselves conscientious objectors,
                            when they could prove that it was a matter of faith with them not to
                            take up arms even to defend their country. They could be put in uniform
                            doing non-violent jobs—they could not escape from service—but they could
                            not be made to kill against their religion. In every war there were a
                            few such people, and sometimes they performed heroic deeds in the

                            that, if he died in battle, God would accept him. That piece of paper
                            was found on the body of a young Russian soldier who was killed in that
                            battle. (S)</p>

                            responded that he still felt the President did not have the full picture
                            concerning freedom of religion in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had
                            not only many nationalities and ethnic groups, but many religious
                            denominations—Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim, various denominations of
                            Protestants, like the Baptists—and they practiced their religion on a
                            very large scale. The President would meet the Patriarch, would go to
                            one of the monasteries. If the President asked him, the Patriarch would
                            tell him about the situation concerning religion in their country.

                            said he would like to make one more suggestion. It was true that they
                            did not have much time to do much that was new. But they should try to
                            work not just for the present but also for the future. Perhaps the
                            President would give thought to opening up even greater cooperation in
                            space between the two countries. If that came out of this meeting as a
                            common desire, that would be a good result. The two countries had good
                            capabilities and doing something jointly would be a very big thing. It
                            was very difficult for one country to operate in space. As he had
                            already said to the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, now the
                            Soviets would like the U.S. to begin cooperation on a joint mission to
                            Mars. He understood this would be a long-term project; it meant lots of
                            work and could not be accomplished overnight. But it was important to
                            begin, and cooperation would be very useful. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that the U.S. program had been
                            set back by the Challenger tragedy. But he had asked his people to look
                            into the General Secretary’s suggestion. Space was in the direction of
                            heaven, but not as close to heaven as some other things they had been
                            discussing. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"

                            agreed that experts from both countries would begin joint consideration
                            of various aspects of such a program.” (S)</p>

                            said he was very pleased with this first discussion. It confirmed that
                            the two leaders were still on very friendly terms. He hoped this meant
                            they were truly beginning to build trust between the <pb facs="0379"

                            conveyed it to the President—that they were just beginning to be on good
                            terms with the Administration, and along came an election. But he still
                            wanted movement; there was still time to accomplish many things. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> concluded that there was one thing
                            he had long yearned to do for his atheist son. He wanted to serve his

                                is attached but not printed.</note> the Israeli Cabinet has now
                            formally decided to pursue “direct flights” for Soviet Jews as a means
                            of eliminating the high numbers of potential immigrants who currently
                            “drop out” in Vienna en route to Israel. In December 1987 you authorized
                            discussion of this problem within the Department and with the Department
                            of Justice and the <gloss target="#t_INS_1">INS</gloss>, as appropriate
                            (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3">Tab B, dated December 7, 1987, is
                                attached but not printed.</note> once it was confirmed that direct
                            flights would actually take place. The Israeli Cabinet decision has not
                            yet been implemented, but it would be prudent for us to assume that it
                            will be. Accordingly, this memorandum presents our recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Soviet law limits eligibility for emigration to persons who are sponsored
                            by “first-degree” relatives (spouse, parent, child or sibling) living
                            abroad. Those with such a sponsor may be granted exit permission for the
                            country of the sponsor. This “first-degree-relative” requirement has
                            been waived for ethnic Germans emigrating to W. Germany, Armenians
                            emigrating to the U.S., and Jews emigrating to Israel. Thus, a Soviet
                            Jew may receive an exit permit if sponsored by an Israeli cousin, but
                            not if sponsored by a U.S. cousin. That is why most Soviet Jews qualify
                            only for emigration to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Under the Israeli plan, Jewish emigrants who have “vyzovs” (invitations)
                            from Israel would be able to obtain Israeli immigrant visas only if they
                            proceed to Romania. We expect that Israel, in order to implement this
                            plan, will instruct the Dutch to cease issuing visas to Soviet Jews in
                            Moscow, thus leaving Romania as the only feasible location for Soviet
                            Jews to obtain Israeli immigration visas. As a practical matter, it is
                            extremely unlikely that Romania will permit such persons to “drop out”
                            and travel to any destination but Israel.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch, who represent Israel’s interests in Moscow, currently issue
                            Israeli immigration visas for those Soviet Jews who transit Vienna.
                            Although Israel will soon open a consular affairs office in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, it appears that the Dutch may
                            continue to issue some Israeli visas after that date (i.e., the Soviets
                            may not allow Israeli consular officials in Moscow to issue visas). To
                            date, the Dutch have not received formal instructions reflecting the
                            Israeli Cabinet’s decision. When they do receive such instructions, they
                            will have to decide whether to comply or to stop issuing Israeli visas
                            entirely.</p>
                        <p>At present, Soviet Jews who have Israeli immigrant visas travel to
                            Austria on an Austrian transit visa. Unless Austria changes its
                            policies, these people will not qualify for Austrian transit visas if
                            they do not <pb facs="0381" n="335" xml:id="pg_335"/> have an Israeli
                            immigrant visa. The absence of an Israeli visa will thus eliminate the
                            option for Soviet Jews to travel to Vienna and onward to the United
                            States. Even if Jewish emigrants do possess Austrian transit visas, we
                            do not know if the Soviet authorities would permit them to depart for
                            Vienna if they have Soviet exit documentation for Israel but no Israeli
                            visa.</p>
                        <p>Under present U.S. law, persons are “firmly resettled” once they arrive
                            in a country that permits them to remain there on some sort of permanent
                            basis. (See current U.S. refugee regulations at Tab C.)<note n="4"

                            This test is easily met in the case of Soviet Jews arriving in Israel,
                            because the Israeli “law of return” automatically grants any recognized
                            Jew the right to remain there.</p>

                        <p>Given these circumstances, preservation of the ability of Soviet Jews to
                            come to the United States may depend upon a change in Soviet or Austrian

                        <p>The Soviets allow this kind of flexibility for Jews who receive “vyzovs”
                            from Israel, and for Armenians going to the U.S. and ethnic Germans
                            going to West Germany. We should ask the Soviets to extend the waiver of
                            the “first-degree relative” requirement to Jews sponsored by persons in

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Rule of Law</p>
                        <p>When we first suggested to the Soviets that we make the rule of law a
                            major topic in our human rights dialogue, we knew, of course, that this
                            was a subject to which General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1"
                                >Gorbachev</persName> was paying a great deal of attention. What we
                            had not anticipated is that it would become one of the major concerns of
                            Soviet reformers. But Thesis Eight of the Ten Central Committee Theses
                            for the Nineteenth Party Conference (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2"
                                >Not found.</note> made the rule of law one of the major reform
                            goals and the Conference adopted a resolution which underlined the
                            importance of legal reform as one of the goals of Perestroyka (Tab
                                B).<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>This was the background against which our July 11–13 meetings took place
                            in Moscow. Solicitor General Charles Fried, Assistant Attorney General
                            (Criminal Division) Edward Dennis, and former Deputy Attorney General,
                            now Judge Lowell Jensen had traveled to Moscow to participate in
                            discussions with the Soviets on the rule of law. There were about 20
                            Soviet participants in our meetings. In addition to Deputy Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> and his
                            staff, they included representatives of the Soviet Ministry of Justice,
                            the Institute of State and Law (the country’s principal legal think
                            tank), the Chief Procurator’s (prosecutor’s) office, law schools, the
                            bar, and the bench (including the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the
                            Russian Soviet Republic, and the Vice Chairman of the Supreme Court of
                            the Soviet Union). Some of the participants were “old thinkers,” but
                            they kept fairly quiet. On the <pb facs="0384" n="338" xml:id="pg_338"/>
                            Soviet side the discussions were dominated by “new thinking” and many
                            thoughtful questions were posed to our side.</p>
                        <p>In our talks we moved rapidly from generalities to specifics. For
                            example, on the subject of an independent judiciary, we were asked
                            questions about the advantages and disadvantages of lifetime tenure for
                            judges. There was interest in our discussion of the jury system,
                            particularly as to the nature of the relationship between a judge and a
                            jury. We discussed the respective roles of the court, the prosecution,
                            and the defense in the preliminary investigation of a criminal case. (In
                            the Soviet Union the courts are not at all involved until a case goes to
                            trial, with warrants issued by the prosecutor rather than a judge.
                            Defense counsel does not enter the case until after the investigation
                            has been completed and the defendant has been charged.) We also
                            discussed the power of U.S. courts to declare laws unconstitutional and
                            executive acts unlawful.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Soviet participants indicated that they were now
                            participating in the groups charged with responsibility for revising
                            Soviet legal procedures. The questions which they were asking related to
                            issues which they are actively considering. The American experience was,
                            therefore, of great interest to them. Once our meetings were over, a
                            number of Soviet participants told me that they found the discussions
                            most useful as they had picked up information on our legal system of
                            which they had not been previously aware.</p>
                        <p>The American participants, in turn, found the entire experience most
                            interesting and indicated to me that they would be prepared to
                            participate actively in further work with the Soviets. Judge Jensen has
                            told me that he would be prepared to travel to Washington for the next
                            set of meetings.</p>
                        <p>The way matters were left was that the Soviets would propose an agenda
                            for a meeting in Washington early in the fall. They urged that highly
                            specific topics be selected, that both sides prepare papers on each
                            subject and exchange them prior to the meeting. The American side
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>We have now established a relationship between the top professional level
                            of the Department of Justice and the key players in the Soviet Union in
                            the legal reform effort. I hope that before this Administration leaves
                            office, we shall have institutionalized this relationship.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Psychiatry</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have heretofore agreed, in principle, to a visit by American
                            psychiatrists to the Soviet Union to discuss questions of forensic
                            psychiatry and to visit psychiatric institutions and examine present and
                            former patients. Though we have not formally labeled it as such, it
                            would be an inspection visit to check whether the Soviets have indeed
                                <pb facs="0385" n="339" xml:id="pg_339"/> abandoned the practices
                            which have heretofore been characterized as abuse of psychiatry.
                            Responding to an invitation from the Soviets, we submitted the outlines
                            of a proposal which would involve our Department and the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> as well as the Department of Health
                            and Human Services and the Soviet Ministry of Health. The Soviets took
                            our proposal and told us they will get back to us on it soon.</p>
                        <p>On our side, the government agency to be involved at the professional end
                            of this effort will be the National Institute of Mental Health (a part
                            of <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>). It will work closely with the
                            leadership of the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
                        <p>I have every reason to think that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> is working on this issue in good faith. I suspect it
                            has the support of the Communist Party Central Committee staff. But it
                            is clear that the Soviet psychiatric leadership is literally being
                            dragged along. The Soviet psychiatric leaders are making a concerted
                            effort to outflank the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> and us. They
                            are doing this through Dr. Chazov, the Soviet Minister of Health and
                            1984 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize (for his leadership in “Physicians
                            Against Nuclear War”). Chazov has gotten in touch with Dr. Lown of the
                            Harvard Medical School, his co-Nobel laureate. Lown has been in touch
                            with a psychiatrist, also at the Harvard Medical School, by the name of
                            Lester Grinspoon.</p>
                        <p>Grinspoon started earlier this year to put together a group of
                            psychiatrists who would visit the Soviet Union, but after hearing about
                            our undertaking got in touch with me. I told him that as an American
                            citizen he was free to do whatever he wanted to in accepting or not
                            accepting a Soviet invitation to visit the Soviet Union for the purpose
                            of examining psychiatric institutions. I added, however, that if the
                            Soviets have really brought psychiatric abuse to an end, it would be
                            better all around for that fact to be acknowledged by a group whose
                            objectivity was beyond question, which would include past critics of
                            Soviet behavior, rather than a group of psychiatrists who have
                            heretofore been silent on Soviet abuse and have been involved with the
                            Soviets in “peace” organizations, suggesting a political bias. So far,
                            Grinspoon has agreed with this analysis and has not accepted the
                            repeated invitations from the Soviet psychiatric profession.</p>
                        <p>The nervousness of the Soviet psychiatrists can easily be understood.
                            What the reform has done, as far as I can tell, is get persons out of
                            psychiatric hospitals who have been committed for political or religious
                            activities. As far as we can tell, there have been no new commitments
                            for political or religious reasons during the last 18 months or so. A
                            law has been enacted which makes psychiatrists criminally liable if they
                            wrongfully commit a person to a psychiatric institution. The Special
                            Psychiatric Hospitals have been transferred from the Ministry of the
                            Interior to the Ministry of Health. Some judicial review of <pb
                                facs="0386" n="340" xml:id="pg_340"/> psychiatric commitments is now
                            contemplated. But—and this is another one of the compromises which
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> seems continuously
                            be forced to agree to—the past abusers of psychiatry are still in place.
                            It won’t be easy for American psychiatrists to agree to what in
                            Argentina is called the “punto final,” pardoning past transgression. But
                            the <gloss target="#t_APA_1">APA</gloss> officials with whom I have
                            discussed this matter tell me that if they are convinced that the Soviet
                            Union has turned over a new leaf, they are going to work with whoever is
                            in charge in the Soviet Union, in the hope that they can get past the
                            old crew to work with younger people who are untainted.</p>

                        <p>We have been told that Soviet changes in certain practices are to be
                            institutionalized by changes in the legal codes. The code provisions

                            activity crimes are to be repealed or significantly modified. The law on
                            religion is to be amended so as to take care of many of the concerns
                            which we have expressed in the past. The emigration law is to be amended
                            so as to allow the children of parents who refuse their consent to
                            emigration to litigate this issue in the courts. The revised law is also
                            to specify criteria for the denial of exit permits on security grounds.

                            By the time of my Moscow discussion, eight of these cases had been
                            resolved, leaving a balance of ten. My Soviet interlocutors indicated
                            that four of the remaining cases were likely to be resolved in the near
                            future, all of them imprisonment cases. They were those of Father
                            Svarinskas, Lukyanenko, Rusak, and Gayauskas. Since I left Moscow, one
                            of the cases, that of Father Svarinskas, has in fact been resolved. We
                            have thus reached the halfway mark of resolved cases on the President’s
                            list.</p>

                        <p>We received a detailed response to our list of political and religious
                            prisoners. The Soviet answer acknowledges the present status as
                            prisoners of some of the people on our list, tells us that others have
                            been released, and tells us further that some of the names on our list
                            are unknown to them. We are now in the process of analyzing this
                            response.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">6.</hi> Emigration</p>
                        <p>We discussed our U.S. Rep list and our Refusenik cases. Recent progress
                            on these lists is quite limited.</p>
                        <p>As to new applicants for exit permits, the Soviets told us that during
                            the first half of 1988 about 36,000 exit permit were granted, including
                            16,000 to the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, 8,000 to the United
                            States, 8,000 Israel, and 4,000 to other countries. For the first time
                            in over half a year I was not given exact figures regarding the backlog
                            of applications as of the first of the month of cases ready for
                            processing. Instead I was given “incomplete estimates.” I construe this
                            to mean that the number of applications for exit permits has increased
                            so sharply that the Soviets are afraid to admit it.</p>
                        <p>One new development, which became clear only after my departure from the
                            Soviet Union, is Soviet willingness to open up emigration for
                            Pentecostals. Ethnically, most Soviet Pentecostals are either Russian or
                            German. German Pentecostals leave under the German emigration program.
                            Russian Pentecostals leave on exit permits for Israel as if they were
                            Jews. In this manner the Soviets avoid setting a precedent for unlimited
                            emigration of ethnic Russians. During the month of July about 25 percent
                            of the ostensibly Jewish emigrants arriving in Vienna have been, in
                            fact, Pentecostals. There is every reason to think, therefore, that
                            Pentecostals have become the fourth group authorized to emigrate from
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it looks to me as if the figures of ethnic Jews leaving
                            the Soviet Union in July is down from the June figure. We have to see
                            whether this is an aberration or a new trend.</p>

                            of opinion within Soviet government circles is clear. The fact that such
                            a split exists was freely admitted by Deputy Foreign Minister <persName

                            policy and could make a great contribution to further improvement in our
                            bilateral relations. His response was: “All you ever worry about is our
                            relations with you. We also have to worry about our relations within our
                            own country.”</p>

                        <p>Dear Ron,</p>
                        <p>We face a very important decision on how to deal with the Soviet proposal
                            for a <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Human Rights meeting in
                            Moscow. Our consistent pressure for an improvement in human rights in
                            the Soviet Union is achieving results, thanks in particular to the way
                            in which you took the argument to the heart of the Soviet system during
                            your own visit to Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Reference is to

                                    <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> We need to keep
                            up our pressure: not polemically, but persistently to ensure that the
                            improvement is sustained.</p>
                        <p>I worry that the suggestion that we should now agree to a human rights
                            meeting in Moscow will be taken by the Soviet leadership as a sign that
                            we think that the Russians have done enough and will be used by them for
                            propaganda purposes. Moreover, our support and advocacy has hitherto
                            sustained those individuals in the Soviet Union who have shown such
                            courage in campaigning for human rights in their own country. All their
                            hopes and faith will crumble if they think we have been hoodwinked into
                            agreeing to a Moscow Human Rights Conference. There is still a very long
                            way to go before the Soviet Union truly accepts that human rights are
                            God-given and cannot be taken away by the state. A year ago, the United
                            States Government set out the sort of human rights criteria it would
                            expect the Soviet Union to meet.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">See <ref

                            propose now is that we should aim to agree clear, specific criteria
                            which would have to be met, and be seen to be met, if the West was to
                            consider attending a conference in Moscow. If the two of us can do this
                            we should be able to persuade our other allies to rally to that
                            position. Without such clear criteria, the Soviet Union would have every
                            opportunity to backslide on their commitments, and we who have been so
                            true to our commitment would be thought to have forsaken it.</p>

                        <p>Dear Margaret:</p>
                        <p>Because your own judgement in matters relating to East-West issues is so
                            sound, and because I know how closely you have followed events in
                            Vienna, I especially valued your letter of Decemer 21<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d113fn2">In telegram 418636 to London, December 30, the
                                Department transmitted the text of <persName corresp="#p_TM_1"
                                    >Thatcher</persName>’s December 21 letter, which acknowledged
                                progress on Soviet human rights, but cautioned against Soviet
                                backsliding. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File, [no
                                film number])</note> on the Moscow Human Rights Conference.</p>
                        <p>Given all that has occurred over the past several months, I believe the
                            time has come to respond positively to the Soviet request to host a
                            Human Rights Conference in 1991. True, we have not gotten all we wanted
                            from the Soviets, but we have made substantial gains beyond what you or
                            I could have expected even a year ago. Much progress has been registered
                            in resolving political and religious cases. Emigration rates are up.
                            Jamming has ceased. The institutionalization of reform has been promised
                            to the world by <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I believe we must now look to how we can best preserve and extend our
                            advances, and it seems to me that this means we should <pb facs="0390"
                                n="344" xml:id="pg_344"/> agree now to a Moscow conference in 1991
                            as part of a package of <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> follow-on
                            meetings. Like you, I am determined to keep the faith with those who
                            have fought so courageously for human rights in the Soviet Union, and to
                            do what we can to prevent Soviet backsliding. This means we are prepared
                            to monitor carefully implementation of actual human rights reforms,
                            including those <persName corresp="#p_GMS_1">Gorbachev</persName> has
                            promised for 1989. I also believe we have established a process that
                            will maintain continuous pressure on the Soviets and encourage further
                            progress. It goes without saying that if there is major backsliding or a
                            significant reversal of present trends, we and other allies as well
                            would wish to review our participation in Moscow in 1991.</p>
                        <p>Given this situation, I hope you can join with us in accepting a Moscow
                            conference. It would be our current plan to signal our acceptance on
                            Tuesday, January 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">The White House made the
