                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is a series of
                    volumes of diplomatic correspondence published by the Department of State for
                    each year beginning with 1861 (excepting 1869). The regular annual volumes have
                    been supplemented by special volumes on particular subjects. For the period
                    beginning with 1914 these extra volumes have included World War Supplements for
                    the years <ref target="frus1914Supp">1914</ref> to <ref
                        target="frus1918Supp01v01">1918</ref> inclusive; volumes on Russia for the
                    years <ref target="frus1918Russiav01">1918</ref> and <ref

                        1919</ref>, these last named volumes being still in the course of
                    publication.</p>
                <p>The compiling and editing of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes
                    is performed by the Research Section in the Division of Research and Publication
                    in accordance with the principles set forth in an order approved on March 26,
                    1925, by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. This order, which is
                    still in force, is given here in full: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The publication of diplomatic correspondence relating to matters which
                            are still current often presents an insuperable obstacle to effective
                            negotiation, but it is obvious that after the completion of the business
                            in hand, as much of the correspondence as is practicable ought to be
                            made public. This object is attained by the publication of <hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> which presents, in a form
                            economical, compact and easily accessible, the documentary history of
                            the foreign relations of the United States. The editing of <hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> must, therefore, be recognized
                            as an important part of the duties of the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the Division of Publications [Division of Research and
                            Publication] is changed with the preparation for this purpose, as soon
                            as practicable after the close of each year, of the correspondence
                            relating to all major policies and decisions of the Department in the
                            matter of foreign relations, together with the events which contributed
                            to the formulation of each decision or policy, and the facts incident to
                            the application of it. It is expected that the material thus assembled,
                            aside from the omission of trivial and inconsequential details, will be
                            substantially complete as regards the files of the Department.</p>
                        <p>The development of the science of international law has become a matter
                            of such weight and general concern that it is recommended that the Chief
                            of the Division of Publications [Division of Research and Publication],
                            with the help and counsel of the Solicitor [Legal Adviser], should give
                            special attention to the publication of all important decisions made by
                            the Department relating to international law, with a view to making
                            available for general study and use the annual contributions of the
                            Department to this important branch of jurisprudence. It is likewise
                            believed that the Department may profitably inaugurate the practice of
                            printing a record of treaty negotiations, and it is, therefore,
                            suggested that such material be added, beginning with <ref
                                target="frus1918"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations
                                1918</hi></ref>, which is now in the process of editing.</p>
                        <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>
                        <p>When the documents on a given subject have been assembled in the Division
                            of Publications [Division of Research and Publication], they should be
                            submitted to the Solicitor [Legal Adviser] or to the Chief of the
                            appropriate division which has had immediate supervision of the topic.
                            The Solicitor [Legal Adviser], or the heads of these divisions,
                            respectively, are charged with the duty of reviewing the material thus
                            assembled and indicating any omissions which appear to be required.
                            Omissions of the following kind are recognized as legitimate and
                            necessary: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Matters which if published at the time would tend to embarrass
                                    negotiations or other business;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>To condense the record and avoid needless details;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by other
                                    governments and by individuals;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                <item>To avoid needless offense to other nationalities or
                                    individuals by excising invidious comments not relevant or
                                    essential to the subject; and,</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
                                <item>To suppress personal opinions presented in despatches and not
                                    adopted by the Department. To this there is one qualification,
                                    namely, that in major decisions it is desirable, where possible,
                                    to show the choices presented to the Department when the
                                    decision was made.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there must be no alteration of the text, no deletions
                            without indicating the place in the text where the deletion is made, and
                            no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a
                            decision. Nothing should be omitted with a view to concealing or
                            glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of a
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Where a document refers to two or more subjects, provided there are no
                            other objections, it should be printed in its entirety, and not divided
                            for purposes of more exact classification in editing. Great care must be
                            taken to avoid the mutilation of documents. On the other hand, when a
                            foreign government, in giving permission to use a communication,
                            requests the deletion of any part of it, it is usually preferable to
                            publish the document in part rather than to omit it entirely. A similar
                            principle may be applied with reference to documents originating with
                            the American Government.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the Division of Publications [Division of Research and
                            Publication] is expected to initiate, through the appropriate channels,
                            the correspondence necessary to secure from a foreign government
                            permission to publish any document received from it and which it is
                            desired to publish as a part of the diplomatic correspondence of the
                            United States. Without such permission, the document in question must
                            not be used. The offices and divisions concerned in this process of
                            editing may be expected to cooperate heartily with a view to the
                            preparation of an adequate and honest record.</p>

                <head>Message of the President of the United States to Congress, December 2,
                    1930</head>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="smallcaps">To the Senate and House of
                        Representatives</hi>:</p>
                <p>I have the honor to comply with the requirement of the Constitution that I should
                    lay before the Congress information as to the state of the Union, and recommend
                    consideration of such measures as are necessary and expedient.</p>
                <p>Substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and
                    security; the fundamental strength of the Nation’s economic life is unimpaired;
                    education and scientific discovery have made advances; our country is more alive
                    to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Economic Situation</hi></p>
                <p>During the past 12 months we have suffered with other Nations from economic
                    depression.</p>
                <p>The origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders through
                    a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into speculation rather
                    than constructive enterprise. Had overspeculation in securities been the only
                    force operating, we should have seen recovery many months ago, as these
                    particular dislocations have generally readjusted themselves.</p>
                <p>Other deep-seated causes have been in action, however, chiefly the world-wide
                    overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for such important
                    basic commodities as wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, copper, silver, zinc, to some
                    extent cotton, and other raw materials. The cumulative effects of demoralizing
                    price falls of these important commodities in the process of adjustment of
                    production to world consumption have produced financial crises in many countries
                    and have diminished the buying power of these countries for imported goods to a
                    degree which extended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment
                    in all the industrial nations. The political agitation in Asia; revolutions in
                    South America and political unrest in some European States; the methods of sale
                    by Russia of her increasing agricultural exports to European markets; and our
                    own drought—have all contributed to prolong and deepen the depression.</p>
                <p>In the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the
                    United States, and our recuperation has been retarded by <pb n="VIII"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>the unwarranted degree of fear and
                    apprehension created by these outside forces.</p>
                <p>The extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate
                    percentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the highly

                <p>Various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to
                    20 per cent.</p>
                <p>There are many factors which give encouragement for the future. The fact that we
                    are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and incomes; that
                    our major financial and industrial institutions have come through the storm
                    unimpaired; that price levels of major commodities have remained approximately
                    stable for some time; that a number of industries are showing signs of
                    increasing demand; that the world at large is readjusting itself to the
                    situation; all reflect grounds for confidence. We should remember that these
                    occasions have been met many times before, that they are but temporary, that our
                    country is to-day stronger and richer in resources, in equipment, in skill, than
                    ever in its history. We are in an extraordinary degree self-sustaining, we will
                    overcome world influences and will lead the march of prosperity as we have
                    always done hitherto.</p>
                <p>Economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive
                    pronouncement. Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the
                    economic body—the producers and consumers themselves. Recovery can be expedited
                    and its effects mitigated by cooperative action. That cooperation requires that
                    every individual should sustain faith and courage; that each should maintain his
                    self-reliance; that each and every one should search for method of improving his
                    business or service; that the vast majority whose income is unimpaired should
                    not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreations;
                    that each should seek to assist his neighbors who may be less fortunate; that
                    each industry should assist its own employees; that each community and each
                    State should assume its full responsibilities for organization of employment and
                    relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which built a great
                    Nation.</p>
                <p>Our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree.</p>
                <p>The best contribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary
                    cooperation in the community. The Government, National, <pb n="IX"
                        xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0013"/>State, and local, can join with the community in
                    such programs and do its part. A year ago I, together with other officers of the
                    Government, initiated extensive cooperative measures throughout the country.</p>
                <p>The first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to maintain the
                    standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence against strife.
                    In a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to and we have not
                    witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always heretofore marked
                    depressions. The index of union wage scales shows them to be to-day fully up to
                    the level of any of the previous three years. In consequence the buying power of
                    the country has been much larger than would otherwise have been the case. Of
                    equal importance the Nation has had unusual peace in industry and freedom from
                    the public disorder which has characterized previous depressions.</p>
                <p>The second direction of cooperation has been that our governments, National,
                    State, and local, the industries and business so distribute employment as to
                    give work to the maximum number of employees.</p>
                <p>The third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend
                    construction work and betterments in anticipation of the future. It has been the
                    universal experience in previous depressions that public works and private
                    construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of depression. On
                    this occasion, however, the increased authorization and generous appropriations
                    by the Congress and the action of States and municipalities have resulted in the
                    expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most
                    prosperous years. In addition the cooperation of public utilities, railways, and
                    other large organizations has been generously given in construction and
                    betterment work in anticipation of future need. The Department of Commerce
                    advises me that as a result, the volume of this type of construction work, which
                    amounted to roughly $6,300,000,000 in 1929, instead of decreasing will show a
                    total of about $7,000,000,000 for 1930. There has, of course, been a substantial
                    decrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in advance
                    of need.</p>
                <p>The fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such States and
                    municipalities, as was deemed necessary, of committees to organize local
                    employment, to provide for employment agencies, and to effect relief of
                    distress.</p>
                <p>The result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that actual
                    suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months, and our
                    unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large industrial
                    countries. Some time ago it became evident that unemployment would continue over
                    the winter and would necessarily be added to from seasonal causes and that the
                    savings of workpeople would be more largely depleted. We have as a Nation <pb
                        n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0014"/>a definite duty to see that no deserving
                    person in our country suffers from hunger or cold. I therefore set up a more
                    extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the
                    country. There has been a most gratifying degree of response, from governors,
                    mayors, and other public officials, from welfare organizations, and from
                    employers in concerns both large and small. The local communities through their
                    voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of relieving individual distress and
                    are being generously supported by the public.</p>
                <p>The number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was accurately
                    determined by the census last April as about 2,500,000. The Department of Labor
                    index of employment in the larger trades shows some decrease in employment since
                    that time. The problem from a relief point of view is somewhat less than the
                    published estimates of the number of unemployed would indicate. The intensive
                    community and individual efforts in providing special employment outside the
                    listed industries are not reflected in the statistical indexes and tend to
                    reduce such published figures. Moreover, there is estimated to be a constant
                    figure at all times of nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual
                    income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another. We have an
                    average of about three breadwinners to each two families, so that every person
                    unemployed does not represent a family without income. The view that the relief
                    problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed by the
                    experience of several cities, which shows that the number of families in
                    distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculated
                    unemployed. This is not said to minimize the very real problem which exists but
                    to weigh its actual proportions.</p>
                <p>As a contribution to the situation the Federal Government is engaged upon the
                    greatest program of waterway, harbor, flood control, public building, highway,
                    and airway improvement in all our history. This, together with loans to merchant
                    shipbuilders, improvement of the Navy and in military aviation, and other
                    construction work of the Government will exceed $520,000,000 for this fiscal
                    year. This compares with $253,000,000 in the fiscal year 1928. The construction
                    works already authorized and the continuation of policies in Government aid will
                    require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually.</p>
                <p>I favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to
                    unemployment during this winter. The Congress will, however, have presented to
                    it numbers of projects, some of them under the guise of, rather than the reality
                    of, their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression. There
                    are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions of construction work.
                    The <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0015"/>Government must not undertake works
                    that are not of sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to
                    searching technical investigation, and which have not been given adequate
                    consideration by the Congress. The volume of construction work in the Government
                    is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence as a continuing
                    policy. To increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own
                    purpose, as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry. Again
                    any kind of construction requires, after its authorization, a considerable time
                    before labor can be employed in which to make engineering, architectural, and
                    legal preparations. Our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the
                    next six months, and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or
                    which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted.</p>
                <p>The enlarged rivers and harbors, public building, and highway plans authorized by
                    the Congress last session, however, offer an opportunity for assistance by the
                    temporary acceleration of construction of these programs even faster than
                    originally planned, especially if the technical requirements of the laws which
                    entail great delays could be amended in such fashion as to speed up acquirements
                    of land and the letting of contracts.</p>
                <p>With view, however, to the possible need for acceleration, we, immediately upon
                    receiving those authorities from the Congress five months ago, began the
                    necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality. I have
                    canvassed the departments of the Government as to the maximum amount that can be
                    properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during
                    the next six months, and I feel warranted in asking the Congress for an
                    appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 to provide such further
                    employment in this emergency. In connection therewith we need some authority to
                    make enlarged temporary advances of Federal-highway aid to the States.</p>
                <p>I recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different
                    departments upon recommendation of a committee of the Cabinet and approval by
                    the President. Its application to works already authorized by the Congress
                    assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public welfare. Such
                    action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kinds of over
                    $650,000,000 during the next twelve months.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture</hi></p>
                <p>The world-wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other
                    industries. The average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per cent of
                    the levels of 1928. This average is, however, <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII"
                        facs="0016"/>greatly affected by wheat and cotton, which have participated
                    in world-wide overproduction and have fallen to about 60 per cent of the average
                    price of the year 1928. Excluding these commodities, the prices of all other
                    agricultural products are about 84 per cent of those of 1928. The average
                    wholesale prices of other primary goods, such as nonferrous metals, have fallen
                    to 76 per cent of 1928.</p>
                <p>The price levels of our major agricultural commodities are, in fact, higher than
                    those in other principal producing countries, due to the combined result of the
                    tariff and the operations of the Farm Board. For instance, wheat prices at
                    Minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at Winnipeg, and at Chicago they
                    are about 20 per cent higher than at Buenos Aires. Corn prices at Chicago are
                    over twice as high as at Buenos Aires. Wool prices average more than 80 per cent
                    higher in this country than abroad, and butter is 30 per cent higher in New York
                    City than in Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>Aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world-wide depression we have had
                    the most severe drought. It has affected particularly the States bordering on
                    the Potomac, Ohio, and Lower Mississippi Rivers, with some areas in Montana,
                    Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. It has found its major expression in the shortage
                    of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about
                    2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000 bushels.</p>
                <p>On August 14 I called a conference of the governors of the most acutely affected
                    States, and as a result of its conclusions I appointed a national committee
                    comprising the heads of the important Federal agencies under the chairmanship of
                    the Secretary of Agriculture. The governors in turn have appointed State
                    committees representative of the farmers, bankers, business men, and the Red
                    Cross, and subsidiary committees have been established in most of the acutely
                    affected counties. Railway rates were reduced on feed and livestock in and out
                    of the drought areas, and over 50,000 cars of such products have been
                    transported under these reduced rates. The Red Cross established a preliminary
                    fund of $5,000,000 for distress relief purposes and established agencies for its
                    administration in each county. Of this fund less than $500,000 has been called
                    for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter. The
                    Federal Farm Loan Board has extended its credit facilities, and the Federal Farm
                    Board has given financial assistance to all affected cooperatives.</p>
                <p>In order that the Government may meet its full obligation toward our countrymen
                    in distress through no fault of their own, I recommend that an appropriation
                    should be made to the Department of Agriculture to be loaned for the purpose of
                    seed and feed for animals. <pb n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0017"/>Its
                    application should as hitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any
                    one individual, and secured upon the crop.</p>
                <p>The Red Cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the sympathetic
                    assistance of our people.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Finances of the Government</hi></p>
                <p>I shall submit the detailed financial position of the Government with
                    recommendations in the usual Budget message. I will at this time, however,
                    mention that the Budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the current
                    year were formulated by the Treasury and the Budget Bureau at a time when it was
                    impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have been
                    most seriously affected by it. At that time a surplus of about $123,000,000 was
                    estimated for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affected the fiscal year
                    to the extent of $75,000,000 was authorized by the Congress, thus reducing the
                    estimated surplus to about $48,000,000. Closely revised estimates now made by
                    the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget of the tax, postal, and other receipts
                    for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about $430,000,000 from the
                    estimate of a year ago, of which about $75,000,000 is due to tax reduction,
                    leaving about $355,000,000 due to the depression. Moreover, legislation enacted
                    by Congress subsequent to the submission of the Budget enlarging Federal
                    construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans’ services
                    and other items, have increased expenditures during the current fiscal year by
                    about $225,000,000.</p>
                <p>Thus the decrease of $430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of $225,000,000 in
                    expenditure adversely change the original Budget situation by about
                    $655,000,000. This large sum is offset by the original estimated surplus a year
                    ago of about $123,000,000, by the application of $185,000,000 of interest
                    payments upon the foreign debt to current expenditures, by arrangements of the
                    Farm Board through repayments, etc., in consequence of which they reduced their
                    net cash demands upon the Treasury by $100,000,000 in this period, and by about
                    $67,000,000 economies and deferments brought about in the Government, thus
                    reducing the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimated
                    deficit of about $180,000,000 for the present fiscal year. I shall make
                    suggestions for handling the present-year deficit in the Budget message, but I
                    do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt.</p>
                <p>While it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures
                    during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up
                    construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought, I can not
                    emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV"
                        facs="0018"/>to defer any other plans for increase of Government
                    expenditures. The Budget for 1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of
                    about $4,054,000,000, including postal deficit. The receipts are estimated at
                    about $4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be
                    discontinued, leaving a surplus of only about $30,000,000. Most rigid economy is
                    therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes.</p>

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Legislation</hi></p>
                <p>This is the last session of the Seventy-first Congress. During its previous
                    sittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation, notably:
                    The establishment of the Federal Farm Board; fixing congressional
                    reapportionment; revision of the tariff, including the flexible provisions and a

                    reorganization of the Federal Power Commission; expansion of Federal prisons;
                    reorganization of parole and probation system in Federal prisons; expansion of
                    veterans’ hospitals; establishment of disability allowances to veterans;
                    consolidation of veteran activities; consolidation and strengthening of
                    prohibition enforcement activities in the Department of Justice; organization of

                    reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling, law enforcement in
                    the District of Columbia, and other subjects.</p>
                <p>It is desirable that these measures should be completed.</p>
                <p>The short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs, but there
                    are a number of questions which, if time does not permit action, I recommend
                    should be placed in consideration by the Congress, perhaps through committees
                    cooperating in some instances with the Federal departments, with view to
                    preparation for subsequent action. Among them are the following subjects:</p>
                <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0019"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Electrical Power</hi></p>
                <p>I have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate
                    electrical power. Such regulation should preserve the independence and
                    responsibility of the States.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Railways</hi></p>
                <p>We have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways as a
                    necessity of more stable and more economically operated transportation. Further
                    legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation. In the public
                    interest we should strengthen the railways that they may meet our future
                    needs.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Antitrust Laws</hi></p>
                <p>I recommend that the Congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the
                    economic working of these laws. I do not favor repeal of the Sherman Act. The
                    prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance. Competition is not
                    only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the incentive to progress.
                    However, the interpretation of these laws by the courts, the changes in
                    business, especially in the economic effects upon those enterprises closely
                    related to the use of the natural resources of the country, make such an inquiry
                    advisable. The producers of these materials assert that certain unfortunate
                    results of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resources together with
                    a destructive competition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be
                    remedied because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws. The
                    well-known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration. The
                    people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resources; in
                    the prevention of wasteful practices; in conditions of destructive competion
                    which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner; and they have an equal
                    interest in maintaining adequate competition. I therefore suggest that an
                    inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust
                    laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied
                    without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Capital-Gains Tax</hi></p>
                <p>It is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect of the
                    income tax on so-called capital gains at the present rate is to enhance
                    speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery. I believe this to
                    be the case and I recommend that a study be made of the economic effects of this
                    tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law.</p>
                <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0020"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Immigration</hi></p>
                <p>There is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and more
                    selective basis, flexible to the needs of the country.</p>
                <p>Under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming to the
                    United States seeking work would likely become either a direct or indirect
                    public charge. As a temporary measure the officers issuing visas to immigrants
                    have been, in pursuance of the law, instructed to refuse visas to applicants
                    likely to fall into this class. As a result the visas issued have decreased from
                    an average of about 24,000 per month prior to restrictions to a rate of about
                    7,000 during the last month. These are largely preferred persons under the law.
                    Visas from Mexico are about 250 per month compared to about 4,000 previous to
                    restrictions. The whole subject requires exhaustive reconsideration.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Deportation of Alien Criminals</hi></p>
                <p>I urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid
                    ourselves of criminal aliens. Furthermore, thousands of persons have entered the
                    country in violation of the immigration laws. The very method of their entry
                    indicates their objectionable character, and our law-abiding foreign-born
                    residents suffer in consequence. I recommend that the Congress provide methods
                    of strengthening the Government to correct this abuse.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Post Office</hi></p>
                <p>Due to deferment of Government building over many years, previous administrations
                    had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for secondary facilities in
                    large cities, some of which were objectionable as representing too high a return
                    upon the value of the property. To prevent the occasion for further uneconomic
                    leasing I recommend that the Congress authorize the building by the Government
                    of its own facilities.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Veterans</hi></p>
                <p>The Nation has generously expanded its care for veterans. The consolidation of
                    all veterans’ activities into the Veterans’ Administration has produced
                    substantial administrative economies. The consolidation also brings emphasis to
                    the inequalities in service and allowances. The whole subject is under study by
                    the administrator, and I recommend it should also be examined by the committees
                    of the Congress.</p>
                <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0021"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Social Service</hi></p>
                <p>I urge further consideration by the Congress of the recommendations I made a year
                    ago looking to the development through temporary Federal aid of adequate State
                    and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of
                    communicable disease, particularly in the rural sections. The advance of
                    scientific discovery, methods, and social thought imposes a new vision in these
                    matters. The drain upon the Federal Treasury is comparatively small. The results
                    both economic and moral are of the utmost importance.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi></p>
                <p>It is my belief that after the passing of this depression, when we can examine it
                    in retrospect, we shall need to consider a number of other questions as to what
                    action may be taken by the Government to remove possible governmental influences
                    which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of
                    depression. It is as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measures.</p>
                <p>There are many administrative subjects, such as departmental reorganization,
                    extension of the civil service, readjustment of the postal rates, etc., which at
                    some appropriate time require the attention of the Congress.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Foreign Relations</hi></p>
                <p>Our relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis of
                    cordiality and good will.</p>
                <p>During the past year the London naval pact was completed, approved by the Senate,
                    and ratified by the governments concerned. By this treaty we have abolished
                    competition in the building of warships, have established the basis of parity of
                    the United States with the strongest of foreign powers, and have accomplished a
                    substantial reduction in war vessels.</p>
                <p>During the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world. Asia
                    continues in disturbed condition, and revolutions have taken place in Brazil,
                    Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. Despite the jeopardy to our citizens and their
                    property which naturally arises in such circumstances, we have, with the
                    cooperation of the governments concerned, been able to meet all such instances
                    without friction.</p>
                <p>We have resumed normal relations with the new Governments of Brazil, Argentina,
                    Peru, and Bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able to give
                    protection to our citizens and their property, and that they recognized their
                    international obligations.</p>
                <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0022"/>
                <p>A commission which was supported by the Congress has completed its investigation
                    and reported upon our future policies in respect to Haiti and proved of high
                    value in securing the acceptance of these policies. An election has been held
                    and a new government established. We have replaced our high commissioner by a
                    minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal of our activities with view to
                    complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935.</p>
                <p>A number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or
                    negotiated during the year, and will be presented for approval by the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>I shall, in a special message, lay before the Senate the protocols covering the
                    statutes of the World Court which have been revised to accord with the sense of
                    previous Senate reservations.</p>

                            Yesterday afternoon I had a conversation of about three and one-half
                            hours with Prime Minister MacDonald. Of this time we spent two hours
                            quite alone. The Prime Minister’s son was present for half an hour and
                            Marriner and Craigie<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">R. L. Craigie, head of
                                the American Department of the British Foreign Office.</note> joined
                            us for the last three-quarters of an hour. As a result of the
                            Parliamentary session the Prime Minister appeared tired. He said to me
                            that he had never known any day whether or not before the day’s session
                            was over he might not find himself out of office.</p>
                        <p>He agreed with me that if the heads of the delegations were allowed to
                            constitute a steering committee that would be the best system, but that
                            the fact that Tardieu<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">André Tardieu. President

                            subject somewhat complicated this. Furthermore, it appears likely that
                            should Tardieu be wanted back in France, Briand might be agreed upon as
                            the head of the delegation. The matter has been left in abeyance until
                            other delegations are heard from, although I said I would be quite
                            willing to come alone even if France brought two.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese, the Prime Minister said, had been very stiff in demanding a
                            10–10–7 ratio. Admiral Takarabe<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">Japanese

                            appeared somewhat more conciliatory. I told him that if a treaty which
                            started out with a condition precedent of such a ratio for Japan were
                            submitted to the American Senate, I felt that there was no possibility
                            of its being accepted. I pointed out that Japan would be more reluctant
                            to allow any treaty to be made without them which might make it possible
                            for Great Britain and the United States to build against them fully two
                            to one, and I also mentioned the financial difficulties of building in
                            Japan at the present time. The Prime Minister agreed with me absolutely
                            on the necessity for remaining stiff against this preliminary demand by
                            Japan for 10–10–7. After Marriner and Craigie <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3"
                                facs="0083"/>had joined us, somewhat later, we reverted to the
                            question of possible face-saving clauses for the satisfaction of
                            Japanese public opinion. The question of Japan’s financial necessities
                            was again stressed by us, and we agreed that unless the battleship
                            program were coupled with a simultaneous agreement on auxiliary vessels
                            we would not consent to its alteration.</p>
                        <p>The French, the Prime Minister said, had been acting very badly in the
                            whole matter, but they had become somewhat more conciliatory since his
                            rather stiff answer to their last note. He said that with reference to
                            the proposed Mediterranean Pact<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8">See the French

                            desired was a guarantee, which he could not give of course, nor would he
                            be willing to enter into a treaty which would not embrace all the powers
                            of the Mediterranean, including Yugoslavia and Spain. The Spanish
                            Ambassador had told him, he said, that after the Conference had got
                            under way, Spain could not be brought into it. I told him that if the
                            French were satisfied with a consultative treaty I had a feeling that
                            they might not stand out for an absolute guarantee. Then the Prime
                            Minister told me that in the strictest confidence he would show me a
                            draft which he had made on this subject and which was precisely in the
                            form of the Pacific treaty between the four powers.<note n="9"

                        <p>Tardieu, I pointed out, had won a victory at The Hague, and as he felt
                            reassured respecting the visit to Washington, the other items would be
                            less troublesome. MacDonald also told me that he was prepared to concede
                            the position on trained reserves, and that, in talking to Marriner,
                            Craigie had supplemented this information by saying that this was a
                            concession which they would not wish to make too early in the
                            proceedings and at any rate certainly not before the Conference had
                            opened.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0084"/>
                        <p>His discussion of Italy’s position he opened by saying that Italy was
                            worse than France, and, as I expressed some surprise, he depicted
                            Italy’s economic restlessness and her strong desire for colonies now in
                            the possession of France. In the matter of French and Italian naval
                            building, I told him that I felt, of course, quite disinterested except
                            insofar as it might have reference to the British.</p>
                        <p>Before we began discussing the possibility of making economies in
                            battleships, Craigie and Marriner had joined us.</p>
                        <p>The first economy suggestion was that replacements be postponed.</p>
                        <p>The second was that the units be reduced in size.</p>
                        <p>The third was that the number of units be reduced.</p>
                        <p>MacDonald said that while I was at sea he said almost exactly the same
                            thing in a press statement and that, therefore, my statement of the case
                            was almost telepathic. I had already seen an excerpt from it, I said,
                            which stated that he would consent to a full holiday extending until
                            1936.</p>
                        <p>Then I offered him congratulations on the advances in this position from
                            that which he had adopted while in Washington. He said that both
                            politically and financially he regretted to have to do this but that
                            this was a point on which he felt he must yield, although he was really
                            worried by the industrial aspect of the matter. I have told him that I
                            desired to warn him that probably we would not be able to go along with
                            Great Britain regarding the question of reduction in size of ships,
                            particularly during the period of transition, and that it was our
                            opinion that not much economy would result from it. The question of the
                            reduction we felt should be by numbers; he said that the British
                            Admiralty, in his opinion and Craigie’s, would agree to a reduction in
                            numbers, and he further pointed out that he had been told by the
                            Japanese that if numbers were reduced they would expect an addition to
                            their ratio. It might be dangerous, I pointed out, to reduce the
                            difference in strength existing between battleship fleets and other war
                            vessels, especially with regard to the three main naval powers, and in
                            this matter he said that he felt that there was a practical identity of
                            interests between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was most friendly in its whole tone, and I feel that
                            from the British delegation we will have a full measure of
                            cooperation.</p>

                        <p>8. The following summarizes the situation up to the present.</p>
                        <p>The element of the situation which is most important is that on the
                            voyage over and here the American delegation has developed into a loyal,
                            harmonious unit which is working together as one man. Mac-Donald, on the
                            other hand, has to divide authority with his Dominions who insist upon
                            representation in the meetings of committee chairmen. The Dominion
                            representatives, however, are individually friendly and amenable and the
                            smooth working of the Conference will not, in my opinion, be obstructed
                            by them.</p>
                        <p>At my country house yesterday I had a very friendly and satisfactory
                            conference with the delegation from Italy, and after that Morrow and I
                            had a satisfactory conference with Tardieu and Briand. Tardieu is
                            apparently sincerely desirous of agreement and has definitely abandoned
                            the position that this Conference cannot be final but must be contingent
                            on general disarmament by the League of Nations. Tardieu at the
                            preliminary meeting for organization of the delegation chairmen proved
                            himself to be practical minded and made suggestions in the direction of
                            informality and simplicity in the future working of the Conference. In
                            comparison with the attitude of the French in previous conferences these
                            suggestions were novel.</p>
                        <p>I believe that MacDonald will cooperate with me in respect to the
                            Japanese demands, although I have had no further conference with the
                            Japanese. A favorable outlook for an agreement resulting from the
                            Conference has in general been confirmed by events since my arrival in
                            England, as it is evident that MacDonald will remain in office on his
                            opponents’ sufferance until the Conference has been concluded. One of
                            the most important factors, in my opinion, at present is to convince the
                            British public and the Conservatives that our parity demand is genuine
                            and that we will insist upon it; in case I find it necessary to make
                            some emphatic statement to this effect I hope you will bear this
                            necessity in mind. I also trust that no public statement will be made by
                            the President bearing on the details of negotiations unless I am given
                            opportunity for comment and ample notice as of course any statement that
                            is made by him must be made good while the Prime Minister can, without
                            being taken too seriously here, give utterance to pious hopes and
                            aspirations. This applies among other things to battleship [<hi

                            evening. The French had as their interpreter Paul Mantoux.<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d3fn16">Former head of the Political Department, Secretariat
                                of the League of Nations.</note> The British Prime Minister said he
                            considered it desirable to know what matters were to be discussed at the
                            plenary session today and in the meantime what progress we could make.
                            He was turning over in his mind whether it would not be desirable that
                            the respective delegations hold separate meetings, as for example,
                            between Japan and the United States, between Japan and Great Britain,
                            between Great Britain and the United States, or between France and
                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>France, Tardieu stated, favored both reduction and limitation of armament
                            but felt that further limitation was the pathway to reduction. It was
                            felt by Henderson that disappointment would result if reduction could
                            not be achieved and that a bolder policy of reduction should be aimed
                            for by the Conference at the outset. This was agreed to in not quite
                            such strong terms by MacDonald. It was suggested by Tardieu that if we
                            should use the present programs of the various Governments as a basis,
                            making it clear that the Conference would result in a reduction in the
                            programs as distinguished from reduction of existing navies, this would
                            be a beginning of reduction of armament. The question of ratios and its
                            consequent concomitant of prestige arose later in the evening. It
                            appeared, I said, that because minds were fixed on prestige, programs
                            were apt to be large. It was pointed out by me that possibly this desire
                            might be satisfied in either one of two ways, by raising the ratios or
                            by a change in the nature of the contract. The dangers inherent in the
                            first method were then pointed out by me, that is, that reduction on the
                            one hand would be prevented by it and antagonisms on the other aroused
                            by it.</p>
                        <p>The method which I had discussed with the President was then suggested by
                            me, that is, to avoid all implications of contractual inferiority by
                            merely setting out programs which could not be departed from without a
                            notice say of one year and without giving sufficient reason therefor,
                            thus releasing the other signatories from <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                                facs="0087"/>their corresponding programs. The French seemed to
                            consider this suggestion as helpful and I am informed that Tardieu
                            privately said he considered their difficulties might be solved by my
                            proposed second method. I was informed by Hankey<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d3fn17">Col. Sir Maurice Hankey, secretary of the British
                                delegation.</note> on the following day that he was urging this
                            method upon the Prime Minister as for a long time he had been convinced
                            that it would be the ultimate solution.</p>
                        <p>I conferred yesterday with the Prime Minister concerning agenda of
                            today’s plenary session and informed him that I did not propose to set
                            out a long and detailed argumentation for the maintenance of a large
                            navy and that I hoped that he and the other nations would do likewise as
                            it did not seem wise to me to dig in behind any set statement of needs
                            and the reasons why they should be adopted. This was not agreed to
                            altogether by him as I believe the political effect of some patriotic
                            statement of Britain’s dependence on the sea was valued by him at this
                            time. Mr. Wakatsuki, upon whom I subsequently called, agreed to the
                            limitation of his statement to generalities. This was done by him. The
                            statement of the Italians was likewise based on the point of view that
                            no reduction could be too great and that naval needs were relative. It
                            was still apparently considered politically necessary by the French that
                            a detailed statement be made by them.</p>
                        <p>There was no friction in this morning’s plenary session; the election of
                            Sir Maurice Hankey as Secretary General and a decision that in case of
                            absence of the Prime Minister the chair should be taken by the heads of
                            the other delegations in the English alphabetical order completed the
                            organization of the Conference. The policy suggested in the paragraph
                            above was followed in the speeches. A very long exposé of French coast
                            line area and commerce was read by Tardieu, who frequently stressed the
                            point that these items for France were only exceeded by similar
                            statistics for Great Britain, the United States and Japan. During most
                            of Tardieu’s speech his manner was restrained and almost perfunctory,
                            giving the impression that the effect at home was the essential object
                            of his speech. He stated, however, in the last paragraph that any idea
                            of absolute needs was necessarily modified by relative considerations
                            such as a condition of naval agreement and security. The speech of the
                            Italian delegate was moderate and conciliatory, only stating in
                            principle that equality with the navy of the largest European
                            continental power was the Italian need.</p>

                        <p>18. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. At Mac-Donald’s
                            invitation we had a two hours’ conference on Thursday with the heads of
                            the delegations. The only one of the Dominions represented was
                            Australia, the others having been persuaded by MacDonald to eliminate
                            themselves. Procedure was discussed at length with quite favorable
                            results. Speed in providing methods for sorting out and reporting upon
                            all possible questions before the Conference was particularly urged by
                            MacDonald and Tardieu. An agreement resulted that the heads of
                            delegations should meet every day, beginning Monday, in order that they
                            might discuss the various questions before the Conference and examine
                            how the various questions should preliminarily be disposed of for
                            investigation and report, that is, either by reference to subcommittees
                            of various kinds or by the sessions of the chiefs of delegations
                            themselves. The informal meetings between the separate delegations now
                            in progress will not be interfered with by these meetings. We have
                            received today tentative agenda of subjects to be thus considered and
                            will receive these each day for revision in advance of the following
                            day’s meeting and no subject which is objected to by any chief delegate
                            will be taken up. Conferences have been held today between some of us
                            and the Italians and the Japanese. Yesterday and today we have also been
                            in almost continuous session, as a delegation, making good progress on
                            our own positions as regards various questions.</p>
                        <p>We feel in view of this week’s experience that our delegation is
                            absolutely harmonious and particularly well prepared in advance of any
                            other delegation here. Figure studies which have been of much use to us
                            are apparently lacking even to the British.</p>

                            <item>The only public explanations of the Japanese position with respect
                                to cruisers are based upon formulae representing the strength of
                                opposing sides in the great sea battles of the past, for example,
                                the comparative strengths of the Japanese-Russian fleets in the
                                battle of the Straits of Tsushima, or, of the British and German
                                fleets at the battle of Jutland, and attempt to adduce from the
                                figures the principle that a superior fleet could not be assured of
                                victory unless it had a preponderant relative strength of 10–7, and,
                                conversely, that fleet weaker than its enemy by any proportion less
                                than 7–10 would be certain to meet defeat. It is the opinion of our
                                own Naval Attaché as well as that of other Naval Attachés in Tokyo
                                that this is rubbish.</item>

                            <item>[Paraphrase.] It is undoubtedly only in connection with war with
                                the United States that the 10–7 ratio is considered. The Japanese
                                naval experts believe that the United States in such an event would
                                not permit the development of a war of exhaustion but as soon as
                                possible would seek a final conclusion. This belief is based on the
                                reason that the United States would have to bring over an effective
                                military force; that the use of the best part of the American
                                merchant marine would be required for the transportation of a large
                                army across the Pacific; that the capture of American carrying trade
                                by British and other foreign merchant marines and the loss of the
                                United States foreign marketing would result from the diversion for
                                a long period of time of a large proportion of American merchant
                                vessels. It is consequently believed that as soon as possible the
                                American Navy would try to come to grips with the Japanese
                                Navy.</item>

                            <item>The great distance between Pearl Harbor and Japan, it is believed,
                                would prevent the American battle fleet from effectively carrying on
                                offensive operations against Japan from Pearl Harbor. The American
                                battle fleet, therefore, would immediately upon the outbreak of war
                                proceed to Manila in order that they might operate against Japan
                                from that base which is close enough to permit the freest use of
                                cruisers and submarines as well as of capital ships. The Caroline
                                and Marshall Islands, through which the American battle fleet would
                                have to pass, are mandates of Japan. Excellent places for
                                concealment of submarines are afforded by these islands. For attacks
                                upon the American battle fleet the Japanese would here undoubtedly
                                exploit <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0090"/>the use of the large
                                submarine contingent upon which they insist. The Japanese realize
                                only a portion of the battle fleet could be destroyed by their
                                submarines, but they appear to have confidence in their ability to
                                destroy enough ships to reduce the preponderance of the American
                                battle fleet, thus making it possible for the Japanese fleet to meet
                                the American fleet on terms which would be more or less
                                equal.</item>

                        <p>22. Three and a half hours were wasted in yesterday morning’s meeting of
                            the heads of the five delegations by debate between the French and
                            Italians concerning whether the items proposed by one or the other
                            should precede each other on the informal agenda concerning the disposal
                            of which a consultation was to be held between the heads of delegations.
                            The alphabet, it was finally agreed, should decide this question and the
                            Italian proposition should be preceded by the French proposition so
                            labeled. In the meanwhile progress in the study and consideration of a
                            more detailed plan is being made by the American delegation.</p>
                        <p>The heads of delegations at their meeting this morning determined to hold
                            a plenary session of the Conference at 10 o’clock on Thursday, the 30th,
                            in order that they might discuss the appointment of a committee on which
                            should be represented not more than two delegates from each of the five
                            countries. This committee would report to the Conference and its duty
                            would be to consider the methods of limitation, i. e. (1) global, (2) by
                            categories, and (3) by categories with a transfer possibility.</p>
                        <p>A statement will be made by the Italian delegate to the effect that
                            decisions on any of these methods cannot be accepted by Italy until
                            there is a more exact determination of the question of ratio and tonnage
                            level but that the committee will not be opposed by Italy. The general
                            principle and the parliamentary question involved in the setting up of
                            the committee and its terms of reference as above <pb n="11"
                                xml:id="pg_11" facs="0091"/>described will be discussed in the
                            plenary session. The plenary session’s real object is to prevent the
                            press from getting too restless over the lack of open meetings and to
                            allow time necessary to continue informal discussions between delegates
                            which are now showing real progress and going at full speed.</p>
                        <p>Admission will be granted to a limited number of press representatives
                            and the arrangements for this are now being elaborated between the press
                            officers of the various delegations and the British press office.</p>

                                States.</note> last night spoke to me of the impression which
                            prevails in Japan that the plans of the American Navy are based on the
                            possibility of war with Japan in order to force acceptance of our ideas
                            in regard to China. Japan realized, he said, that a war with the United
                            States would be the worst possible disaster and that therefore Japan
                            even from a selfish point of view could never think of it, but that
                            unfortunately on account of the belief above expressed there was extreme
                            nervousness here.</p>
                        <p>This fear would never be understood in the United States, I said, and I
                            could conceive of no circumstances in which the United States would go
                            to war with Japan over China, that our aims approximated the Japanese as
                            both countries wanted only a China which was substantially and
                            politically sound. I was assured by him that this impression which he
                            said prevailed was not the belief of his Government but that popular
                            opinion had to be taken into account and that popular opinion felt that
                            this possibility of war over some Chinese question was the basis for our
                            opposition to a slightly larger ratio for Japan. Dooman<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d7fn21">Eugene H. Dooman, First Secretary of Embassy in

                            Yoshida who stated that if I could make some authoritative statement
                            contradicting the idea it might be most helpful. I had already planned
                            to say in my speech at the dinner of the America-Japan Society that we
                            have at present no quarrel on the subject of China and that I foresee
                            none in the future but merely closer cooperation in forwarding our <pb
                                n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0092"/>common aim to help China to
                            achieve political and economic stability. There has been, as you know, a
                            radical change in the Japanese policy toward China and it is now clearly
                            recognized that friendly assistance must be the basis for their
                            relations. The above suspicion of our purpose, in my mind, is certainly
                            the principal reason that a higher ratio in large cruisers is insisted
                            upon by the Japanese.</p>

                            work of the Naval Conference and of the continuous conduct of relations

                            the Department feels that utmost care should be taken with regard to
                            both substance and phraseology in any attempt to explain policy of the
                            United States in relations with Japan in terms of American and Japanese
                            policy in relation to China.</p>
                        <p>Careful consideration should be given to the effect not only in Japan but
                            elsewhere of any statement which may be made. For example, it is likely
                            that the statement “closer cooperation in forwarding our common aim to
                            help China to achieve economic and political stability” would be
                            misunderstood in China and would be susceptible to interpretations
                            disadvantageous to us.</p>
                        <p>One might safely say, instead, that it is the desire of this Government,
                            and we are assured and confident that it is also the desire of Japan, to
                            see China achieve economic and political stability. In brief, we believe
                            that it is not necessary to characterize or define our policy or aims
                            with regard to China in terms of Japan’s policy or aims, and that it is
                            desirable to avoid putting the two in the same brackets. The suggestion
                            is offered that you emphasize the point that the China policy of this
                            Government is completely defined in the Washington treaties of 1922,

                            them has any aims regarding China likely to lead to armed conflict with

                            officially at any time or place that the foreign policy of the United
                            States rests on principles which preclude any thought on the part of
                            either the American Government or the people of resorting to war as an
                            instrument of policy.</p>

                        <p>35. [Paraphrase.] For the President. The American delegation, after
                            prolonged consultation with Japanese and British delegations,
                            unanimously favors submitting to Great Britain and Japan the following
                            tentative suggestions which are to be considered not as a collection of
                            separate offers but as a whole. While Admiral Jones approves the balance
                            of the program, he still is convinced that 21 cruisers are essential.
                            The entire plan is cordially endorsed by Admiral Pratt, and all seven
                            American delegates are now united in believing that the 21 cruiser
                            program could be insisted on only with great danger to the Conference’s
                            success.</p>
                        <p>Your criticisms at the earliest possible moment will be appreciated. We
                            have not submitted these written detailed suggestions either to the
                            British or the Japanese, but we are encouraged by their statements in
                            our conferences to believe that a plan along these general lines may be
                            approved by them. The utmost secrecy should be maintained for the
                            present as to the detailed proposal, of which the following will be the
                            substance: [End paraphrase.]</p>

                                    purposes or for use as targets provided these vessels shall be
                                    rendered incapable of further war-like service as prescribed in
                                    the Washington Treaty.</item>

                        <p>2. Tonnages are in Washington standard tons. Three thousand standard tons
                            have been added to each of the <hi rend="italic">Idaho, Mississippi</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">New Mexico</hi> to allow for future
                            modernization.</p>
                        <p>3. Should any provision be made for replacements of battleships, each
                            nation may retain old tonnage if not replaced, and the right of
                            replacement of that tonnage is not lost by such postponement.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to realize now the parity of battleship tonnage which was
                            ultimately contemplated by the Washington Treaty by balancing the <hi
                                rend="italic">Rodney</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nelson</hi>, the
                            United States may lay down one 35,000 ton battleship in 1933, complete
                            it in 1936, and on completion scrap the <hi rend="italic">Wyoming</hi>.
                            If the United States shall exercise this option, then a similar option
                            as to replacing one capital ship shall be granted to Japan.</p>
                        <p>5. “Modernizing” existing ships includes increase in gun elevation.</p>
                        <p>6. The foregoing principles will result in a schedule substantially as

                                <p>Please keep this strictly confidential except for Senator Hale.
                                    All delegates agree that American proposal best possible, and
                                    that insistence on 21 cruisers would make Japanese demands for
                                    8-inch gun vessels so large that Australia and New Zealand would
                                    insist on building such vessels independently of British Navy. I
                                    am thoroughly satisfied with the methods of working out this
                                    proposal with the negotiations incident to it, and of the value
                                    of the proposal to the interest of the United States.</p>
                                <p>For Senator Hale from Reed:</p>
                                <p>Kindly regard this as strictly confidential except for Senator
                                    Swanson.</p>
                                <p>After conversations with British and Japanese our delegation is
                                    unanimous that we have outlined the best proposal that can be
                                    made. Japanese insistence of basing their figures on American
                                    8-inch-gun cruiser tonnage will bring about cruiser building by
                                    Australia and New Zealand, consequently parity could only be
                                    obtained with Great Britain alone and not with British Empire.
                                    You will see that in other directions we would receive many
                                    compensating advantages.”</p>

                        <p>41. Having learned this afternoon that garbled reports of our plan were
                            in the hands of hostile newspapers, in order to place the advantages of
                            the American proposal in the public eye as soon as possible and to
                            prevent all leaks which would concern themselves only with its alleged
                            disadvantages, I have decided, after consultation with the Prime
                            Minister and Mr. Wakatsuki, to issue the attached statement to the press
                            tonight for release for tomorrow (Friday) morning’s papers.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>At the opening of the Conference the United States delegation made no
                                statement of its position or the needs of its country beyond the
                                historical fact of the agreement in principle for parity between
                                Great Britain and the United States. We are now in a position where
                                we can go further. Following discussions among ourselves and
                                negotiations with the British and Japanese which have clarified the
                                limits of possible agreement, our delegation has made suggestions as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>First, with Great Britain immediate parity in every class of ship in
                                the Navy. The gross tonnage of these two fleets is substantially
                                1,200,000 tons apiece. The negotiations last summer between

                                discussions of parity between them to the comparatively
                                insignificant difference in their respective cruiser class tonnage
                                of 24,000 tons. We propose to settle this difference as follows: Of
                                the larger cruisers armed with 8-inch guns, Great Britain will have
                                15 and the United States 18, an advantage to the latter of 30,000
                                tons. In this case our advantage in large cruisers will be
                                compensated to Great Britain by a lesser tonnage on our side in
                                smaller cruisers of 12,000 tons, but under the arrangements stated
                                below this can be equalized at our option.</p>
                            <p>Of the smaller cruisers armed with 6-inch guns, Great Britain will
                                have an initial advantage; but, in order to insure exact equality of
                                tonnage, the United States makes the suggestion that each country
                                will have the option of duplicating exactly the cruiser fleet of the
                                other. Thus Great Britain would have the option, by reducing its
                                number of small cruisers, to increase its large cruisers from 15 to
                                18 so as to give it a total tonnage of 327,000 tons, the exact
                                amount of tonnage which the United States now asks. On the other
                                hand, the United States would have the option, by reducing its large
                                cruisers from 18 to 15, to increase the number of its small cruisers
                                so as to give it a total cruiser tonnage of 339,000 tons, the exact
                                amount of tonnage which the British now ask.</p>
                            <p>In battleships we suggest by reduction in number on both sides to
                                equalize our two fleets in 1931 instead of in 1942. At present the
                                British battleship fleet contains two more vessels than ours. In
                                destroyers and aircraft carriers we suggest equality in tonnage, and
                                in submarines the lowest tonnage possible.</p>
                            <p>As is well known we will gladly agree to a total abolition of
                                submarines if it is possible to obtain the consent of all five
                                powers to such a proposition, and in any event we suggest that the
                                operations of submarines be limited to the same rules of
                                international law as surface craft in operation against merchant
                                ships so that they cannot attack without providing for the safety of
                                the passengers and crew.</p>
                            <p>Second, our suggestion to the Japanese would produce an over-all
                                relation satisfactory to us and, we hope, to them. In conformity
                                with our relations in the past it is not based upon the same ratio
                                in every class of ships.</p>
                            <p>We have not made proposals to the French and Italians whose problems
                                are not so directly related to ours that we feel it appropriate at
                                this time to make suggestions to them. A settlement of the Italian
                                and French problem is essential, of course, to the agreement
                                contemplated.</p>
                            <p>The United States delegates do not feel at liberty to discuss any
                                further details in figures, and it is obvious that the announcement
                                of hypothetical figures by others is calculated only to provoke
                                argument.</p>
                            <p>Our delegation is in agreement on every item of our program and we
                                are in the most hopeful spirit that in cooperation with the other
                                delegations the primary purpose of the Conference, namely, the
                                termination and prevention of competitions in naval armament and
                                such reductions as are found consistent with national security, may
                                be accomplished.</p>
                            <p>This is all that we deem it helpful to state until our suggestions
                                have been considered by the delegations to whom they have been
                                sent.</p>

                        <p>67. Your No. 42, February 7, 10 a.m. No figures have been given out here;
                            and although it is quite clear that your statement had the President’s
                            approval, there has been no specific statement made that he approved it.
                            We do not want to give the impression that you are operating under
                            instructions from here. Your concrete proposal has been sent to Castle.
                            Your statement was widely carried in the press here, but it is too early
                            to appraise reaction. It is favorable, as far as we have it. Swanson was
                            very much pleased, I think, and, while he has made no public statement
                            and says that he is going to withhold judgment, I feel certain that his
                            judgment is favorable. Senator Hale has made no public statement, but he
                            does not like it.</p>
                        <p>My own personal feeling is that the form and matter of your proposal are
                            going to be approved, and that there is not going to be any opposition
                            except that which comes from a small group who would never agree to
                            anything anyway. What makes the most impression is the unanimity of
                            action of your delegation; I think that there will be a very general
                            impression that you have done a good job, and that if you did not ask
                            for more it was for the reason that you are exercising sound judgment on
                            the spot. There is to a rather remarkable degree a willingness to trust
                            the delegation, as far as I can read the press. A note consistently
                            running through the press is the cool, deliberate manner in which the
                            delegation has gone about ascertaining what was wise before they offered
                            proposals.</p>

                            and that they voice positions which we believe to be untenable. Some
                            regret still exists that the totals in the cruiser category are still so
                            high and we hark back to the negotiations which took place by cable
                            before MacDonald’s visit and to the conversations when he was here at
                            which time he hoped to do something further in the direction of cruiser
                            reduction. It is our hope that at some appropriate time and in the
                            delegation’s discretion, you will propose to the British that they
                            consider the old suggestion of police cruisers, at least between you and
                            them. At that time there was in our minds a tentative suggestion that
                            there be substituted a special category of police cruisers of limited
                            speed and armament or alternately of 6-inch gun cruisers over age, but
                            kept in service for police purposes, in lieu of a certain tonnage
                            allocated to the 6-inch gun cruiser category. Of course, you will
                            understand the reasons for this suggestion, how it is made, and that we
                            are not attempting to press an instruction on the delegation.
                            Nevertheless, we cannot abandon the hope that Mac-Donald will be
                            sympathetic toward this proposal. Perhaps it is the sort of suggestion
                            which should be relegated to a later stage in the discussions.</p>

                        <p>84. There was one other matter, in discussing your offer further with the
                            President before his departure for Florida, concerning which you
                            probably understand his wishes; at the risk, however, of repetition we
                            again explain that 200,000 tons for destroyers seems to be a very high
                            figure. Presumably it is now being placed that high by you so that
                            negotiations between Great Britain and France may be left in <pb n="23"
                                xml:id="pg_23" facs="0103"/>a better position; the President hopes,
                            however, that 150,000 tons will be the limit for the final figure.</p>
                        <p>In regard to your offer, the above is the last comment. It appears to us
                            here that your general strategy is correct; only those who will oppose
                            whatever you do are opposed to your plan.</p>

                        <p>60. A conference, in which all pending propositions between the two
                            countries were discussed, was held yesterday afternoon, those present
                            being the Prime Minister, Henderson, Alexander<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d18fn34">Albert Victor Alexander, First Lord of the
                                Admiralty and member of the British delegation.</note> and Craigie
                            for Great Britain, and Adams, Reed, Marriner and myself for the American
                            delegation. It was shown, as a net result of the conference, that an
                            agreement will probably be easy between Great Britain and ourselves,
                            provided France or Japan does not interpose difficulties. With regard to
                            the cruiser proposition, we are standing firm, while it is understood by
                            Great Britain that, unless serious changes should be made in our
                            proposal in other directions which would make it necessary as a
                            counterpoise, the <hi rend="italic">Rodney</hi> option<note n="35"

                        <p>I have, in the private meetings of the chiefs of delegations, sharply,
                            and thus far successfully, prevented any battleship discussion on the
                            ground that, until we are assured that a general agreement in all the
                            auxiliary categories is possible, the United States will discuss no
                            changes in the Washington Treaty. I am, therefore, refusing to discuss
                            battleship questions in the press and trust that, regardless of
                            criticisms either in the press or in the Senate, the same policy will be
                            followed by you in Washington. It is not my desire that I should be
                            forced into a position where a battleship agreement will seem so easy
                            that, even if in the auxiliary categories Japan or France remains
                            obdurate, it will be difficult to avoid pressure for a separate
                            agreement on the subject of battleships.</p>
                        <p>Tardieu’s first figures were received by the Prime Minister yesterday <pb
                                n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0104"/>immediately after the interview
                            with us, and later in the evening he stated that the high levels which
                            they had suggested had somewhat discouraged him. Judging, however, from
                            a private talk with Tardieu, it remains my own feeling that our cruiser
                            figures will be left unchanged by eventual concessions from Tardieu.
                            Japanese counter figures are expected today; we believe, however, that
                            not until after their elections on February 20, will the Japanese come
                            down to earth.</p>

                        <p>36. The situation at the London Conference is difficult to appraise. With
                            regard to Japan, our delegation appears to be standing firm until after
                            the forthcoming Japanese elections; they seem pretty obdurate against
                            any concession to the Japanese point of view. I think it probable that
                            that position contributed to the unanimity in our delegation. We should
                            like to have your comments.</p>

                        <p>I think that certain thoughtful Japanese regret that demand for 10–7
                            ratio in auxiliary ships was made practically a <hi rend="italic">sine
                                qua non</hi> of the Japanese program. They must now face the fact,
                            however, that a large proportion of their people have been taught to
                            look upon this ratio as essential to national safety; that being so,
                            they feel that they cannot surrender. The ratio has become a political
                            doctrine of major importance. The fact that the United States refused to
                            consider this ratio is taken as an indication that we foresee the
                            possibility of war. I have pointed out repeatedly that Japan having
                            accepted the 10–6 ratio in Washington, the belief is general in the
                            United States that Japan’s demands for a higher ratio may equally be
                            taken by the <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0105"/>American people as
                            proof of belligerent intentions on the part of Japan. Baron
                                Shidehara<note n="37" xml:id="d20fn37">Japanese Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> told me this afternoon that the press has just been
                            asking him urgently whether America could possibly think that Japan
                            could attack either the mainland or the Philippine Islands because of
                            this larger ratio. He told them that whatever America might think, an
                            attack was impossible since even if it were immediately successful with
                            regard to the Philippines it would be only the beginning of a war in
                            which Japan would in the long run be completely ruined. I reminded him
                            that it was nevertheless true that the man in the street in America,
                            believing Japan to be already fully protected, would inevitably think
                            some such thing, all the more so as no precise or technical reasons had
                            ever, as far as I knew, been advanced as to why Japan needed this 10–7
                            ratio for defense. Shidehara said that it would be as difficult to give
                            technical reasons as to give convincing technical reasons why the United
                            States must have parity with Great Britain; that all the Navy would say
                            was that Japan might have a sporting chance with this ratio against the
                            United States, whereas with the 10–6 ratio it would have no chance at
                            all. Shidehara added that even with this chance the final result for
                            Japan must be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>It is also said in Tokyo that no attempt is being made in the London
                            Conference to maintain the Washington ratio with France or Italy, that
                            this proves that the Washington Conference ratios were not intended to
                            cover smaller craft, and that the American attempt to hold Japan to them
                            is unfair. That we have no particular interest in France and Italy is
                            admitted, but this very fact is noted to prove England’s greater
                            generosity, in view of her keen interest in European armament.</p>
                        <p>I have tried to give you in my cables the exact Japanese point of view in
                            the belief that knowledge of it may assist our delegates to suggest
                            compromises if any are possible along the lines of least resistance. I
                            was told yesterday by the French Chargé that he believed no compromise
                            possible on submarines either with France or with Japan. My thought that
                            he might be urging the Japanese Government to stand firm on this point
                            was confirmed by Shidehara who said that the Chargé had told him that
                            Japan and France should stand unwaveringly together on this issue as
                            their interests with regard to it were identical. Shidehara told him
                            that Japan would not make agreements of this sort with anyone, as it
                            would not do to divide the Conference into opposing groups; that each
                            nation must stand on its own feet. I am sure he was sincere in this and
                            that Japan will not make any private agreement.</p>

                            14, 7 p.m.<note n="38b" xml:id="d21fn38b">Not printed.</note> At present
                            we are in the center of discussions, and three of us by invitation have
                            been sitting in on the negotiations between France and Great Britain for
                            two days. It is our belief that they intend to agree eventually,
                            although on the cruiser question they are still somewhat apart, have not
                            yet reached submarines, and are making counter declarations as to the
                            impossible positions occupied by each other. Great optimism is felt by
                            Morrow, who is familiar with French methods.</p>
                        <p>We shall meet the Japanese delegation on Monday to make clear our
                            position (1) against any change of the big cruiser ratio, and (2) that,
                            unless a successful treaty covering all auxiliary vessels is negotiated,
                            the Washington battleship treaty should not be modified. We have reason
                            to believe that it is time to communicate these positions directly, even
                            though it has already been done indirectly. An interlude for the above
                            to sink in over the Japanese election day will then probably occur. The
                            Japanese, we feel, have no case for the modification of the Washington
                            ratio in regard to cruisers and no existing construction or program on
                            which to base it, as opposed to the French who have a pretty good case
                            for modification of the Washington ratio. The situation in regard to
                            Japanese submarines is different, and we would desire a compromise which
                            would reduce both sides by 1936. Negotiations, however, are rendered
                            delicate and difficult by the Japanese political situation.</p>
                        <p>The position of Italy is one of sitting silent on the sidelines; and
                            keeping on friendly personal terms with her delegation is all that we
                            are doing. My new form of treaty with a speech in support of it is being
                            held in reserve; if the time comes when it seems that it will bridge a
                            final gap it is to be used.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>It is not believed by any of us that the Conference will fail. Three
                            causes are delaying its progress: first, the inability of MacDonald to
                            delegate and organize his work; second, the enforced absences every week
                            of Tardieu in Paris; and third, the elections in Japan referred <pb
                                n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0107"/>to above. The American delegation
                            is well organized and, whenever it did not seem to cost too much on
                            account of apparent eagerness, has taken the initiative. We are as
                            cordial and united as ever, and more helpful and loyal support has never
                            been given a chairman.</p>

                        <p>121. Your telegram No. 67, February 16, 5 p.m., has been considered. We
                            have no particular suggestions to offer. We do not expect the Japanese
                            position to be changed substantially by the elections on the 20th. If
                            before reaching a final result, and to reach it you decide that
                            concessions are to be made by you in the cruiser class although you do
                            not yourselves believe such concessions to be justified, it seems here
                            to be of importance that the right to build such additional unjustified
                            tonnage should arise only toward the very end of the treaty period for
                            the following reasons: (1) that not until that time will the United
                            States have built up its cruiser category anywhere near to where it
                            should be, and the same is not true with regard to Great Britain or
                            Japan; (2) that right to build additional unjustified tonnage should not
                            arise until after or until time of the conference which will be called
                            toward end of the treaty period; (3) that such right to build shall
                            arise at so late a date that any other nation which feels that it is
                            threatened thereby will very shortly be in a position to be free of the
                            treaty and to build as it chooses; and (4) because if this course is
                            followed it will tend to place a financial burden in certain years which
                            would be likely to be a handicap to actual building.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing are suggestions only.</p>

                        <p>73. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Since the French
                            delegation cannot participate until a new government has been formed,
                            the Conference has been adjourned until February 26. The performance of
                            important informal work will not be interfered with <pb n="28"
                                xml:id="pg_28" facs="0108"/>by this recess. The adjournment was
                            recommended by me to the Prime Minister because I felt that otherwise
                            the Conference would have an appearance of futility; it is also our hope
                            that the return of the French delegation will tend to be hastened by the
                            knowledge of the fact that the adjournment was made necessary by their
                            situation. It is also our hope that the pressure for news on
                            correspondents will be lessened by the fact of adjournment.</p>

                            Conference be made known to us more fully. There is undoubtedly a waning
                            of public interest here. While this may be inevitable and perhaps should
                            not bother us, there is a strong feeling here that nothing is being done
                            to keep down the levels which in every category being considered by the
                            Conference are terribly high. I regret to have to bother you, but more
                            frequent reports are needed.</p>

                        <p>80. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Your No. 131,
                            February 22. Following adjournment I pushed forward informal
                            negotiations with the British which resulted in situation where
                            agreement could be reached at once unless it were upset by the French
                            figures. The only issue remaining is whether the total American cruiser
                            tonnage shall be 320,000 or 327,000. The remainder follows substantially
                            the lines of the offer sent you, with elimination of the new <hi
                                rend="italic">Rodney;</hi> modernization of old battleships is
                            legalized, an arrangement supported by both Jones and Pratt as parity.
                            We have hopes of limiting the Japanese to their present fleet, but we
                            have agreed with the British to delay pressing for final conclusions
                            until after the elections in Japan, as it is believed that a showdown
                            before elections would mean increase in Japanese demands.</p>

                            Government which came immediately afterward caused a wave of pessimism
                            here which is evidently echoed in the press. The French figures were not
                            surprising, however, after the French note of December 20 last,<note
                                n="40" xml:id="d25fn40"><ref target="frus1929v01#pg_299"><hi

                            intimated to me privately that these would be reduced. The serious
                            feature of the situation is the intense popular feeling among the
                            British against the French, which will make it impossible for the Prime
                            Minister to keep his figures down unless the French recede very
                            substantially. In addition to the above, I have had personal talks with
                            Baldwin, Lloyd George, Churchill and Grey.<note n="41" xml:id="d25fn41"
                                >Stanley Baldwin, leader of the Conservative Party; David Lloyd
                                George, leader of the Liberal Party; Winston Churchill, former First
                                Lord of the Admiralty and member of the House of Commons; Earl Grey
                                of Fallodon, former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and
                                member of the House of Lords.</note> They all approve parity with
                            us, but they are disturbed lest MacDonald may not meet the threat from
                            France.</p>
                        <p>Our first problem is, obviously, to get the French to come down from
                            their original figures, which are all we have at present. Then if they
                            will not come down far enough to permit the British to make a
                            satisfactory agreement with us, we shall have to face the second
                            problem: Whether it will be possible to make a three-power agreement
                            with a withdrawal clause to protect the British against the French.</p>
                        <p>There is no change in the pact situation. The British have suggested a
                            consultative pact to the French, who are still holding out for a
                            guarantee. At one time Briand suggested to me that he would like to
                            discuss with me later a supplement to the Kellogg Pact, but I took this
                            to mean something quite separate from the Naval Conference. I have not
                            given anyone encouragement as to our entering a Mediterranean Pact,
                            either consultative or of guarantee. If the President has any new ideas
                            on this subject, I should like to be advised.</p>
                        <p>As far as a waning of public interest is concerned, before I sailed I
                            warned everyone that that was inevitable. This work is a slow,
                            persuasive job, consisting of picking up and binding together the
                            fragments left unfinished from the Washington Conference of 1922. We are
                            doing as well as I expected we should do. Indeed, I think that we can
                            say for this administration that it has clearly accomplished one of our
                            chief purposes, that of healing the serious friction which had arisen
                            between America and Britain over cruisers. Everyone here is agreed on
                            that.</p>
                        <p>MacDonald is staying with me tonight at Stanmore. If there is anything
                            further tomorrow I shall report it.</p>

                            governments were involved, particularly France; (2) because of apparent

                        <p>95. A tentative agreement was reached with the British yesterday, the
                            difference being split at 323,500 tons on total cruiser tonnage. The
                            attempt to limit the size of 6-inch cruisers so far as America is
                            concerned is withdrawn by them, while the <hi rend="italic">Rodney</hi>
                            option is withdrawn by us. The modernization of old ships including gun
                            mountings is, by satisfactory exchange of notes withdrawing protests,
                            legalized by them. Of course the tonnage proposed for destroyers and
                            submarines depends directly on Japan and France, but Great Britain and
                            the United States will try to reduce these tonnages as far as possible
                            below our original offer which was sent to you in our telegram No. 35,
                            February 4. We are encouraged by this settlement as being at least a
                            definite step forward, although of course it may be jeopardized or
                            modified by French or Japanese action. It is highly approved by Reed and
                            unanimously by the whole delegation. With the Japanese active
                            negotiations are taking place.</p>
                        <p>We have received your telegram No. 149, February 26. You will have been
                            reassured as to our attitude on the three-power pact by my telegram No.
                            80, February 23; we still plan, however, to make strenuous efforts to
                            get the French in.</p>

                        <p>154. Apparently with the sympathetic support of Briand, and starting with
                            certain of the American correspondents, a pretty definite drive appears
                            to have developed demanding that the President make a public
                            announcement of policies concerning the Kellogg Pact with a view to
                            satisfying the French of some sort of political security assurance on
                            the part of the United States. This movement has now taken the form of
                            statements from European correspondents to the effect that the President
                            should save the Conference by making some commitment, and that it will
                            be the President’s fault if the Conference fails on account of his not
                            solving, even by so moderate assurances, <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33"
                                facs="0113"/>French security needs. Private advices that such action
                            on his part would satisfy the French are also given the President.</p>
                        <p>Such steady reiteration that the future of the Conference depends on the
                            President’s courage, that he can save the Conference, and that on him
                            rests the responsibility for failure—appears to us to be wholly French
                            propaganda intended in the first place to see if it is possible to
                            secure some American political assurances and in the second place to
                            throw on the President or on the United States responsibility for
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>These developments have been followed up here by considerable agitation
                            from peace groups demanding that the President by such action save the
                            Conference. Of course, the President has ignored all such activities
                            entirely, but we thought that you ought to know what was going on,
                            especially as there may possibly be an opportunity for this activity to
                            be checkmated by you.</p>

                        <p>97. The lawyers representing the several powers have been meeting during
                            the past week with a view to agreeing upon provisions of the treaty to
                            regulate use of submarines in warfare.</p>
                        <p>Proposal has been made by us to adopt text of the first four articles,
                            generally known as the Root resolutions, of treaty regulating use of
                            submarines and noxious gases in warfare which all powers at Washington
                            Conference in 1922 signed and which was subsequently ratified by all
                            with exception of France.<note n="49" xml:id="d32fn49"><ref

                        <p>Being unable to obtain abolition of submarines we desired to obtain the
                            most effective attainable restriction of their use. The best way to
                            accomplish our object seemed to us to propose adoption of the first four
                            articles of the 1922 submarine treaty on account of prestige they have
                            derived from their acceptance by the Washington Conference, and from
                            their ratification by the Senate of the United States and by the
                            constitutional authorities of three of the other four powers.</p>
                        <p>It now seems clear, as a result of the preliminary discussions, that the
                            French will not agree to article III of our proposal making provision
                                <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0114"/>for trial and punishment, as
                            if for an act of piracy, of persons who violate rules set forth in
                            article I; and further that the French will not agree to article IV,
                            which prohibits use of submarines as commerce destroyers as between the
                            parties to the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The following clause has been proposed by the French representatives: “In
                            operations against merchant vessels, submarines are bound to conform to
                            the rules of international law which govern surface war vessels.”</p>
                        <p>Our articles I, II, and IV might be acceptable to Italy, but objection is
                            made to article III, which provides for punishment. The French clause
                            quoted above is preferred by Italy to our article I.</p>
                        <p>Probably Japan would accept the four articles of the 1922 treaty as we
                            have proposed, although the Japanese do not like article III. They may
                            also have some suggestions in the way of verbal alterations.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain is willing to accept all four articles of the 1922
                            submarine treaty, but does not feel that article IV will be a real
                            deterrent. The British think, moreover, that France cannot be induced to
                            accept more than articles I and II.</p>
                        <p>My strong personal feeling is that the French proposal will be much less
                            effective than articles I and II would be, in that the clause proposed
                            would not make clear exactly what the rules of war required and, as a
                            result, in the event of another war, it would not so strongly and
                            promptly crystallize the public opinion of the world against possible
                            submarine abuses. See speech by Mr. Elihu Root in support of articles I
                            and II.<note n="50" xml:id="d32fn50"><hi rend="italic">Conference on the

                                    of submarines as commerce destroyers as between the three powers

                                    apparently be prepared to allow Japan to build one more large
                                    cruiser. It is believed that the United States proposes that
                                    until 1936 she should have 16 such cruisers. It is also
                                    receiving attention [that] the United States has proposed that
                                    with regard to submarines the United States should retain 60,000
                                    tons and Japan about 50,000 tons.”</p>

                        <p>103. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Your telegram
                            No. 154, February 28, 5 p.m. The possibility of making any treaty may
                            ultimately depend upon the question of political security and it may
                            well become pivotal. I am sending this estimate of the situation on to
                            you so that you may be fully prepared in case the necessity for quick
                            decisions occurs. The French, we hear, will return to London next
                            Thursday and the events will then undoubtedly move quickly. This is
                            merely to prepare you for all eventualities and in laying the
                            possibility of last measures before you, I do not mean to paint too dark
                            a picture.</p>
                        <p>The French, at their last meeting before Tardieu left, demanded ten new
                            and two old, 8-inch cruisers. MacDonald was not willing to concede any
                            old ones and only seven new ones, which was one more than the British
                            Admiralty advised. They had not reached the difficulties regarding the
                            submarine program. Thus far no argument has made any impression upon the
                            Italians, who are unyielding in their insistence upon parity with
                            France. If Great Britain would offer them some kind of security in the
                            Mediterranean, they could make concessions, they have privately
                            indicated to us. The public anxiety and feeling against France suddenly
                            aroused here by her demands is the serious factor in the situation and I
                            am of the opinion that if France persists in her program MacDonald may
                            find himself eventually unable to carry through even a three-power
                            treaty on the basis of our present tentative agreement with a clause
                            similar to article 21 of the Washington Treaty. MacDonald has stated
                            that if necessary he is in favor of such a three-power treaty but it is
                            possible, I believe, that in the last event public opinion may compel
                            him either to demand a much higher building program than that <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0117"/>now agreed upon between us or to remain
                            entirely free. The following is the situation as to security proposals:
                            The British originally declined to give a guaranty pact for the
                            Mediterranean. Informally the British suggested a consultative
                            Mediterranean Pact, but the French were of the opinion that it added
                            nothing to the Covenant of the League of Nations. An alternative form of
                            agreement along the lines of the Locarno Covenant<note n="54"
                                xml:id="d35fn54">Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, signed at Locarno on
                                October 16, 1925, by Great Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, and
                                Italy; League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >liv</hi>, p. 289.</note> has been informally submitted by the
                            French, and this alternative form of agreement is still under discussion
                            between France and Great Britain. I have informed both Great Britain and
                            France that, whether consultative or guaranty, America would not join in
                            such a pact.</p>
                        <p>Briand has suggested on two occasions that eventually he would wish to
                            discuss with me an amendment to the Kellogg Pact, a matter which had
                            been broached last summer in conversations between Claudel and me.<note

                            whole matter over with him after these naval negotiations have ended. It
                            is my surmise, though Briand has said nothing, that they will propose
                            something in the nature of a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for
                            reductions in naval armament in the shape of an amendment to the Kellogg
                            Pact. These are reasons why France might readily believe such a
                            proposition on her part reasonable: (1) Because the need of additional
                            machinery in the pact was brought up by me last summer, although what I
                            had in mind was an investigative rather than a consultative clause; and
                            (2) because the same suggestion for a consultative clause such as Briand
                            now has in mind was made by Chief Justice Hughes last April.<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d35fn55">Speech delivered by Charles Evans Hughes, President
                                of the American Society of International Law, at the twenty-third
                                annual meeting of the Society, Washington, April 24,
                            1929.</note></p>
                        <p>As you know, it is suggested by your cable that the proposal is being
                            urged by the French indirectly through the press and otherwise. Our
                            information is that the Locarno proposal is still under discussion and
                            this proposal is much more according to France’s wish. The danger to the
                            naval treaty in the Senate, should any political agreement be presented
                            as a condition, is recognized.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to me, however, that the Kellogg Pact suggestion is
                            inherently objectionable and if France should bring it forward its
                            presentation to the Senate would almost necessarily have to be at a
                            different time and as a different matter from the naval treaty, since
                            much time for its negotiation with the other signatories would be
                            required. I think, therefore, it should be given most careful
                            consideration <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0118"/>before rejection,
                            should the point be reached where it offered the only solution to a
                            complete failure of the Conference. The relations of the French with us
                            make it easily possible to bring forward any such proposition directly
                            and they should not be forced to use propaganda, and I am quite in
                            harmony with the President’s refusal to give attention to attempts made
                            indirectly to get from him a pronouncement on the subject.</p>
                        <p>If the question of security arises when the French return, I plan, first,
                            to encourage the making by the Mediterranean powers of a satisfactory
                            pact among themselves; and, second, to urge the consultative features of
                            article 21 of the Washington Treaty upon the French. These would
                            probably have to be introduced into any new treaty in order to assure
                            them of consultation with America as to naval problems which may in the
                            future arise. The British will not consent to a three-power treaty if
                            none of these steps are sufficient to save the treaty from failure. May
                            I have the President’s views as to how far a Conference resolution
                            calling upon all the signatories of the Kellogg Pact for a consultative
                            amendment to that pact can be supported by us? I append, in order that a
                            full background of the matter may be before the President, a draft of
                            the proposed treaty drawn up by us but which has been withheld awaiting
                            a favorable opportunity to bring it forth at a time when final
                            differences may be bridged by it. It has been shown to both MacDonald
                            and Tardieu, but they have not been given copies. They are inclined to
                            favor it. The consultative feature of article III has already been
                            approved by the Senate, having been copied exactly from article 21 of
                            the Washington Treaty. Here follows the present draft:<note n="56"

                        <p>167. [From the President.] Of course we are most anxious over the
                            situation of the Conference. Due to French propaganda, the support of
                            the American public is rapidly dividing. We could not hope to have the
                            support of the war groups and we are rapidly losing support of the peace
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me that some vigorous leadership by the American group is
                            needed. Unless France is prepared to take a real cooperative part we
                            must prepare the way for three-power action, for it appears here that
                            she has no intention of cooperating; and we must prepare for her
                            isolation and assessment with responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Would you not consider making a definite proposal to the Conference, as a
                            start, that parity should exist among all naval powers on destroyers and
                            submarines, the latter at a maximum of 40,000 tons with an appropriate
                            reduction, say 100,000 tons in destroyer fleets, both of these to be
                            brought about prior to 1936 by obsolescence.</p>
                        <p>The following are the reasons: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Theory that the weaker naval powers do not need a large number
                                    of submarines unless they wish them for offensive purposes,
                                    because the submarine is the coast defense weapon for these
                                    weaker powers.</item>

                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The American and British theory that we would be better off if
                                    submarines were abolished surely leads to the logic that we are
                                    proceeding to our objective if we can hold down the number of
                                    them.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Accomplishment of tonnage reduction is of great importance
                                    economically.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>It is important morally and the Conference would be saved from
                                    the present prospect of increasing world tonnage by attempts to
                                    limit instead of decreasing tonnage.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Parity should flatter Japan, France, and Italy. The
                                    responsibility will be placed squarely upon the shoulders of
                                    France for undermining the Conference should she oppose it.
                                    Japan and Italy should not oppose full parity and France would
                                    be isolated. It would restore confidence in this country back to
                                    the plane of our initial high purposes if such a position of the
                                    American delegation is made known and it would not seem
                                    necessary to await the return of the French delegation. The
                                    President submits the above.</item>

                        <p>168. [From the President.] Referring to the Department’s telegram No.
                            154, February 28, 5 p.m., it is asserted here repeatedly and with
                            assurance that you are personally in favor of expanding the Kellogg Pact
                            by a Presidential declaration.</p>
                        <p>With regard to this question it is also asserted that the delegation is
                            divided, and that Senator Robinson disapproves.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe either of these reports, but the agitation is assuming
                            dangerous proportions, as witness the petition sent you this morning by
                            the Foreign Policy Association. Such agitation will undoubtedly result
                            in placing upon our shoulders the blame for the failure in relation to
                            France.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning our assumption was that the Kellogg Peace Treaty
                            marked a new era in international relations and that the provisions of
                            this treaty warranted a reduction in strength by the naval powers of the
                            world. Upon this thesis the whole Conference was launched and not upon
                            the theory that before such a reduction could take place it would be
                            necessary to have further political agreements. The Kellogg Pact would
                            be repudiated if the Conference were launched on any other basis.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0121"/>
                        <p>We are of the opinion that the American public in the end will resent
                            French cooperation at the expense of expanding the Kellogg Pact and we
                            are not disposed to expand it as the price of French cooperation. The
                            objectives of such extension will be interpreted by our public as
                            involving us directly in the politics of France for the purpose of
                            giving them guarantees. The entanglement of political guarantees in
                            these negotiations, though they may be indirect, is more dangerous than
                            anything else to the whole American acceptance of results. We could
                            expect only the most embarrassing and dangerous consequences if we were
                            to make a declaration of what we believe to be the logical procedure
                            under the Kellogg Pact in case of international controversy, under the
                            present situation. If it were made at any other time than in connection
                            with this Conference it might have no dangerous results.</p>
                        <p>The French, for instance, are bound to use it as a tangible justification
                            for some action and this would in turn be proof to the people of this
                            country of a dangerous involvement on our part with the Republic of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>If any such political appendix is entered into by the Conference, Senator
                            Robinson is being accepted by the Democratic Party to lead the
                            opposition. Such a point of opposition would also be welcome to certain
                            independent Republicans. I am of the opinion that even if the President
                            were to make any coincidental declaration that could be interpreted as
                            such a policy there would not be the remotest possibility of ratifying a
                            naval agreement. Such a declaration independent of any naval agreement
                            which might be entered into might have the effect of an acceptance of
                            the naval agreement by the Senate, but it would certainly result in a
                            reservation or a resolution denying the authority or binding character
                            of any such declaration in order to humiliate the President or to serve
                            political purposes. In order that you might fully understand our next
                            telegram, the President has sent you the foregoing.</p>

                        <p>171. Your telegram No. 103, March 3.</p>

                            <item>Your position that the United States should join in no
                                Mediterranean Pact but would not object to an agreement of this sort
                                among other powers, is in accordance with our views.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In principle, we accept articles 3 and 4 of the form of treaty <pb
                                    n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0122"/>proposed by you, and we agree
                                that they follow article 21 of the Washington Treaty fairly closely.
                                We are confident, however, that it would be an improvement if you
                                could amend the concluding phrase of your article 3 to read “meet in
                                conference with a view to agreement on alteration of the programs of
                                naval armament.” We also suggest omitting the words “the amendment
                                of the provisions” in the first sentence of your article 4, and
                                substituting “alteration of programs” in their place. It is our
                                purpose by these changes to emphasize that the Conference is not to
                                be on political matters or to cover joint naval action, but merely
                                to deal with programs of construction or scrapping armament. We
                                want, in other words, such a clause to be definitely different from
                                the one in the Four-Power Pacific Treaty, thus making it impossible
                                to misunderstand the clause as one under which there might creep
                                into being a new Holy Alliance of the Allied and Associated naval
                                powers.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>With regard to amending the Kellogg Pact, it is our feeling that
                                it is due to the pact that the state of the world has been so far
                                changed as to permit this Conference to bring about a reduction in
                                arms now. The United States feels proud of its share in initiating
                                the pact with France and does not desire to be mixed up in efforts
                                to amend it which may not be understood by some of its signatories
                                and which may seem to go too far to some of them. We would,
                                nevertheless, if France so desires, agree to take up and explore,
                                entirely separately from the naval treaty, the possibility of a
                                general agreement by all nations to initiate investigation of
                                controversies which have not otherwise been settled, thus making
                                public opinion more effective. On the other hand, we cannot agree to
                                consult as to other coercive sanctions or to consult only with the
                                allied naval powers. An agreement of this sort would be so diluted
                                and attenuated as to be of no real value to the French even for
                                temporary political purposes unless there were an exaggeration of
                                its meaning. It cannot, moreover, be doubted that opponents of naval
                                reduction would exaggerate it as an excuse for belaboring the
                                results of the London Conference if the naval treaty included any
                                agreement for consultation or conference.</item>

                                News.</hi></note> press reports and those of other correspondents
                            close to Briand indicate that an all-round 25 percent cut in programs is
                            likely to be proposed by the French. Such proposals are obviously put
                            forward solely with a view to causing embarrassment and reinforcing in
                            our mind the desirability of your taking some such action as indicated
                            in our telegram of yesterday, No. 167.</p>
                        <p>We are not, as we see it, particularly interested in the size of the
                            French fleet inherently, except in so far as it reflects on us through
                                <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0123"/>boosting the British fleet,
                            but it does seem to us that the Conference has reached a stage where our
                            delegation is bound to be embarrassed by the French taking the offensive
                            and raising serious disturbances in the United States, as they have
                            already in various directions begun to do.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us from this distance improbable that there is any indication
                            on the part of France of actually building a 725,000 ton fleet and that
                            the British would be amply safe up to 1936 in proceeding with a program
                            like the one we have outlined possibly even with such reduction in
                            destroyers and submarines, and that a general provision that the British
                            shall be free to take such steps as will give them protection in the
                            event that the combined fleets of any two other powers, excepting the
                            United States and Japan, shall exceed or threaten to exceed the British
                            fleet.</p>
                        <p>Less even than France is Italy likely to build such a fleet and Britain
                            would certainly be amply protected until 1936 under such an arrangement.
                            It is not necessary to formulate in those terms the two-power
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>The time has come, we strongly feel, for the American delegation to take
                            the offensive against the French proposals by demanding a reduction in
                            certain categories such as submarines and destroyers before the American
                            public shall have become completely prejudiced against us through the
                            French. The support of the American public would tend to be restored
                            through any indicated demand on our part for limiting the tonnages now
                            under discussion.</p>

                                <p>In the effort to devise suggestions to get around the deadlock, I
                                    have held frequent and informal meetings with Matsudaira. It has
                                    been suggested, but the suggestion has not yet been approved by
                                    either delegation, that the construction of our eighteen
                                    8-inch-gun ships should be so planned that the last three should
                                    be laid down in the years 1933, 1934, and 1935, respectively. By
                                    this procedure Japan would be assured that we shall not have
                                    actually in service more than fifteen ships to her twelve when
                                    the next Conference will convene. We have worked out this
                                    schedule in connection with the general naval study of the
                                    possibilities of completing the construction called for under
                                    the proposals now being discussed between the Japanese, the
                                    British and our delegation. This suggestion is not inconsistent
                                    with the Japanese position and appears to preserve the American
                                    position. There seems to be no substantial dispute in regard to
                                    cruisers carrying 6-inch guns, as the Japanese demands are not
                                    in excess of what we are prepared to allow. They ask 105,000
                                    tons in destroyers as against 150,000 tons for the British and
                                    Americans. Ninety thousand for Japan is our maximum. In view of
                                    the great preponderance in destroyers which we now have this
                                    appears fair.</p>
                                <p>The British apparently acquiesce in the suggestion concerning
                                    submarines which has been made to the effect that Britain and
                                    America should scrap down to 60,000 while all submarines
                                    becoming 13 years old between now and 1936 should be scrapped by
                                    Japan, thus giving the Japanese on that date 52,000 tons. The
                                    Japanese appear willing to accept the proposal on capital ships
                                    which was outlined in our original proposition for immediate
                                    scrapping and a construction holiday, it being understood that
                                    no new battleships to match the <hi rend="italic">Rodney</hi>
                                    would be built by America or Japan. The fact that unless an
                                    agreement is reached on auxiliaries there can be no battleship
                                    holiday has been impressed upon them. Unless we can get a
                                    comprehensive treaty now, the Washington schedule must be
                                    adhered to as our delegation and the Washington administration
                                    will not yield at this point nor do I believe the British will
                                    do so. This fact should be strongly impressed on the Tokyo
                                    authorities.</p>
                                <p>A minimum of new construction outlay by Japan and the least
                                    possible scrapping of ships, which she now has, are called for
                                    by the suggestions now under consideration. Japan would be given
                                    by these suggestions in the two classes, which are its principal
                                    concern, 72 percent in 8-inch cruisers and 87 percent in
                                    submarines in actual commissioned tonnage at the time of the
                                    1935 Conference. Naturally, however, at the completion of
                                    construction then under way if no change were made in the 1935
                                    Conference Japan would be at approximately 60 percent in
                                    8-inch-gun tonnage. If the Japanese insist on a flat 70 percent
                                    it can lead only to a disruption of the Conference and will
                                    necessarily arouse alarm in America and the demand that the
                                    treaty forbidding fortification of Manila be terminated. Our
                                    argument to the Japanese here is that our generous offer to
                                    scrap capital ships and half our destroyer fleet clearly shows
                                    our pacific intentions. It developed last night in conversation
                                    with the British that they are willing to go as far as, but no
                                    further than, the suggestions which have been made, especially
                                    with regard to the <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0125"
                                    />building of two additional 8-inch cruisers of 8,800 tons each
                                    by the Japanese. This proposal would clearly be cause for great
                                    alarm to Australia and New Zealand. It has been our effort to
                                    impress upon the Japanese that a large part of our cruiser,
                                    destroyer, and submarine fleet must remain in the Atlantic and
                                    at Hawaii and Panama. The Japanese would be given a clear
                                    supremacy over us in the Western Pacific by the suggestions we
                                    are now discussing. It is realized, I believe, by Ambassador
                                    Matsudaira that we have gone as far as it is possible to go in
                                    these suggestions and that even for this it will be difficult to
                                    get the unanimous approval of our delegation. Possibly Japan’s
                                    naval officials think they can secure better terms by holding
                                    out, but you will be absolutely correct in assuring Tokyo
                                    officials that this is not the case, should the question be
                                    broached.</p>

                        <p>108. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Your telegrams
                            No. 167, March 3, 7 p.m., and No. 168, March 3, 8 p.m. Some of your

                            167 that you are willing to have parity in destroyers and submarines.
                            Provided it can be done without precipitating a break with France, which
                            we are still hopeful of avoiding, I agree with you that the present
                            situation needs a new expression of the high purposes with which you
                            initiated this movement toward naval limitation. Ambassador Edge,<note

                            To reach any agreement, however, they regard some political pact as an

                                xml:id="pg_46" facs="0126"/>heads of delegations together. Tardieu
                            cannot be absent from home continuously, for the position of the new
                            French Government is not secure enough to permit it. He will be here for
                            the coming week end and possibly subsequent week ends.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that MacDonald is Chairman and host of the Conference
                            I believe he is entitled to be consulted before a step is taken which
                            may vitally affect its outcome, therefore your proposition could hardly
                            be put forward publicly by us without full previous conference with him
                            for we already have different tentative agreement. Furthermore, we are
                            not in the position to be sure that a three-power agreement is possible,
                            although I have for 10 days been pressing him on the subject.</p>
                        <p>We think the Japanese attitude as to cruisers less defensible than that
                            of the French; they have been adhering very stubbornly to position which
                            we cannot accept. I think you will see, for all these reasons, that
                            before your suggestion can be carried out it will require time and
                            opportunity. I have not had an opportunity to confer with the delegation
                            today for I have a cold and am confined to my house at Stanmore. I
                            shall, however, confer with them and also Mac-Donald as soon as
                            possible. I am glad to have your suggestions.</p>

                        <p>111. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Answering
                            further your cables No. 167, and No. 171 to American delegation on March
                            3, 7 p.m., and March 4, 7 p.m., respectively. Both telegrams were
                            carefully considered this morning by the delegation.</p>
                        <p>1. Your attitude regarding any proposal to amend the Kellogg Pact is
                            clearly understood by us; it coincides entirely with our view. I have
                            had a personal talk with MacDonald, since the arrival of your telegram;
                            have explained to him our position on this matter; and have received his
                            cordial agreement. We need not fear, therefore, that the British will
                            add any pressure in support of such a proposal by France.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to your submarine and destroyer-reduction proposal,
                            contained in your telegram No. 167, the delegation is of the opinion
                            that your suggestion with regard to an offer of parity at a very low
                            figure in submarines may offer a valuable opportunity to improve our
                            tactical situation. The whole delegation feels, however, that it cannot
                            be done, without endangering the success of the Conference, before the
                            French return to London. We will use it later after the Conference is
                            under way and I have already begun to take such steps for its use.</p>
                        <p>I cannot explain at length at present but the delegation also felt that
                            there were differences in the situation of the destroyer fleet which
                            militated against taking a precisely similar situation as to
                            destroyers.</p>
                        <p>3. MacDonald assured me today that he would go forward with the other
                            powers in case the French would not join in an agreement. MacDonald is
                            very anxious to make a four-power agreement, if possible, which would
                            include Italy. We feel certain that Japan would not dare to remain out
                            but in case they all prove obdurate he is willing to make a two-power
                            agreement with us.</p>
                        <p>4. I am giving out tonight the following press statement in an attempt to
                            relieve somewhat the pressure which is being brought upon you by peace
                            supporters who are ignorant of the true situation:<note n="66"

                        <p>181. I had a talk with Swanson and Borah, separately, today and I gave
                            them a fair picture of my idea of the present situation of the
                            Conference without showing them any of your cables. They both <pb n="49"
                                xml:id="pg_49" facs="0129"/>talked freely, although I told them I
                            was not trying to commit them as to their views. Senator Borah stated
                            that the best agreement would be with the five powers but a three-power
                            agreement would be good. He also stated that a five-power agreement with
                            any kind of a political pact would not be as good as a three-power
                            agreement without a political pact. Borah stated that it is not so much
                            the political pacts that he objects to but that the tonnage demands of
                            France are impossible and France is behaving like a spoiled child.
                            However, he is of the opinion that international trouble would more
                            likely be created by a political pact than by giving Japan a couple of
                            additional cruisers and France a great many more cruisers and
                            submarines. Since he does not think they will build he does not care how
                            many they have the right to build. Owing to the present conditions of
                            the fleets and also the present trade conditions he cannot bring himself
                            to fear Japan as an immediate potential enemy.</p>
                        <p>Swanson on the other hand dislikes political pacts and he fears the
                            Senate’s reactions and reservations on them. He would not consider a
                            three-power agreement as bad. He does not like Japan and consequently
                            does not want to give them much. On the whole, rather than political
                            assurances and agreements, he would prefer to make concessions to France
                            and Japan in cruisers.</p>

                                >Transmitted to the American delegation as Department’s telegram No.
                                184, March 7, 11 a.m.</note> I am grateful for your message, which
                            was clear and interesting. I have been told by Shidehara that, with
                            regard to your conversations, he had just received a personal message
                            from Matsudaira. The figures were exactly those sent by you. This seemed
                            extremely generous, I said, and if accepted by the delegations it surely
                            was a basis for agreement. The several points were discussed and I made
                            it very plain that the suggested revision of the capital ship program
                            depended absolutely upon agreement on auxiliaries. He said, in regard to
                            large cruisers, that since we were definitely allowed eighteen such an
                            arrangement was a denial of the 10–7 ratio demanded by Japan. I told him
                            that it seemed to leave the question open for the next Conference, and
                            the fact that the requested ratio was more than maintained could be <pb
                                n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0130"/>established in public opinion
                            prior to that time by the Japanese Government. If our last three
                            cruisers could be postponed until 1935, he said that agreement would be
                            simple, that then another cruiser might also be asked for by Japan. My
                            answer was that Great Britain would certainly have something to say in
                            this regard and that American public opinion was of equal importance
                            with Japanese; that if these demands which seemed excessive were
                            insisted upon by Japan very bad feeling in America would certainly be
                            caused, something far more to be feared than an extra cruiser or two;
                            also that he was mistaken in saying that eighteen cruisers was what we
                            wanted, for actually our minimum had been twenty-one, and furthermore in
                            reducing to eighteen we had made a great sacrifice, and that the only
                            compromise could not certainly be limited to ourselves. Shidehara is, I
                            believe, personally willing to accept American suggestions in regard to
                            the cruiser question but fears the opposition of the Navy. The telegram
                            has been shown to no Navy men by him.</p>
                        <p>The submarine question Shidehara considered the most difficult and asked
                            the reason for our great opposition to submarines. Our belief, I said,
                            was that submarines were bound to be used in the way they had been used
                            by the Germans. Denying that Japan would ever so use them, he stated
                            that they were wanted by the Japanese Navy only for coast defense, that
                            ratio was not a matter of concern inasmuch as Japan could never be
                            attacked by American submarines, but that a certain number for coast
                            defense was estimated as necessary. Japan, he said, not only would be
                            ready to sign the Washington submarine treaty but, since France would
                            not agree that submarines could not even be used for visit and search of
                            merchant vessels, would gladly sign a new treaty with the United States
                            alone. The London arrangement, I pointed out, involved more than Japan
                            and the United States, and France would be encouraged in its demands by
                            the large submarine tonnage for Japan. We were not discussing ratio, I
                            pointed out, but only whether Japanese submarines should be scrapped
                            down to 52,000 tons when they reached 13 years of age. The United States
                            was offering to scrap at once a large part of its submarine fleet.</p>
                        <p>He heartily concurred when I told him that it would be a tragedy if the
                            Conference should be disrupted by Japanese insistence on 70 percent.
                            There was a clear understanding that our talk was as informal as yours
                            and Matsudaira’s. The suggestion made as to the submarine treaty was the
                            only new one. Any discussion of fortifications was avoided because
                            anything in the nature of a threat is not only ineffective but dangerous
                            when dealing with the Japanese … <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0131"
                            />In addition, looking at it from the broader aspect, nothing would be
                            more certainly disastrous to peace in the Pacific regions than the
                            construction of further fortifications. Only as a last resort could this
                            be justified.</p>

                                3rd<note n="72" xml:id="d46fn72">Not printed; see telegram No. 97,
                                February 28, 7 p.m., from the chairman of the American delegation,
                                    <ref target="#pg_33">p. 33</ref>.</note> enclosing the
                            paraphrase of a cable despatch from Secretary Stimson saying that he
                            would like my views upon three questions regarding the Washington treaty
                            in relation to the use of submarines concluded February 6, 1922.</p>
                        <p>The first question is whether the first and second Articles of the
                            Washington submarine treaty constitute a more desirable form of
                            statement than the clause now proposed by the French in London, as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“In operation against merchant vessels
                                    submarines are bound to conform to the rules of international
                                    law which govern surface war vessels.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">My answer is a clear affirmative. The proposed French
                            alternative is not merely a weaker statement but it is an abandonment of
                            the chief and avowed purpose of the Washington provisions. That purpose
                            is stated in Article Two of the Washington treaty in these words: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“so that there may be a clear public
                                    understanding throughout the world of the standards of conduct
                                    by which the public opinion of the world is to pass judgment
                                    upon future belligerents.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The rules of international law are known only to experts, who can always
                            dispute about them indefinitely. Upon such a basis no clear public
                            understanding can be reached and therefore no public condemnation can
                            follow. If the French are unwilling to agree to the first two Articles,
                            it would be infinitely better to have no treaty at all than to make a
                            treaty in the form they propose, which would virtually be a retirement
                            on the part of the United States, Great Britain, Italy and Japan from
                            the statement of the rule and the effect of the rule contained in the
                            treaty of Washington. About the only thing we could be sure of then
                            would be that the statement of rules and the effect of them in the
                            Treaty of Washington is not correct because all <pb n="52"
                                xml:id="pg_52" facs="0132"/>the nations which joined in making that
                            statement have given it up.</p>
                        <p>As to Articles Three and Four the situation is entirely different. They
                            propose new provisions not yet forming a part of international law, and
                            their omission from the new treaty would merely indicate that general
                            acceptance of those provisions had not been reached, which is, of
                            course, true. I think, however, that if a new treaty were made on the
                            subject there should be a clause which prevented the new treaty from
                            impairing in any way the obligations of Articles Three and Four between
                            the powers which have entered into them.</p>
                        <p>I should think that the French would understand that a refusal to agree
                            to Article Four of the Treaty of Washington was notice to the world that
                            she intends to use submarines as commerce destroyers and that her
                            refusal to agree to Article One is notice to the world that she intends
                            to be as free as possible from any application of the rules of
                            international law in the use of submarines as commerce destroyers.</p>
                        <p>To be more specific, I do not think the inclusion of Article Three is
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>I do not think it desirable to include Article Four in a treaty to be
                            signed by only three powers. The provision limited to three powers would
                            necessarily be futile and it would rather tend to confuse the
                            application of Article One.</p>
                        <p>If there is anything more I can do or say let me know and I shall be glad
                            to do what I can.</p>
                        <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                        <p>121. Your telegrams No. 177, March 5,<note n="72a" xml:id="d47fn72a">Not
                                printed.</note> and No. 178, of March 5. We are making progress in
                            our negotiations with Japan. We are close together and I believe that
                            better results than in your telegram No. 178, March 5, can be had. Time,
                            however, is necessary for such negotiations and no hurry is possible.
                            There has been a basic change in the situation covered by your No. 178.
                            Both the British Admiralty and Japan object to the 10,000-ton
                            proposition and it is, therefore, not available. In addition serious
                            aircraft carrier reduction is opposed by our entire delegation as well
                            as Admiral Pratt, who has been most liberal on other matters; first,
                            because the tonnage allotment of the Washington Treaty is probably low
                            in proportion even to our proposed reduced fleet on account of the <pb
                                n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0133"/>development in aircraft in the
                            last 10 years in which the American Navy has played a leading part; and
                            second, because in the <hi rend="italic">Lexington</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Saratoga</hi> there is frozen a disproportionate
                            amount of this tonnage and, since the expense of scrapping them would
                            never be faced by Congress, there is practically no value in the
                            theoretical suggestion of reserving a right to replace them. For a long
                            time the matter has been carefully considered and we believe that to
                            make a serious reduction without proportionate compensation would
                            cripple the fleet in the feature in which it is most advanced. A slight
                            reduction of 10,000 or 15,000 tons purely for moral purposes may
                            eventually become possible but there is doubt even of that.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the Kellogg Pact amendment was broached to me by Briand but my
                            reply was that I considered such a suggestion wholly separate from the
                            question of security in the Naval Conference and the subject was at once
                            dropped by him.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by the British Government that they have practically
                            abandoned the thought of giving any guarantee.</p>

                            yesterday with Wakatsuki and today with Matsudaira. The matter of the
                            application of 20,000 tons is now the narrow margin of difference. All
                            possible concessions have been made by us. We have offered to allow the
                            Japanese to retain 20,000 tons of cruisers over 20 years of age but
                            without the right to replacement in order that we may give apparent
                            compliance with the Japanese popular insistence on 70 percent. Spreading
                            this 20,000 tons over various categories of modern ships is asked by the
                            Japanese. This would be fought bitterly by our Navy people, as well as
                            by the British Admiralty and Dominions, and I know that it <pb n="54"
                                xml:id="pg_54" facs="0134"/>will not be acceptable to our
                            delegation. The actual effective strength of the Japanese will always be
                            in excess of 70 percent during the life of the treaty on account of the
                            proposed spread of our building program over the 6-year period of
                            contemplated treaty. It is hoped that this point will be conceded by the
                            Japanese, for agreement seems impossible without this concession.</p>

                            has just reached me.<note n="74" xml:id="d49fn74">Not printed; see
                                telegram No. 97, February 28, 7 p.m., from the chairman of the
                                American delegation, <ref target="#pg_33">p. 33</ref>.</note> I left
                            New York on February 28th and have been traveling.</p>
                        <p>I have not read the Washington Submarine treaty since February 1923, and
                            no copy of it is now at hand; but, speaking from memory, it is my
                            impression that the proposed French substitute for Articles 1 and 2 may
                            be taken to imply what those articles prescribe in detail. I therefore
                            assume that France would not hold out against those articles, although
                            she might desire some changes in specifications or in phraseology.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 I have never myself been able to regard as sound or as
                            practicable. The word “piracy” has been and still is popularly and
                            promiscuously used as an epithet to render odious things done on land as
                            well as on the sea. Take, for instance, the phrase “literary piracy.”
                            But, to assume to classify and to punish as piracy acts done by
                            individuals under public authority is contrary to the elementary legal
                            conception of the pirate as a person who cruises and commits acts [not]
                            authorized by a recognized government. The article, in my opinion, is
                            also incapable of just and effective execution, and, if its enforcement
                            were attempted, would inevitably lead to reprisals.</p>
                        <p>The retention of the submarine as a commerce destroyer seems logically to
                            exclude article 4. The distinctive advantage claimed for the submarine,
                            as a fighting machine, is, I believe, that it is the most effective
                            means of discharging torpedoes, especially at battleships. If there has
                            been any proposal to abolish the use of torpedoes for offensive
                            purposes, I have overlooked it.</p>

                        <p>126. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. I took Morrow
                            with me on Saturday morning and had a conference with Henderson.
                            Henderson and Briand, I had learned, were about to meet and I wished
                            Henderson to know clearly the American position in opposition to the
                            consultative pact. A definite and clear statement of this was made to
                            him. This precaution was a fortunate one, as it developed that he felt
                            quite differently from MacDonald and such a pact had even been drafted
                            by him.</p>
                        <p>That afternoon I had tea at Stanmore with Briand and Léger, with Morrow
                            present, and had a long talk with them. I then told them that I had
                            reached the conclusion that any blending of a successful naval treaty
                            and the Kellogg Pact now would be disastrous to both; that I was a
                            friend of both. I gave them a full and careful explanation of my
                            position on the modification of the Kellogg Pact, filling in fully the
                            background since last summer when the subject was first broached; and my
                            reasons for the conclusion which I had reached. I told him why the
                            papers in America relied on by him did not represent real public opinion
                            on the subject and explained fully to him the situation as to that
                            public opinion. The interview, which was long and friendly, terminated
                            in his telling me that the matter was ended so far as he was concerned
                            and that he fully understood my position.</p>
                        <p>Briand and Massigli had a long conference at Chequers on Sunday with
                            Henderson and the Prime Minister, as I was told by the Prime Minister
                            today. He had overruled Henderson, so he told me, on the subject of a
                            consultative pact. The interview with Briand, he said, had been long and
                            friendly, and any idea which Briand had had of a guarantee of military
                            assistance was ended. The Prime Minister hoped that through some other
                            formula an agreement with the French could still be worked out. He is
                            thinking of inserting a preamble in the proposed naval treaty which
                            would recite and reaffirm the Kellogg Pact as to the renunciation of
                            war. The following sentence from the joint statement made at

                        <p>Negotiations between the French and the British were resumed today, with
                            Morrow, Robinson and myself present. This session later merged into a
                            session of a subcommittee, which lasted all day and will continue
                            tomorrow, for the purpose of analyzing the British-French figures.
                            Morrow was present.</p>
                        <p>Morrow and I believe that a purely consultative pact would not help in
                            reducing France’s figures, unless the French people would falsely
                            conceive such a pact to imply that we would give military assistance
                            against an aggressor, and it seems to us that what France really wants
                            is a security pact of mutual military assistance against an aggressor.
                            We are convinced, in other words, that American newspapers such as the
                                <hi rend="italic">Baltimore Sun</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >World</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, which
                            have been attacking the President for not favoring a purely consultative
                            pact, are wrong in their belief that France would be satisfied with such
                            a pact.</p>
                        <p>Reed, aided by me, has been carrying on negotiations with the Japanese
                            contemporaneously with the foregoing negotiations. The negotiations with
                            the Japanese are very tedious, as the Japanese, evidently in an endeavor
                            to satisfy internal dissensions in their delegation, are bringing to us
                            recurrent propositions which they know we will refuse; however, we
                            believe we are slowly reaching a point of agreement with them which will
                            be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Italians remain noncooperative.</p>
                        <p>The reference to the Rapidan joint statement which the Prime Minister
                            made last night in his broadcast was suggested to him by me in order
                            that pressure on the President might be relieved by giving evidence that
                            the Prime Minister did not expect America to cooperate in affairs in
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>198. Just had a consultation regarding your telegram No. 126, March 10.
                            There is no comment. The course which you are pursuing is all right; we
                            do not well see how you could take any other.</p>
                        <p>If the information leaked out that what France wanted is a security pact
                            of mutual military action against an aggressor and that a purely
                            consultative pact would not help in reducing her figures, it might be
                            helpful to public opinion here. It is impossible, of course, <pb n="57"
                                xml:id="pg_57" facs="0137"/>to do that here. The reporters who are
                            supposed to represent the views of Briand give just the opposite
                            impression in American papers. However, you will have to decide whether
                            to follow this suggestion. You will understand that it is only a
                            suggestion.</p>

                        <p>199. Your telegram No. 97, February 28, 7 p.m.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the substance of Mr. Root’s letter of March 7, printed on
                                <ref target="#pg_51">page 51</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>We have not yet heard from Mr. Moore. My feeling is that articles III and
                            IV, to which Mr. Root refers, are of even less importance than he views
                            them. To me, article III always seemed and still seems definitely
                            unwise. I cannot imagine that a naval officer in command of a submarine
                            would be affected by it in the least and I certainly do not believe in
                            post-war trials. I should not think that it would be necessary to insert
                            the clause he suggests preventing a new treaty from impairing in any way
                            the obligations under articles III and IV of the powers which have
                            entered into them. I agree with Mr. Root that inclusion of article IV in
                            a three-power treaty is not desirable, and I do not regard it as
                            essential in a five-power treaty.</p>
                        <p>With regard to articles I and II, I agree with Mr. Root that they are far
                            better than the proposed French clause, but I would not agree that these
                            articles could not be changed or modified in expression to meet the
                            wishes of any of the powers; but because of its vagueness, the
                            particular French expression seems to me very objectionable.</p>

                        <p>128. Your No. 198, March 11, 4 p.m. I had already had a conference with
                            the press yesterday afternoon at which time I explained our position to
                            them as to political pacts. I pointed out that America is already a
                            party to many pacts which make consultations obligatory and that our
                            objection to a consultative pact was not because of <pb n="58"
                                xml:id="pg_58" facs="0138"/>its nature; that it was because the
                            French would naturally feel, under the circumstances in which the
                            proposed pact is presented, that it is an equivalent for their abandoned
                            naval strength and they may claim reimbursement in kind in an emergency.
                            All our best American reporters were present and they expressed
                            themselves as understanding our position and as much gratified at having
                            it explained to them.</p>
                        <p>MacDonald will not resign, though he lost an important vote in the House
                            of Commons last night. His position has caused us some apprehension for
                            some time for fear of a possible slip-up. It is quite possible that the
                            Conservative leaders, though they are anxious to permit him to finish
                            the Conference, might, by accident, lose control of their own
                            followers.</p>
                        <p>I have come to the conclusion that both for the reason of the possible
                            eventuality just mentioned and as a tactical maneuver against the delays
                            which we are suffering from Japanese and French sources, we should
                            proceed, therefore, with the drafting of a two-power treaty with Great
                            Britain. I discussed the matter with MacDonald this morning, and he
                            agreed with me. He also told me that he had specific information that
                            the delays we have encountered during the past week with the Japanese
                            were instigated by the French. Consequently, I had a conference with
                            Wakatsuki this morning; after some further futile negotiations over
                            figures, I told him that the adverse vote in the House of Commons last
                            night had troubled me greatly, and that I was proceeding to close up
                            with MacDonald. Although my statement was made under the usual pledge of
                            secrecy, what I said will probably leak out and I advise you of it so
                            that you may be prepared to back us up at home.</p>
                        <p>The proposed two-power treaty might cover all categories but carry a
                            provision that the sections which relate to reductions under the
                            Washington Treaty would not become effective unless and until a treaty
                            with Japan is made by both Great Britain and the United States to cover
                            all categories of fleets. An immediate treaty for a battleship
                            equivalent or reduction between the British and ourselves would be just
                            what the Japanese would most like, of course, as it would permit them to
                            economize on battleship replacements and yet leave them free to proceed
                            with their auxiliary construction.</p>

                            with Morrow sitting in. Alexander has been patient in handling the
                            situation and has spoken very plainly to the French, but the latter are
                            unyielding. Last evening he made them the offer <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0139"/>of 66,000 tons in submarines, that

                            construction. Dumesnil stated in reply that such figures were not even
                            inside the zone of possible negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Tardieu is coming to London for the week end.</p>

                        <p>207. Your telegram No. 128, March 12, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>(1) In regard to situation which has developed at the Conference, we
                            agree, of course, that a two-power pact is better than nothing, but that
                            a three-power pact would be very much stronger in all its implications.
                            A serious question arises as to whether at the right moment, no doubt
                            later on, we would not make some intermediate concession to the Japanese
                            to bring them into the pact.</p>
                        <p>(2) We should also like to have your view as to whether the moment has
                            not arrived when the President should issue a public notice in the
                            nature both of an appeal and a definition of the American position. The
                            reasons for the disavowal of a political pact under the setting staged
                            by the French have appeared in the press here, but it would be desirable
                            to have them formally and extensively rammed home to the American
                            public. The pronouncement might be in the nature of an appeal for
                            reduction and limitation, stating that these negotiations were
                            undertaken in consequence of the Kellogg Pact, which is already a
                            security pact of the first order; also a strong statement might be added
                            on necessities of the world in the matter of naval arms. Then possibly a
                            statement might be included to the effect that upon some entirely
                            separate occasion when there could be no connection with question of
                            French naval armament, the Government of the United States would be
                            prepared to take part, as occasions arise, in investigatory processes,
                            which would be for the general purpose of establishing public opinion
                            but for no purpose of sanctions.</p>
                        <p>If it is your belief that such a statement as sketched would be
                            advantageous, it is highly desirable that you formulate broad lines of
                            it and send it to us.</p>
                        <p>(3) We assume that you still expect to draft a five-power treaty on
                            humanization of use of submarines; in that regard, it does not seem to
                            us to be important whether or not departure from the form of the
                            Washington Treaty be made, nor do we believe that articles III and IV of
                            that treaty are of real importance.</p>

                        <p>The following is the present situation: We have stood firm against
                            allotting more than 108,400 tons of 8-inch-gun cruisers to Japan but our
                            offer has been to defer until 1933, 1934, and 1935, respectively, the
                            laying down of our last three cruisers. The offer of the Japanese has
                            been to limit their 8-inch-gun cruisers to twelve in number, but they
                            requested the privilege before 1936 of replacing the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Furutaka</hi> class with 10,000-ton ships. Reed was told by
                            Matsudaira that this had been suggested by you in Tokyo and in
                            Washington. Reed’s reply was that there must have been a
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>We have stood fast at the present Japanese tonnage of 98,415 tons of
                            6-inch cruisers except when we agreed, in a talk between Stimson and
                            Wakatsuki on Wednesday, to ascertain what view regarding a possible
                            increase of Japanese 6-inch cruisers to 108,000 tons would be held by
                            our Navy. Having discovered the bitter opposition of the Navy and the
                            majority of our delegates to this increase, we are informing the
                            Japanese delegates of its impossibilities today.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese appear satisfied with 97,500 tons of destroyers and the
                            allotment of this much is agreeable to us.</p>
                        <p>Reed has held out in talks with Matsudaira for 60,000 tons of American
                            submarines against 52,700 tons of Japanese, but yesterday in the
                            Stimson-Wakatsuki talk it was intimated that parity at 52,700 might be
                            acceptable. The Japanese would be satisfied with this we believe.</p>
                        <p>Particularly with regard to the French is the Conference situation at
                            this moment critical. If Japan cannot agree with us within a few days,
                            MacDonald has agreed with Stimson that we will prepare a two-power
                            treaty establishing parity with Great Britain and America in auxiliary
                            categories of fleets by which competitive building in them would be
                            ended. The battleship program of the Washington Treaty will not be
                            modified by this treaty since we will not do that unless by a treaty
                            covering all categories in which Japan joins. You can readily see how
                            favorable, in view of French difficulties, will be the public reaction
                            in America and Great Britain if a three-power treaty covering all
                            categories including battleships can be joined by Japan. An unfortunate
                            effect correspondingly would <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0141"/>be
                            caused by a Japanese refusal to join. It is essential to have an early
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>That we have gone to the limit to accommodate Japan should be impressed
                            upon Shidehara. The increase in speed limit of exempt vessels from 18 to
                            20 knots has been reluctantly agreed to by us. Maximum submarine
                            displacement has been raised from 1,800 to 2,000 tons. Japan has been
                            conceded the right to build two 5,000-ton minelayers in the special
                            class, and we have agreed to allow her to retain in the special class
                            for use as training ships five old cruisers of 43,690 tons. Parity in
                            submarines and particularly 70 percent in 6-inch-gun cruisers has been
                            agreed to by us. An agreement is impossible on the 70 percent ratio
                            8-inch-gun cruisers, as it would not be acceptable to Great Britain and
                            our Senate. We can go no further.</p>

                            108,400; 6-inch, 100,450; destroyers, 105,500; submarines, 52,700. This
                            will mean 60 percent in 8-inch, 70 in 6-inch, 70 in destroyers, and
                            submarine parity. We have agreed to make the same recommendation to the
                            British as well as to our delegation and to Washington. A reservation
                            will be inserted by Japan to the effect that after the expiration of the
                            treaty she may claim that 10,000-ton cruisers will replace the <hi

                        <p>136. For the President and the Acting Secretary of State. Your No. 207,
                            March 13, 2 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. Probably as result of my statement to Wakatsuki on Wednesday relative
                            to a two-power pact, negotiations with the Japanese moved forward
                            yesterday and culminated in an agreement supported by all our delegation
                            and by the majority of Japanese delegation (see our telegram No. 134,
                            last night). Settlement was submitted by us last evening to the British
                            and approved by them. Wakatsuki and Matsudaira have agreed to use their
                            earnest efforts to have it approved at Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>In view of the difficulties of negotiation we think this settlement very
                            satisfactory. Admiral Pratt highly approves. By it the Japanese are held
                            down to their existing construction of eight cruisers; they are allowed
                            only about 2,000 tons additional 6-inch cruiser construction; their
                            existing destroyer fleet is reduced by 17,000 tons and their submarine
                            fleet is reduced to amount which it will reach in 1936 by obsolescence
                            without any additional construction.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>2. Alexander, Henderson, and Dumesnil on Wednesday afternoon reported to
                            full committee on the negotiations as to the fleet figures of the
                            British and the French. The committee was composed of the foregoing,
                            with the addition of MacDonald for the British and Briand and Massigli
                            for the French. Robinson, Morrow, and I sat in. Nothing came from the
                            meeting but discouraging counter statements. The French adhered to their
                            high figures and Dumesnil made unyielding statements of the absolute
                            needs of the French. A tense atmosphere pervaded the meeting, and I said
                            nothing as I <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0143"/>was afraid that the
                            French might feel that our opposition amounted to a virtual combination
                            with Britain. In all Conference circles on that evening there was great
                            pessimism and Briand issued a pessimistic statement which indicated the
                            impossibility of obtaining a substantial five-power treaty.</p>
                        <p>Morrow and I called on Briand and Dumesnil yesterday morning, at which
                            time I stated as forcibly as possible our views on the impression which
                            would be made on the American public by their figures. In an endeavor to
                            maintain the friendly relations which we have had with the French and at
                            the same time to impress them with the serious effect which would be
                            produced upon relations with America by their attitude, I had made this
                            statement the most carefully thought out one that I had yet made. At
                            once Briand abandoned the assertions of absolute needs made by Dumesnil
                            and limited himself to arguments which had as their basis relativity
                            with Italy and the latter’s stubborn position. Briand showed a much more
                            hopeful attitude at the close of the conference and it found us joined
                            in an effort to find means of accord with Italy.</p>
                        <p>3. Grandi,<note n="80" xml:id="d58fn80">Dino Grandi, Italian Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, and head of the Italian delegation.</note> in the
                            meantime, had been worked upon by MacDonald, who reported to me that
                            afternoon that Grandi had made some slight concessions toward giving
                            figures for examination. At the close of the day a much more hopeful
                            attitude prevailed than at the close of the previous day. There is much
                            dependent on Tardieu’s visit tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>During the conference Briand admitted that he had not expected me to
                            yield to his suggestion of America’s joining a consultative pact, but
                            that he had made the application because he had been directed to do so.
                            The possibility of securing a five-power pact which will be successful
                            depends upon two things: (1) our ability to induce Italy to make some
                            statement as to her needs; and (2) the possibility which still exists
                            that Britain may give France some material assurance which would induce
                            France to reduce her figures.</p>
                        <p>4. I think that a statement from the President along general lines
                            suggested in our No. 128, March 12, 6 p.m., would possibly help. The
                            delicate and critical situation may change with Tardieu’s arrival. Will
                            send suggestions as to what we think would be most likely to help
                            situation here, after consultation with delegates, if it should be
                            desired to make the statement.</p>

                        <p>140. (1) A five-hour conference took place at Chequers yesterday between
                            the French and British delegations. The true results of the situation
                            are difficult to appraise, but Dawes and Morrow, both of whom have known
                            Tardieu in past negotiations, share my impression that he hopes
                            eventually to make a five-power agreement.</p>
                        <p>Tardieu is very stubborn in regard to his figures and is making great
                            efforts to persuade both the British and us to help him to bring Italy
                            down to a sufficient margin of naval inferiority. Whether he is doing
                            this for domestic politics only or whether it masks some international
                            order between the two nations, I am not yet able to determine. As our
                            work progresses, the situation may be clarified. The French have stated
                            the amount of tonnage superiority they demand over the Italians, and by
                            taking old tonnage into consideration it is not impossible that such a
                            tonnage superiority may be worked out from the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi>. Aside from this, however, Italy is trying to force France
                            to concede formal naval parity, while <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0145"/>France is trying to force Italy to concede formal naval
                            inferiority. Neither can hope to win this issue, yet neither one will
                            yield.</p>
                        <p>MacDonald and I are trying to suggest some formula of mutual reservations
                            and agreement upon a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> which is not
                            to represent real maritime interests. I believe that if any solution is
                            reached, it will be along some such line as this. I am assuming in all
                            of this, however, that there is no secret military issue involved, and
                            as to that I am not yet sure.</p>
                        <p>(2) In further answer to your No. 207, March 13, 2 p.m., I have consulted
                            the delegation and we are clearly of the opinion that the situation
                            would not be helped on this side by any Presidential statement. We are
                            strongly opposed to any appeal, either here or at home, for reduction.
                            Assuming that Japan ratifies the Japanese agreement, we shall have
                            accomplished a three-power settlement which should receive, we believe,
                            the hearty approval of the President and of the American public. When it
                            was submitted to the President in February (our telegram No. 35,
                            February 4), its adoption received his hearty approval. For him now to
                            appeal for reduction would give, almost inevitably, the impression that
                            he is in sympathy with the recent criticism of the pacifist press, which
                            has of necessity been ignorant of the details of the settlement and of
                            the difficulties against which we have labored. A result of that sort
                            would be most unfair to the delegation.</p>
                        <p>As far as a statement regarding the consultative pact is concerned, my
                            decision has been expressly accepted by both Briand and Tardieu, and
                            accordingly there is no reason for such a statement here. The matter is
                            no longer an issue in the Conference. The press summaries received from
                            you seem to indicate that my statement has been accepted fairly well by
                            the American press, even papers like the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                            and the <hi rend="italic">World</hi>, their former attitude being taken
                            into consideration; but if the President wishes to ram home the subject
                            still further, I perceive no great objection, from this end of the line,
                            to doing so, except for the danger which always exists in stirring up a
                            dead issue. It is our general impression that it would be better to
                            withhold all Presidential statements until our negotiations are
                            concluded, when a statement from him will undoubtedly be very helpful in
                            bringing home the character of such a settlement as we may accomplish
                            and the reasons for it.</p>

                            been repeated to London. The statement gives fairly accurately the
                            figures of the tentative agreement but it interprets them most unfairly
                            and would appear to be intended to make difficult Japanese official
                            consent. The final paragraph reads as follows:<note n="83"

                                <p>“The latest American proposal constitutes a concession in
                                    appearance but in contents it still adheres to its own

                                    for some ulterior purpose, reports are being circulated to the
                                    effect that the United States has recognized Japan’s demand.
                                    This gives the people of Japan exceedingly erroneous
                                    information. The Japanese Navy by no means accepts such a
                                    proposal.”</p>

                        <p>The Vice Minister of the Foreign Office, Yoshida, said that Shidehara
                            immediately telephoned the Vice Minister of the Navy, who, it is stated,
                            knows nothing of the statement and will issue a denial that it was of an
                            official nature. The Vice Minister believes that some person in the “big
                            navy” group gave out the statement. The papers are absolutely incorrect
                            in alleging that the Premier passed on the statement. As the denials
                            never have the effect of the original statement, the Foreign Office is
                            very angry, for this makes its task more difficult. I told him that it
                            utterly discouraged me when I saw it because it looked like a failure in
                            London by which relations for years would be embittered. Without an
                            agreement in London, I reminded Yoshida, the cruiser law presumably
                            would be carried out as it stood. They knew this, he said, and Baron
                            Shidehara was preparing a strong statement to be presented at the Friday
                            meeting of the Cabinet. The necessity for prompt and favorable decision
                            was again urged by me since the limit of concession has been reached by
                            the United States. Anything further, I reminded him, would probably not
                            in any case be acceptable to Great Britain since the question is by no
                            means solely between the United States and Japan. Then he desired to
                            know whether I believed England would sign a three-power treaty with the
                            figures which the delegations have agreed to recommend to their
                            Governments, if France persisted in the stand which it has taken. He was
                            informed that I naturally <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0147"/>could
                            not interpret British views but that it appeared probable to me that
                            Great Britain would accept either of them if a political clause calling
                            for further discussion in case the French construction program became
                            menacing, were added. I do not believe that the situation here is as bad
                            as has been made out by the papers.</p>

                        <p>145. In an effort to bring matters to a head, we are holding conferences
                            constantly. However, there are no further definite results that I can
                            report at this time. I learned on Monday through Japanese delegation
                            representative that the French were endeavoring to get the Japanese to
                            raise their figures regarding submarines. Castle in Tokyo confirmed this
                            later. This effort was reported to us by a representative of the
                            Japanese delegation and we together with the British are taking steps to
                            accelerate this tentative agreement by the Japanese Government at Tokyo.
                            We are still hopeful that the Japanese Government will ratify our
                            tentative agreement without any substantial alterations but our
                            informant here thinks that there is a real controversy between Japanese
                            civil government and the naval party there.</p>
                        <p>As to whether the French are merely protecting their position to maintain
                            their present high tonnage figures or whether they are making an effort
                            to break up the Conference, there is a difference of opinion here. We
                            are doing our utmost to combine patience with energy in bringing the
                            situation to a focus. We are inclined toward the former hypothesis but
                            we are not neglecting to prepare ourselves against the latter.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Root’s purpose of clearly defining for the benefit of public opinion
                            the rules of international law preventing inhumane practices against
                            merchant vessels are fully met, in the opinion of Malkin and my own
                            adviser, Rublee, in the foregoing. Both Malkin and Rublee believe it an
                            improvement in its definition of “a place of safety”. In their opinion
                            French criticism of Root’s article for combining rules of visit and
                            search with rules for protecting life is to a certain degree well
                            founded and they feel that in that respect this proposal is
                            superior.</p>
                        <p>The fact that it comes from the British who are chiefly interested in
                            limiting submarine attack against commerce and the fact that it may
                            satisfy the French who are actively opposing the Root form makes it
                            worthy of careful consideration but I am not committed to this, however.
                            Does Root see any serious objection to this substitute? I should like to
                            know.</p>

                                <p>“Admiral Kanji Kato, chief of the Naval Staff, and Vice Minister
                                    Admiral Kobayashi called on the Prime Minister yesterday
                                    afternoon. There was a full exchange of opinion, Admiral Kato
                                    going into the American proposal at great length and explaining
                                    the effect which it would have upon the disposition of Japanese
                                    naval forces. He pointed out that while there was virtual
                                    agreement over the demand for the global ratio in auxiliary
                                    vessels, the inferior ratio of 60 <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"

                                    Japan to construct new submarines before 1936 made it impossible
                                    for Japan to accept the proposal. He then went on to say that as
                                    Japan had gone so far as to surrender parity and accept the 70
                                    percent ratio, which is the minimum compatible with national
                                    security, as the basis of the agreement it now remained for the
                                    United States to make the next concession. After the Prime
                                    Minister had put several questions regarding the future of the
                                    Conference, Admiral Kato brought out his last and final plan. He
                                    proposed that the Government should explore the possibility of
                                    establishing a political treaty to cover the Pacific and to
                                    include Japanese-American relations with respect to China. Mr.
                                    Hamaguchi promised to give the suggestion the most careful
                                    consideration.”</p>

                        <p>53. Last two sentences of your telegram No. 51, March 20, 11 a.m. We hope
                            that the Japanese Government will not formulate any proposal along this
                            line. The Department is of the opinion, in view of existing treaties
                            already in force, that no useful purpose is likely to be served by a
                            further political treaty with Japan relating to the Pacific.
                            Furthermore, the Department considers, in view of the history of
                            Anglo-Japanese Alliance and Lansing-Ishii notes, that it would be
                            gratuitously offensive to China and a possible source of embarrassment
                            to have relations with China determined or defined by a treaty between
                            Japan and the United States in which China would not be included. If the
                            matter is broached to you in any connection, you should not give any
                            encouragement to this idea unless otherwise instructed by the Secretary
                            of State.</p>

                        <p>53. Yesterday Shidehara assured me that he was exploring every
                            possibility to bring about acceptance by Japan; he stated that he was in
                            communication daily with Hamaguchi and the Navy but that he was not
                            optimistic. He promised to bring the contents of your telegram, which I
                            gave him in writing, to Hamaguchi’s attention immediately. He evidently
                            was opposed to my approaching the Prime Minister directly; if I saw
                            Hamaguchi personally, sensational articles might do great damage for the
                            press is watching every move.</p>
                        <p>It is Shidehara’s understanding that on replacement of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Furutaka</hi> class it was agreed that at the next conference Japan
                            should have the right to demand replacement by one 10,000-ton cruiser
                            when our 16th had been built, another when our 17th had been built, and
                            another when our 18th had been built. He stated he was not sure that the
                            United States reserved the right to oppose but that England had reserved
                            this right. I told him that we reserved the right to oppose; that the
                            original idea had been that Japan would claim right to replace <hi
                                rend="italic">Furutaka</hi> class by large cruisers in 1943 but I
                            would consult you as to whether the situation had changed any. He was of
                            the opinion that only the British opposed the idea at present. I told
                            him that the United States, I felt, was firm for the 10–6 ratio in
                            8-inch cruisers because these were associated, in some way, with capital
                            ships, and that because Japan agreed to this ratio the United States had
                            agreed not to fortify its Pacific possessions. Failure to reach
                            agreement, I impressed upon him, could only lead to a full resumption of
                            the building program of the United States.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Reed-Matsudaira conversations, Shidehara stated that
                            Japan did not have a full account of them and this was one difficulty
                            because the Navy keeps asking if this or that proposition was advanced
                            by them. I feel that decision cannot be reached until next week for he
                            has not asked for full information on certain points.</p>
                        <p>Shidehara’s vigor of presentation or willingness to take responsibility
                            should not be distrusted for I am sure he fully realizes that his
                            statesmanship is at stake.</p>

                                p.m.</note> Agreement of the three delegations in regard to
                            replacement of <hi rend="italic">Furutaka</hi> class is that a
                            reservation will be inserted by Japan to the effect that at the next
                            conference she will be free to claim the right of replacement by a
                            10,000-ton cruiser of each vessel of that class when 20 years old. This
                            right of replacement will not be conceded by Great Britain or America
                            and if it is then asserted each will be free to oppose the claim. As
                            your telegram stated, your understanding of the matter is still correct.
                            We have been repeatedly asked by Matsudaira to surrender on this point
                            and until it became clear that neither Great Britain nor ourselves could
                            yield, he did not abandon his insistence.</p>
                        <p>Our agreement is here continually claimed by the newspapers as an
                            American proposal and they say that in Japan a counterproposal is being
                            considered. The lack of a public statement by either the Japanese
                            delegation or the Tokyo authorities that this is not an American
                            proposal but is in fact an agreement reached by the three delegations,
                            is surprising to us. Should Tokyo repudiate this agreement we would have
                            difficulty in continuing to negotiate with a delegation which is without
                            power and which its Government does not support. If the proposal is
                            repudiated by Tokyo or a so-called counterproposal is sent we will
                            immediately commence preparation of a two-power agreement with Great
                            Britain on auxiliary categories and the American delegation will return

                        <p>152. Tyrrell<note n="90" xml:id="d69fn90">Sir William G. Tyrrell, British
                                Ambassador in France.</note> this evening has advised MacDonald from
                            Paris that the following position has been decided upon by the French: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The French believe that their delegation cannot do anything
                                    more in London so long as France is being asked by Great Britain
                                    to lower her figures without entering into a Mediterranean
                                    agreement with her and so long as Italy’s demand for parity
                                    continues.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Therefore, if the British have decided to refuse a
                                    Mediterranean agreement and can do nothing more with the
                                    Italians and also will agree to let the French figures stand as
                                    they are, the French will help wind up the Conference with a
                                    report to the League which would contain certain agreements with
                                    respect to the regulation of reduction, naval holiday for
                                    certain construction, methods of limiting naval armament, and so
                                    forth.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Of last two clauses the former refers evidently to a battleship holiday
                            and the latter to certain recommendations of a minor character made by a
                            subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>The British press is asked by Tyrrell to exercise restraint; he reports
                            that the French press, though quiet, is well informed. He expects to
                            have a conference with Briand tomorrow to confirm the foregoing.
                            According to information which Tyrrell has received, Briand will not
                            return to London for several days and Tardieu will be away until the
                            31st, unless given assurance of [security pacts?] along above lines. In
                            the latter case they might return earlier.</p>
                        <p>A meeting of the heads of delegations will probably be called by
                            MacDonald tomorrow afternoon to consider this. It is my belief, based
                            upon my observations of the effect of the French attitude throughout the
                            Conference on other delegations and on public opinion here, that this
                            will end the attempt to secure a five-power agreement and that MacDonald
                            will try for a smaller one. Owing to the restlessness of the public,
                            there is grave doubt in my mind whether serious mutual press
                            recriminations can be successfully prevented. In the light of
                            MacDonald’s efforts, through which some real but slight steps toward
                            reconciling the figures of the French and Italians have been made, and
                            also because of the setback to the cause of the desire of Europe for
                            peace, this would be a great pity. MacDonald and Craigie think that
                            tonight’s decision will represent an effort by <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                                facs="0153"/>Tardieu, under the influence of certain extremists, to
                            force the issue in France’s favor. If so, it will almost certainly not
                            succeed and the result will probably be that the security France already
                            has will be greatly diminished. Our refusal to enter a consultative
                            pact, as you will notice, is not mentioned by the French as a reason for
                            their action. The view which I formerly expressed that there was no
                            intention on their part to rely upon such a pact from us is confirmed by
                            this.</p>

                        <p>54. Your telegram No. 53, March 20, 5 p.m. I think that there is no
                            danger that this matter will arise unless it is mentioned in the press.
                            The Government here has not considered it, so Shidehara tells me; one
                            reason is that it would scarcely be possible to arrive at a formula by
                            which China would not be irritated. We are not more sensitive than he is
                            on this point. He was told that, despite anything the press might say,
                            we should always consider the Kellogg Pact as effective as in any other
                            connection so far as China was concerned and that there was no necessity
                            of committing this to paper. Please repeat to London.<note n="91"

                                <item>That the Washington Treaty is superior to the proposal of

                                <item>That a valuable addition is made by the clause as to what is
                                    meant by safety.</item>

                                <item>That the change would be compensated for by French
                                    ratification. At the same time he thinks that the criticism that
                                    the Washington provision joins search and seizure regulations
                                    with rules for protection of life has no merit.</item>

                        <p>The rights of search and seizure furnish the only foundation for the
                            right to threaten lives on a merchant vessel, and the only basis for the
                            protection of such lives rests upon definite rules pertaining to such
                            rights.</p>

                        <p>156. The following is our survey of the situation.</p>
                        <p>(1) Negotiations as to the relative size of their fleets have been
                            conducted by the French and the Italians and by the French and the
                            British. On some of these negotiations, particularly those between the
                            British and the French, we have sat in at the request of both sides. I
                            have conferred many times with MacDonald, Briand, and Tardieu, in
                            addition to which Morrow has kept in constant touch with Aubert and
                            Massigli. The French, in coming to the Conference, we believe desired it
                            to succeed; however, from the first they have insisted upon a mutual
                            assistance security pact in which Britain would participate. France
                            would have substantially reduced her figures, we think, had she gotten
                            such a pact. Whether under Britain’s two-power European standard such
                            reduction would have been enough to meet the figures in the agreement we
                            have had with Great <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0156"/>Britain we
                            cannot say, because negotiations between Great Britain and France have
                            not gotten that far. We have never been asked directly by France to give
                            her a consultative pact; and we are certain, on information we have
                            gotten, that even had such a pact been offered she would not have, on
                            that basis alone, reduced her figures.</p>
                        <p>(2) A pivotal point in preventing an agreement between the British and
                            the French has been the unwillingness of MacDonald to satisfy the French
                            on the subject of European security. In his former administration, you
                            will remember, the protocol idea, so-called, with the purpose of
                            strengthening the League of Nations sanctions even to military
                            protection against an aggressor, was partly his doing. The subsequent
                            Conservative Government repudiated this tentative arrangement for the
                            protocol. Chamberlain substituted Locarno for this protocol idea. The
                            French assert, in this regard, that the hope was held out to them by the
                            British that the League would be strengthened not by a sweeping
                            agreement for sanctions but by a series of regional pacts, the parties
                            to which would be those countries having a vital interest in the
                            particular regions to be protected.</p>
                        <p>Ten months ago when MacDonald entered office there was under way in
                            England a decided reaction against that country entering into any
                            further sanctions through which they might become involved in a
                            continental struggle. With the coming of our negotiations, the French
                            demand for security through a Mediterranean Pact, which was suggested by
                            them in their December note, was refused by MacDonald, who has not since
                            forsaken that position. Two weeks ago French disquiet was added to by
                            his public statement in opposition to entangling alliances. The French
                            claim that they cannot understand this change from Britain’s former
                            attitude toward them. It would now be difficult, and perhaps impossible,
                            for the MacDonald Government to reverse itself completely in this
                            position, as there seems to be an increasing volume of public opinion in
                            Britain in support of MacDonald’s attitude toward keeping free from
                            further entanglement in continental affairs. Not all members of his own
                            Cabinet, however, have heartily supported this position. Henderson, who
                            was at Geneva for seven weeks negotiating the protocol in 1924, feels,
                            and has always felt, that Britain, provided she could get in return
                            definite naval reduction from France, should add to or at least reaffirm
                            definitely her European obligations. He criticizes France on the ground
                            that she does not offer great enough reduction of armament in return and
                            not because she asks for more security. In brief, he feels that France
                            never gave sufficient consideration in return for the Locarno Agreement,
                            although he feels it was all right for Britain to join this agreement
                            and even the protocol idea. The permanent officials of the British
                            Foreign Office, who realize that <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0157"
                            />they must continue to have France as their nearest neighbor, seem to
                            share Henderson’s feeling. Tyrrell, who is now in Paris and who has much
                            weight with the permanent officials, we have been told, shares this
                            view.</p>
                        <p>(3) The British effort, in place of the security pact, has principally
                            been to endeavor to secure from Italy for France a reduction
                            corresponding to or greater than that which she asks of France in order
                            to force the latter’s figures down. We have from time to time been
                            invited to sit in on these negotiations by both sides as friendly
                            impartial counselors, but have taken no part, though we have been
                            present. No substantial success has come from these negotiations. France
                            and Italy, both of whom have been very stubborn in their demands for
                            parity in the one case or superiority in the other in naval strength,
                            have toward the end shown some willingness to set aside their
                            theoretical positions and instead to stand upon reservations thereof
                            with the aim of adopting a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>.
                            Willingness to make concessions with regard to over-age tonnage has been
                            asserted by both, but as the matter stands neither has made any
                            concessions in building programs or under-age tonnage.</p>
                        <p>British opinion considers France’s submarine and perhaps her cruiser
                            program a serious menace, though we do not believe she is consciously
                            building against Great Britain. A series of unpleasant incidents, which
                            have occurred recently, have been the basis of suspicion and fear of
                            France and Italy toward each other. I have no evidence of any danger to
                            peace between the countries which is specific and imminent.</p>
                        <p>(4) The outcome of the interview between Tardieu and MacDonald last
                            Sunday, which was unfortunate, has complicated the situation during the
                            past week. Apparently MacDonald gave the French some ground for their
                            belief that he has appealed to Mussolini through the Ambassador to get
                            more definite figures. It was apparently through a French source that
                            the possibility of British influence at Rome leaked out to the press.
                            Both the Italians and MacDonald were greatly irritated. A dispute on
                            fact arose between the French and English as a result. There had already
                            existed a distrust between MacDonald and Tardieu, which has been added
                            to temporarily at least by this incident. The incident has also brought
                            forth a strong statement from the Fascist Council giving unqualified
                            support to insistence upon parity by Grandi. Of course we had no
                            representative at the meeting at Chequers, and I did not know of any
                            action which was being taken in Rome by MacDonald. I had, however,
                            solely for his information, apprised Garrett of the situation.<note
                                n="96" xml:id="d75fn96">John W. Garrett, American Ambassador in
                                Italy.</note></p>
                        <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0158"/>
                        <p>(5) Since day before yesterday when I sent my No. 152, MacDonald and I
                            have not talked; but on Sunday Craigie told me that Massigli has tried
                            to soften the position taken by the French as reported by Tyrrell from
                            Paris and claims that that report is exaggerated; that there is no
                            intention by Tardieu and Briand to end negotiations, but that the latter
                            will be back Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>(6) It will be seen from the foregoing that two fundamental controversies
                            exist, the first between the British and the French and the second
                            between the French and the Italians. We can properly take no leading
                            part in either. The parties to the controversies must themselves work
                            out their problem with such friendly help as we can give. A mistaken
                            idea as to the fundamental nature of the controversies is the basis, we
                            think, for the idea of the American press that by some simple act or
                            statement we could bring about their solution.</p>
                        <p>(7) The following is our position with reference to a consultative
                            pact:</p>
                        <p>I have made clear to Briand and Tardieu that a consultative pact is not
                            inherently objectionable to us, as we have already joined many of them,
                            of which the Washington Disarmament Treaty was one. I told them that
                            there was little doubt that a consultative provision with respect to
                            matters of naval program in a treaty growing out of the Conference would
                            be favored by us. I have made clear that our objection was to a pact
                            which, because of the circumstances under which it would be given, would
                            be considered as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for French
                            reduction in naval armament; that we objected to any pact which might be
                            the basis of a future demand for military assistance. Tardieu and Briand
                            have both told me that they fully appreciated that no pact could be
                            given by us which was subject to any construction of an implied promise
                            of military assistance. We have been assured by the French that what
                            they wanted and must have as a condition precedent to reduction of their
                            program was a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain, or at least that
                            Britain’s existing obligations under the Covenant of the League of
                            Nations be amplified or clarified. They consider this especially
                            important, because they believe that Britain apparently wishes to back
                            away from the European commitments which she already has made. A reason
                            or plausible excuse is thus afforded France for getting a navy of some
                            kind with the possibility facing them of confronting a European
                            situation with Great Britain neutral. French public opinion, from the
                            best sources we have, is solidly behind Tardieu and Briand. What the
                            French are asking of Great Britain is understandable if we consider the
                            continental agreements of the past decade, though we have no sympathy
                            with their action. Our belief is that France is seeking <pb n="79"
                                xml:id="pg_79" facs="0159"/>to force participation in European
                            sanctions by Britain through a French naval program very alarming to
                            public opinion in England. This is particularly true with reference to
                            France’s submarine program. Due to this the future of European politics
                            gives us serious anxiety.</p>
                        <p>(8) Should Great Britain and France resume negotiations it is possible
                            that a situation might arise in which it would be safe and appropriate
                            to make a promise of some consultation. This is for your consideration.
                            It might be of moment to both France and Great Britain if they had an
                            assurance that we could be consulted when an emergency arose with
                            respect to our method of exerting our peaceful influence toward
                            maintaining the world’s peace, in case Britain upon consideration,
                            should try to reach an agreement with France based upon some security
                            pact, or amplification or interpretation of their covenants under the
                            League as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the reduction of the
                            French Navy. The matter has been discussed by the delegation and we feel
                            that a consultative arrangement of this sort would have to be
                            safeguarded (1) by a separate security pact between France and Great
                            Britain, and (2) by specific clauses which would clearly and expressly
                            deny any promise of military assistance. The Rapidan joint statement of

                        <p>161. Morrow, Robinson, and I conferred with Alexander, Henderson, and
                            MacDonald yesterday. The conference was held at my suggestion, for I
                            wished to be sure that there existed no misunderstanding <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0160"/>as to the positions of our respective
                            delegations, especially where political pacts were concerned. The French
                            in their December note, you will recall, called attention to the
                            relationship existing between the questions of disarmament and security.
                            I reviewed the French position since that note, speaking of the way in
                            which they relied upon the Covenant of the League of Nations, and
                            particularly of the manner of the sanctions to be used against an
                            aggressor; also, of the desire of the French that a mutual assistance
                            pact be made, to which all Mediterranean countries would be a party, as
                            this would be a contributory reason toward armament reduction. I called
                            the Prime Minister’s attention to his reply to the French note and, as I
                            understood it, to the British position that they would be unwilling to
                            assume any continental obligations in addition to those they now had. I
                            told him that the French had repeatedly made it clear to us that they
                            wanted a treaty of mutual assistance as a condition of reduction of
                            armament; that in the absence of a formal request from them asking for
                            consultative provisions in the Pact of Paris, we had told them
                            definitely that a consultative pact could not be given them as a
                            substitute for the military mutual security which they desired.</p>
                        <p>I told MacDonald that we obviously could not, and had not, made any
                            suggestion as to reconsideration of Britain’s own situation with respect
                            to France, as that was a question in which she and her neighbors on the
                            continent were solely concerned. This situation seemed to be one of the
                            things holding up a five-power agreement. I had previously pointed out
                            to the Prime Minister the careful distinctions regarding the respective
                            contributions our two countries could make toward world peace as set out
                            in the Rapidan joint statement of October 9.</p>
                        <p>In the presence of Henderson and Alexander, MacDonald made two
                            statements, the first of which was that Britain would be willing to make
                            a formal statement of some sort to the French following the language in
                            annex F to the Locarno Agreement,<note n="98" xml:id="d76fn98"
                                >Collective note to Germany, December 1, 1926, regarding art. 16 of
                                the Covenant of the League of Nations, League of Nations Treaty
                                Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">liv</hi>, p. 299.</note> which
                            would make it clear that she would be bound to loyal and effective
                            cooperation in support of the Covenant and in resistance of an act of
                            aggression; but that France had not yet been advised of this intention.
                            Second, that Great Britain would be willing to participate in a later
                            conference of Mediterranean countries.</p>
                        <p>I then told the Prime Minister that if the other nations would take care
                            of the question of mutual assistance in such a way as to secure a
                            substantial reduction of armament, I should think it possible for us to
                            consider with an open mind the question of a provision for <pb n="81"
                                xml:id="pg_81" facs="0161"/>consultation among the signatories to
                            our agreement, with explicit denial of military action. Opinion was
                            expressed by Henderson that he thought the conference should proceed
                            along this line, provided substantial continental reduction in naval
                            armament could be secured thereby. Approval of what I had said was
                            expressed to the meeting by Senator Robinson, who afterward told me that
                            under these circumstances he did not think the treaty would be weakened
                            in the Senate by such a consultative provision.</p>

                        <p>258. Peace societies yesterday received three telegrams asserting that
                            statement was made by three American delegates in interviews that
                            everything would be settled if the President would take action in
                            offering a consultative pact. It is most embarrassing to have such
                            pressure applied in a matter regarding which we have heard nothing as to
                            wording or import.</p>
                        <p>It is asserted, they say, that if this were done Great Britain would be
                            enabled to give guarantees of a more formal character. These reports are
                            persistent and, obviously, annoying and the subject is being given much
                            space in the press.</p>
                        <p>We should know exactly the terms proposed before such a subject is given
                            consideration by you. Are you not able to reassure us as to the position
                            of the delegates? It would be helpful under the circumstances if you
                            could do so.</p>

                            London, has cabled to persons having a connection with the Foreign
                            Policy Association that important members of your staff have given him
                            information to the effect that dissatisfaction exists among the members
                            of the delegation due to their not having received from the President
                            constructive support, and that it is felt by them <pb n="82"
                                xml:id="pg_82" facs="0162"/>that if he would follow the

                            delegation, he could save the situation with the French.</p>
                        <p>We have stopped a move of the Foreign Policy Association to call a
                            general meeting in New York for the purpose of protesting the action of
                            the Administration and the President.</p>
                        <p>The advices in your No. 156, March 23, strictly contradict the foregoing.
                            We believe that the whole idea of such a pact has been originated by
                            those New York groups who have been trying to secure its advancement at
                            the Conference. They have used propaganda here, and we think that some
                            of the French delegation have contacts with Stone or other agents of
                            theirs and from them have gotten some encouragement. Through such

                            facts which you have given us, and endeavor to find out which member of
                            your staff has been giving out information which is being used against
                            the work of the delegation and the Administration.</p>
                        <p>We think that dangerous ground is being trodden both in the interests of
                            our country and delegation by outside groups who take it upon themselves
                            to put forth ideas and to establish activities with other
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>The President today, because of this agitation, stated to the press, not
                            for publication nor to be attributed to any authority, that no
                            government represented at the Conference had proposed a consultative
                            pact to the United States. He said that the terms advocated by outside
                            groups for such a pact would not reduce tonnage at all and that other
                            governments know fully that the United States cannot enter any pact
                            which implied either directly or indirectly the use of naval forces;
                            that the pacts proposed by these groups were not of this nature and the
                            situation was not met or assisted by them; and that it was an entirely
                            unwarranted belief on their part that the United States’ offering of
                            such a pact would secure reduction of tonnage.</p>

                        <p>162. The following statement was issued last night by the delegation in
                            view of the rumors current in certain of the British newspapers,
                            particularly the <hi rend="italic">Daily Herald</hi>, that the United
                            States had changed its point of view on the matter of consultative
                            pacts: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Rumor was current last evening to the effect that the American
                                    delegation had made a change of their attitude toward
                                    consultative pacts and were willing to enter into such a pact
                                    for the purpose of saving the Conference. It was authoritatively
                                    denied at the headquarters of the American delegation that any
                                    change had taken place in the attitude of the American
                                    delegation, and its attitude remains as its spokesmen gave it
                                    out several weeks ago. At that time it was made clear [that]
                                    America had no objection to enter[ing] a consultative pact as
                                    such; on the contrary, the United States is already a party to a
                                    number of treaties involving the obligation of consulting with
                                    other powers. It will not, however, enter into any treaty,
                                    whether consultative or otherwise, where there is danger of its
                                    obligation being misunderstood as involving a promise to render
                                    military assistance or guaranteeing protection by military force
                                    to another nation. Such a misunderstanding might arise, if the
                                    United States entered into such a treaty as a <hi rend="italic"
                                        >quid pro quo</hi> for the reduction of the naval force of
                                    another power. That danger has hitherto inhered in the present
                                    situation, where France has been demanding mutual military
                                    security as a condition of naval reduction, as appears from her
                                    original statement of her case last December. If, however, this
                                    demand for security could be satisfied in some other way, then
                                    the danger of misunderstanding a consultative pact would be
                                    eliminated and in such case the question would be approached
                                    from an entirely different standpoint. In such a case the
                                    American delegation would consider the matter with an entirely
                                    open mind.”</p>

                        <p>163. 1. Nothing of the nature mentioned in your telegram No. 258, March
                            25, has been said by any American delegate. No attention should be paid
                            to it, for it is nonsense. In my telegram No. 156, March 23, paragraphs
                            7 and 8, and in my telegram No. 161, March 25, I stated our position on
                            a consultative pact and it has not changed. I can assure the President
                            that nothing coming from this delegation is responsible for this
                            situation and I am sorry he has been troubled.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>3. Statement by President, mentioned in your telegram No. 259, March 25,
                            is entirely in accord with our position and is accurate in every
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>4. I learned that a story was to be published by the <hi rend="italic"
                                >London Herald</hi> to the effect that owing to the intervention of
                            the President our delegation had completely changed its position on a
                            consultative pact, so I issued my press statement last evening. Today
                            the situation changed in favor of a five-power treaty. I was told by
                            MacDonald that my statement helped greatly. I believe Great Britain has
                            at last changed its position with regard to security for France.
                            Although I have discreetly refrained from inquiry I believe this to be a
                            fact. I am informed by MacDonald that Briand will arrive tonight. He
                            will discuss pacts with Henderson tomorrow. Mac-Donald also informed me
                            that this morning the French had reduced their figures considerably;
                            they are now within about 400,000 tons total tonnage of meeting the
                            figures of the British. The trend for the last 24 hours has been more
                            encouraging than anything we have experienced for a long time, but there
                            are many difficulties still remaining in the road. I had lunch with
                            Lloyd George. He has been pessimistic and seemingly antagonistic but he
                            now seems to think the Conference will be successful. His statement is
                            significant, as his coalition is a big factor in keeping MacDonald in
                            office.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of this change and the possibility of a security agreement
                            between Great Britain and France, it is very likely that a consultative
                            pact of the nature suggested in my Nos. 156 and 161 will be brought to
                            the front. I assume that if we adhere to the safeguards enumerated by me
                            it will meet with the President’s approval. Next week we shall probably
                            have an important plenary session. There will be a review of the
                            progress made to date, and it may well be that an opportunity will be
                            presented at that time or later <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0165"
                            />at which a message to the American delegation from the President can
                            be presented with powerful effect to the Conference. This possibility we
                            will consider and we will let you know in time if it seems
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>6. Tokyo reports remain encouraging; they counsel patience on ground that
                            Government is making progress towards a favorable conclusion. I am
                            informed from British and American sources that French have worked hard
                            to delay or disrupt an agreement with Japan, in submarine figures
                            particularly.</p>

                                    paragraph 2 of the Pacific Pact. The two settings present this
                                    essential difference: With respect to Europe, if included in the
                                    present treaty, it would apply to every European political
                                    disturbance which might affect any one of the five parties; with
                                    respect to the Pacific Pact, we have possessions in the East and
                                    the Pact refers solely to those possessions.</item>

                                    country’s policy not to become involved in controversies with

                                    interpreted as a declaration of the purpose to dominate the
                                    world by five naval powers. It is true that even the adoption of
                                    the above modified form if it employed the word “consultation”
                                    would be interpreted in all probability as leaving the
                                    implication of conference and it should not be “consultation”
                                    but rather “communication.”</item>

                                <item>It appears to us important that, as early as possible and
                                    prior to further discussion as to a consultative pact, your
                                    Conference ascertain whether or not France will be satisfied
                                    enough with the sanctions which Great Britain is willing to
                                    offer to reduce her terms to an approved level before you
                                    discuss the terms of any arrangement which they may ask of you.
                                    As any arrangement which might be made by you would have to be
                                    so diluted as not to be particularly valuable, it would seem
                                    improbable that any consultative arrangement would be asked of
                                    you. We think the above course best because the whole matter in
                                    public discussion on this side has assumed undue

                        <p>165. Referring to your telegram No. 265, March 26. We have no idea of
                            following the form of the Four-Power Pacific Treaty, as we are already
                            fully aware of the dangers. We have also been considering the
                            advisability of ascertaining the extent to which the French would be
                            willing to reduce their building program, before we bind ourselves <pb

                            the British and French are now carrying on. I have had in mind, in

                        <p>167. It was decided by the heads of delegations this afternoon to hold a
                            plenary session on Friday, April 4, when full reports and discussions
                            will be made of the progress of the Conference up to that date. Briand
                            has been in conference during the day with the British and I understand
                            that with respect to figures encouraging progress is being made. The
                            pessimism that MacDonald had last week has changed and he is now hopeful
                            for a treaty by the five powers.</p>
                        <p>Morrow, Robinson, Reed, and Dawes this afternoon produced a suggestion
                            for a consultative clause to be placed in the naval treaty. This was
                            done after a long and thorough conference. I examined it, upon my return
                            from meeting, and I believe it the best suggestion thus far. I think it
                            meets the limitations I had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The following is the suggestion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The signatories hereto shall settle all disputes between them by
                                    pacific means. As to what measures may be adopted to maintain
                                    peace among them, the high contracting parties shall consult
                                    with <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0168"/>one another frankly
                                    and fully but this agreement to consult or any consultation
                                    between the parties shall not imply a commitment on the part of
                                    the signatories or any of them to use military force or take any
                                    coercive action.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Senators Robinson and Reed feel sure that such a clause would be approved
                            by the Senate; they also feel strongly that it would not be helped and
                            might be harmed by a declaration “that the policy of the United States
                            is not to entangle itself in European controversies.”</p>
                        <p>I send the suggestion along to you for your consideration and any comment
                            you may care to make.</p>

                                <item>With regard to a consultative pact, friends of the
                                    Administration in the Senate indicate an overwhelming Senate
                                    opposition. Intimations from Senators George and Swanson also
                                    indicate this to be true. They do not know the terms of such a
                                    pact, of course, but they contemplate that it is akin to the
                                    Pacific Pact. We are positive that a consultative pact in terms
                                    of the Pacific Pact would be impossible of ratification at
                                    present but if it were of a different nature and sufficiently
                                    limited there might be a change of opinion.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We are of the opinion that the British and French negotiations
                                    should be settled before any discussion of the text of the
                                    consultative pact is entered upon, although we do not wish our
                                    view on tactics to override your views. To put it another way,
                                    we should not engage in this problem until the British and
                                    French have settled their guarantees on one side and their
                                    tonnage on the other; for with the obvious leaks of every text
                                    and detail of your negotiations, the pact will become the
                                    battleground here and will overshadow the entire disarmament
                                    program. It is not desirable to have it develop unnecessarily to
                                    a serious question, for if the negotiations between Great
                                    Britain and France should fail it would unnecessarily
                                    consolidate opposition to any form of agreement. We take it that
                                    no such pact will be included in a three-power treaty. Moreover,
                                    we think it very desirable that the other delegations should
                                    present the form of the consultative clause and by stating your
                                    receptive position you have laid the groundwork for this
                                    already. They should be warned that nothing in the nature of the
                                    text of the Pacific Pact would be possible but this should be
                                    done at an appropriate time. It is <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                                        facs="0169"/>suggested that you might consider repeating
                                    from the Kellogg Pact the two important paragraphs as a preamble
                                    to any other undertaking.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In our view, the text of the pact ought to come from some other
                            governments and the reason is that if we presented the text the effort
                            of the other delegations, undoubtedly, would be to put more teeth in it
                            and we might fail on the question of words, the import of which would be
                            almost impossible to establish clearly in the mind of the public.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, should they present a form of pact of as moderate a
                            basis and we proceeded to take any teeth out, our position would be much
                            stronger here.</p>

                        <p>271. I think you should understand the President’s position regarding a
                            consultative pact and I, therefore, submit the following for your own
                            personal information. From the very beginning, his attitude, as you
                            know, has been against inclusion of any political undertaking as a part
                            of disarmament agreement. Both of us were of the opinion that the
                            Kellogg Pact was the political basis for reduction of arms at the
                            present.</p>
                        <p>At the time this situation began to loom up as a result of peace society
                            and French propaganda, we observed from your telegrams Nos. 126, 128,
                            136, and 152<note n="3a" xml:id="d86fn3a"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,

                            growing out of the Conference and of the general purport of the
                            Washington Armament Treaty. We had no intimation that there was any
                            possible change until we received your No. 156;<note n="3b"

                            British, was received before we were able to reply to your No. 156.</p>
                        <p>At his press conference the same day but before the receipt of your Nos.
                            156 and 161, the President made a strong statement to the <pb n="90"
                                xml:id="pg_90" facs="0170"/>newspapers, not for quotation, to the
                            effect that such a pact would be of no purpose or effect on reduction of
                            tonnage, relying of course on your previous statements. He has
                            continuously advised Senators, newspaper editors, and other persons who
                            have been agitating this question that no political action could be
                            taken by this Government. He is much pressed, therefore, on the
                            inconsistency of the present situation. He does not intend to embarrass
                            the negotiations, however, by explanations or other statements but he is
                            of the opinion that any form of political pact would very likely
                            strengthen the opposition of big navy people by including others.</p>
                        <p>We are of the opinion that this situation leads to some important
                            considerations.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, there should be strict limitation of our commitments within
                                the spirit of the President’s Armistice Day speech.<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d86fn4">Delivered on November 11, 1929; <hi

                                    505.</note></item>
                            <item>Second, a political pact should be a separate treaty from the
                                naval treaty as was the case of the Pacific treaties, so that if the
                                political pact should not receive confirmation it would not put the
                                disarmament program in danger; and at some appropriate time our
                                colleagues in the Conference could be informed that it would be
                                impossible for us to guarantee ratification and that two treaties
                                must not be contingent upon each other.</item>
                            <item>Third, we should be fully advised as to any new departure in the
                                negotiations even though it would mean delay, so we could have time
                                to reflect on it before you indicate your position.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This is merely an explanation of the difficulties which confront us here
                            and the things that should be safeguarded against, and the President
                            does not wish you to think that this is in the nature of criticism.</p>
                        <p>The President and I suggest that you consider a repetition of the two
                            vital clauses of the Kellogg Pact, instead of the formula in your No.

                                    Shidehara, who said that it was very friendly and that he
                                    himself would give it to Hamaguchi. A message from MacDonald was
                                    delivered in the same manner by the British Ambassador. Both he
                                    and Shidehara urged me not to attempt to see Hamaguchi
                                    personally, as to do so would produce a dangerous public
                                    reaction. If you were here you would understand the need of
                                    extreme caution. It is most essential to prevent private
                                    conversations with many influential men.</p>
                                <p>Much discussion has taken place in the press over whether or not
                                    the Japanese delegation is actually back of the agreement; the
                                    Navy intransigents are still calling it “the American proposal”,
                                    in spite of the fact that frequent denials have been made. The
                                    papers say that you discussed the question with Wakatsuki on
                                    March 25; I should find it very helpful to know the real
                                    attitude of the Japanese delegation.”</p>

                                    <item>Ambassador Houghton on his return from London brought to
                                        my attention almost a year ago the British desire for
                                        consultative arrangements with us as a precaution against a
                                        clash between our Navies when the British Fleet was serving
                                        as an ancillary to the League of Nations and might thus
                                        interfere with our trade. This danger is well known; it has
                                        been the subject of frequent discussion and the attention of
                                        British statesmen has been preoccupied by it. The purpose of
                                        such a consultative arrangement would be to obviate friction
                                        between the United States outside the League and a Europe
                                        organized under the League. Particularly as the British Navy
                                        will be supported by the navies of the other members of the
                                        League, it is important for us to know what course will be
                                        pursued by it in case of an impending emergency. Eventually
                                        such consultations are certain to take place; it would,
                                        however, appear of great advantage to all parties if they
                                        should occur prior to the creation of an irrevocable <pb

                                        the League Council’s vote. It appears to me that a
                                        consultative pact of this kind is the only one having a
                                        direct connection with this Conference’s problems, for the
                                        British have been embarrassed by the absence of such
                                        consultation in fulfilling their obligations under the
                                        League of Nations and the Locarno Agreement toward the
                                        French and therefore French security is impaired in the

                                    <item>At the time of the Russo-Chinese crisis last summer,
                                        Claudel, acting for Briand, suggested to me that, in order
                                        to provide machinery to meet such a situation, there be
                                        added to the Kellogg Pact a consultative clause based on the
                                        Four-Power Pacific Treaty. While I have always felt that a
                                        clause of this kind offered many difficulties to the Kellogg
                                        Pact and have had a preference for other machinery which I
                                        have had in mind, nevertheless I expressed myself as being
                                        ready to discuss the proposition.</item>

                                    <item>The French in their note to the British on December 20, on
                                        the subject of the Naval Conference, brought up their demand
                                        for an agreement as to mutual assistance. They suggested
                                        different forms which such assistance might take, for
                                        example, the amplification and clarification of the Locarno
                                        Agreements now existing and a Mediterranean Pact. Because of
                                        this demand and its temporary refusal by the British, as I
                                        have stated before, it was impossible for the United States
                                        to consider any political pact, even solely for
                                        consultation, as a substitute for the French demand, for
                                        fear that it would lead in the future to misunderstandings
                                        as to the scope of American obligations.</item>

                                    <item>My press conference of March 11 was prompted by this
                                        confusion of legitimate consultation with implied
                                        obligations. In that conference I made it clear that our
                                        objection was not to consultative pacts in themselves, but
                                        to the circumstances which surrounded the broaching of the
                                        question. In my many conferences with Mac-Donald I also made

                                Office. Since he retained personal control over the negotiations and
                                was decidedly in opposition to the granting of the French demand,
                                those who thought otherwise could never discuss the question of a
                                change in this attitude.</item>

                            <item>Upon receipt of advices from Tyrrell on the evening of March 21,
                                as I reported in No. 152, March 22, MacDonald apparently thought it
                                impossible to bring about an agreement between the five powers. I
                                think such a feeling on his part was justified, in view of Tyrrell’s
                                advices and MacDonald’s own views with respect to the French. On
                                Saturday, March 22, there was a strong effort made, apparently by
                                the permanent officials of the Foreign Office, to further, even on
                                new lines, a five-power agreement. Apparently Henderson sympathizes
                                with their view. That the Conference was on the brink of a
                                precipice, with the consequent disastrous result to the whole
                                European peace situation which would follow failure on such issues,
                                was recognized by all parties. Consequently all parties attempted to
                                canvass entire situation prior to a break which would be final. A
                                meeting at one o’clock on Saturday, the 22d, was held by our own
                                delegation, at which time the situation was discussed from all
                                angles. Craigie told me last Saturday that Massigli’s view of the
                                situation was that it was not so hopeless as Tyrrell’s report
                                indicated. Therefore, we sent you our No. 156, on Sunday, March 23,
                                containing our complete summary of the situation.</item>

                            <item>I sought the conference with Alexander, Henderson, and Mac-Donald
                                on Monday morning, March 24, as reported to you in my telegram No.
                                161, March 25, because it had become clear to us that there were
                                decidedly different points of view in the British delegation as to
                                the proper course to pursue with respect to France and because we
                                were unwilling to have any possibility of misunderstanding with us
                                prevent the saving of the situation. This was the first real
                                opportunity we had had to discuss with the Prime Minister and
                                Henderson the question which seemed to be holding up the Conference.
                                Obviously the question which the French regarded as fundamental was
                                what was the true British position with respect to the clauses in
                                the Covenant of the League of Nations providing for mutual
                                assistance. The British had been a party to these clauses for more
                                than a decade, but the apprehensions of the French had been aroused
                                by Mac-Donald’s attitude. Especially did his radio speech on
                                “entangling alliances” disturb them.</item>

                            <item>French diplomatic and journalistic methods throughout the
                                Conference have apparently irritated MacDonald, whose great
                                patience, tact, and industry have characterized his conduct of the
                                negotiations. We have felt, as we viewed the general peace problem
                                of Europe, that Henderson’s view toward France was the sounder one.
                                I believe I am accurate in saying that the spirit of that portion

                                consent to become entangled in European diplomacy and the other is
                                resolved to pursue a policy of active cooperation with its European

                            <item>The importance of my statement made on March 24th to the British,
                                which merely repeated what I had already said to Tardieu, Briand,
                                and MacDonald (emphasized, however, by the impending crisis), was
                                that it gave Henderson his first opportunity to urge upon MacDonald
                                a reconsideration of the British position toward the French; and
                                MacDonald had evidently been won over to Henderson’s view by Tuesday
                                morning, as the latter then was given authority by the Prime
                                Minister to telephone to Briand at Paris that they would discuss the
                                subject of mutual security with the French. The French themselves
                                had, at the same time, evidently experienced the beneficial effect
                                of the threatened failure of the Conference and the invitation to
                                return to London was accepted by Briand. In the French afternoon
                                papers of Tuesday incorrect and sensational accounts of the changes
                                in the situation were already appearing; and the necessity of our
                                midnight statement was occasioned by these incorrect accounts
                                reaching London that same evening.</item>

                                the impending failure of the Conference produced and during which an

                                by our statement. I need not tell the President how much I regret
                                that my statement, contained in my telegram No. 156, failed to reach
                                him before he had given out his press statement on Tuesday. It was
                                sent at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and there had been inserted sections (7)
                                and (8) expressly to warn you that the matter of a consultative pact
                                might come up, although we were surprised with the rapidity with
                                which matters moved. I appreciate the fine sporting spirit of the
                                President toward us in the face of the extreme difficulty into which

                            will help, that the President has sent a personal message for them. You

                            follows. It is our object to emphasize to the French that if American
                            cooperation is to be secured, it should be accomplished by dealing with
                            positive problems successfully and to build up gradually the principles

                                <p>I have given a great deal of consideration to the position of our

                                <p>1. Following the World War we have had a period in the United
                                    States of strong reaction against any cooperation in general
                                    plans for methodical procedure in settlement of international
                                    controversies. The distance of our people from Europe, their
                                    inability to appreciate fully the difficulties of European
                                    statesmen, and the differences between European political
                                    constitutions and our own, together with deep dissensions and
                                    disappointments which have arisen here out of our participation
                                    in the great war—have all confirmed the inherited and deep
                                    instinct of our people against being involved in any
                                    international action with Europe.</p>
                                <p>Framed largely by the genius of Mr. Briand, the Pact of Paris
                                    gave a formula which found complete and ready acceptance in the
                                    American mind. The outlawry of war was a noble and simple basis
                                    for the preservation of peace in which this country was
                                    generally in agreement. There was general agreement also in the
                                    idea that there must be always sought pacific means for the
                                    settlement of international controversies and that public
                                    opinion, informed and enlightened, <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"
                                        facs="0177"/>is a most potent power to that end. But the
                                    American mind has not come to the point of accepting any general
                                    plan of methodical procedure for the pacific settlement of
                                    international disputes and particularly, it is not ready to
                                    commit itself to any plan in cases of violation of the Pact of
                                    Paris or as to action in cases of aggression.</p>
                                <p>But the American mind is, I think, ready to take up and consider,
                                    and, I believe, approve certain immediate and obviously
                                    practicable steps which will do much to obviate and to remove
                                    the source of international controversies and thus help prevent
                                    war. The American people have before them the plan to enter the

                                    such legal questions as we may from time to time be ready to
                                    submit to the Court for decision. That is a simple proposal
                                    consonant with our traditional principles and acceptable to the
                                    American mind.</p>
                                <p>We could, no doubt, from time to time take up other definite,
                                    limited questions which bear on world peace. One we are ready
                                    now to take up as to naval arms.</p>
                                <p>2. We believe that the outstanding controversy of the world today
                                    is competition in naval arms and the excessive size of navies in
                                    the light of the presumed reorientation of world thought to a
                                    purely defensive basis through the Pact of Paris. In our
                                    participation in a conference of the naval powers to settle this
                                    question, the United States has joined in a practical instance
                                    in a possible methodical settlement of controversies by pacific
                                    means which, if successful, would pave the way for the natural
                                    development of cooperation in settlement of other age-old
                                    controversies which imperil the peace of the world. Success in
                                    such practical steps one by one seems the way the American
                                    people are prepared to accept more systematic or automatic
                                    methods of procedure of international cooperation.</p>
                                <p>3. In the matter of general security we had conceived that by our
                                    preliminary negotiation with the British (through which we had
                                    eliminated the hitherto primary bar to any settlement of the
                                    naval question) we were in fact making a very distinct
                                    contribution toward the security of France. The result of these
                                    negotiations promised a reduction of the British fleet by some
                                    300,000 or 400,000 tons, a reduction of the American fleet by
                                    some 200,000 tons, substantial reduction of the Japanese
                                    fleet—which very reductions add materially to the security of
                                    France and the world. It was our feeling that these measures
                                    were the very fundamentals of practical progress toward security
                                    in the world and they were even more important as establishing
                                    the principle of cooperation with the other nations in the
                                    elimination of war.</p>
                                <p>It is the view of American public men that we have an obligation
                                    to serve in the cause of peace among nations and we believe it
                                    is the desire of other nations that we should so serve.
                                    Recognizing the realities of our situation, however, this
                                    cooperation can best be developed, as I have said, by dealing
                                    with limited and positive questions as they may arise.”</p>

                        <p>281. We assume that the statement issued by the British last night ends
                            the possibility of any five-power pact.<note n="13" xml:id="d92fn13">On
                                March 30 a statement issued to the press from No. 10 Downing St.,
                                the residence of the British Prime Minister, and printed in the
                                morning papers on March 31 said in part that “any further military
                                or naval commitments are impossible, for that would be tantamount to
                                tying ourselves down to military operations without being able to
                                control the situation from which they have arisen. No British
                                Government could undertake such commitments, which would be contrary
                                to the whole feeling of the British people.”</note> If this is
                            correct, it would seem to us most vital and urgent that every effort
                            should be made by you in the direction of a three-power agreement. An
                            agreement of this kind would accomplish the greater portion of that
                            which we have tried to bring about in the stabilization and reduction of
                            arms. A setting would be created by it and we believe that at a later
                            date the other nations would have to adhere in practice, even though
                            they never do so by signature. It is as important from a national point
                            of view as it is to the world. Although all we wish might not be gotten
                            under our final terms with the Japanese, at the same time our ultimate
                            aims with respect to the world are advanced and the cause of world peace
                            is saved from the great disaster of a break-down.</p>

                        <p>282. It would seem to us, if it is certain that there is no longer a
                            possibility of a five-power agreement, that you might deem it advisable
                            to convey a message to the Prime Minister from the President to the
                            effect that the Rapidan conferences took cognizance of the possibility
                            of a three-power treaty; that at that time such a treaty was thought
                            feasible if the effort to induce the other powers to join was not
                            successful; that it is the President’s belief that such a step would in
                            large measure fulfill the high purpose of both the Prime Minister and
                            himself. A great advance in world stabilization would in itself be made
                            by cooperation between Japan, Great Britain, and the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>There can well be introduced into such a treaty provisions to protect the
                            British in case of antagonistic naval building; the taking of such
                            action by any nation, however, with consequent upsetting of a major plan
                            of stability, would in all probability be brought to a halt by the
                            feeling of world understanding. The President believes that a crisis has
                            now been reached, when nothing should be left undone to prevent what may
                            be a backward step in the world peace movement. It would be deplorable
                            to have that movement checked.</p>

                        <p>181. Your telegrams Nos. 281 and 282, March 31, 6 p.m., and 7 p.m.,
                            respectively. Reports of our death are greatly exaggerated. Last evening
                            at 5 o’clock the British submitted their proposal to the French for the
                            clarification of the Covenant relations of the two powers, and the
                            document was read to me at 6 o’clock. As I understand the British
                            propositions, they so nearly approach the French demands that I doubt
                            very much that the French will reject them. MacDonald expects a reply
                            tomorrow; and this morning he tells me that he is very hopeful. He is of
                            the opinion that the firmness of the British statement, to which you
                            referred, has cleared the atmosphere and has made the French more
                            amenable. I have been working for a three-power treaty as my second line
                            of reserve since I arrived here. I shall continue to work for a
                            five-power treaty as long as I deem it to be within the bounds of
                            possibility, for I feel that the high purposes mentioned in your
                            suggested message from the President to MacDonald will be far better
                            served by a five-power treaty than by a three-power treaty.</p>

                                    only dreaded reaction of the Navy. Insistence that agreement

                                    the right is reserved by Japan to ask 70 percent, will be the

                                    threatening note was transmitted to Hamaguchi and that the

                                    England. Had this been published several days ago, it might have
                                    been disastrous, and would have been deeply resented. It is
                                    fortunate that this was not done, and even more so that the

                        <p>195. The reply of the Japanese Government was presented by the delegation
                            at a meeting with the American and the British delegations this
                            afternoon. It was substantially a complete acceptance of the compromise
                            agreement submitted to Tokyo. The reply was accompanied by a note from
                            the Japanese Government which was very good-spirited and considerate,
                            and the British feel, as do we, that they have acted in the finest of
                            spirit in the entire matter. Another meeting at 11 tomorrow was asked
                            for by Wakatsuki in order that further details, evidently of minor
                            character, might be discussed. After that meeting a full report of the
                            settlement with the Japanese will be sent you.</p>
                        <p>Both the British and the French seem hopeful and encouraged, and
                            negotiations between them are proceeding actively. Since last week there
                            has been a change in the entire spirit of the Conference, and it now
                            seems that even though the French and the Italians cannot be included in
                            a five-power agreement at the present time, matters in which they are
                            concerned could be left so that there would be a very good prospect of
                            their prompt inclusion; it looks at present, however, as though they
                            will be included in the settlement now.</p>
                        <p>Adjournment of the plenary meeting was made owing to the feeling of all
                            of us that the negotiations between the British and the French were so
                            hopeful that it would be advisable that they be given, without a public
                            statement, a few days more, as in that time they <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0181"/>may be able to come to an agreement
                            which could be announced simultaneously with the Japanese result.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow morning Briand is coming to see me, and I shall then give the
                            President’s message to him.</p>

                        <p>199. Our meeting with the British and the Japanese took place this
                            morning without bringing forth any serious obstacles to the prompt
                            settlement of the agreement with Japan. The serious problem of
                            unemployment in the Japanese shipyards might make it necessary for the
                            Government to ask the privilege of premature replacement of a portion of
                            their cruiser, destroyer, and submarine tonnage in order to give
                            employment, without altering, however, the total tonnages. Neither the
                            British nor we see any objection to this. The matter is now referred to
                            an experts committee to outline a schedule. The Japanese have also asked
                            us for permission to make a limited transfer between certain categories,
                            but it is our impression that this request was made as a matter of form
                            in order to satisfy their Navy party, and that it is not expected to be
                            accepted by either the British or us.</p>
                        <p>This morning Briand called on me for an hour and a half. Morrow was
                            present also. I read the President’s message to Briand, and he expressed
                            appreciation, saying that he quite understood the limitations of
                            American action. He expressed his gratitude to us for our having given
                            the push that broke the jam between the British and the French last
                            week, and told us about his negotiations since that date with the
                            British. These have been confined wholly to question of the redefinition
                            and affirmation of British responsibilities under the League of Nations;
                            Briand stated that he considered the two nations were very close
                            together. Tonnage figures had not yet been discussed, however, and no
                            further progress has been made with the Italians; but if the British and
                            the French get together, the pressure upon the Italians will become very
                            heavy.</p>

                        <p>300. The press despatches lead us to believe that a three-power pact is
                            the inevitable conclusion, in view of the improbability of finding a
                            basis between the French and Italians or even the French and British. If
                            the British are prepared to come along on the Rapidan figures and your
                            subsequent battleship arrangements, we think that a three-power pact
                            will be regarded as a distinct victory, and a reasonable political
                            clause protecting the signatories in case of menacing construction will
                            not be regarded as out of line.</p>
                        <p>A five-power pact, of course, is what we would all prefer but we are of
                            the opinion that we run some danger in extending negotiations, for the
                            failure of the five-power treaty is at present clearly upon the French
                            and Italians but they might turn the tables by making such demands on
                            the United States as would appear to place upon us the responsibility.
                            Moreover the five-power treaty with consultative provision stronger than
                            that which we telegraphed might cause breakdown of the Conference if
                            demands were made for more teeth in the consultative pact than we could
                            secure agreement for. I am sure it would create great opposition here if
                            it were made stronger than that which we telegraphed.<note n="18"

                        <p>202. Your telegram No. 300, April 4. After conference with Briand this
                            morning, MacDonald and Craigie informed Morrow and myself of the
                            situation at luncheon. Briand is taking with him to Paris this afternoon
                            security plan for the consideration of the French Government, as
                            mentioned in my telegram No. 200, yesterday. Conferences will be resumed
                            Tuesday afternoon upon his return from Paris. He refused to discuss
                            tonnage figures, stating that the French Government would have to decide
                            first how much the proposed security plan was worth in tonnage. After
                            consultation with his Government he is to transmit figures by telegraph.
                            The security plan will be considered by the British Cabinet when it
                            meets Monday. Therefore, there is still hope of a five-power agreement,
                            but MacDonald’s mind, I can see, is influenced very much by the evident
                            reaction in British opinion against further political commitments of
                            whatever nature in the European situation. Therefore, we discussed at
                            our luncheon a three-power agreement coupled with efforts to secure
                            inclusion of France and Italy. I impressed upon MacDonald importance of
                            at least beginning with Rapidan figures in the three-power agreement
                            even though the British Government would soon be compelled to increase
                            its tonnage, particularly in destroyers, in order to meet French
                            submarine construction in the future. Mac-Donald stated emphatically
                            that he would begin with the Rapidan figures although the French
                            program, he feared, would compel a <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104"
                                facs="0184"/>change within two years, if it were continued. I
                            informed him of the substance of your views contained in your telegram
                            No. 300, April 4, and he fully appreciated their force. I am of the
                            opinion that the probable outcome will be a three-power treaty. You must
                            remember, however, that although the present French-British and
                            French-American atmosphere and relations are good and infinitely better
                            now than 10 days ago, yet it will be rather difficult to preserve the
                            atmosphere from deteriorating unless an agreement is decided upon by the
                            five powers; therefore all of us feel that a much greater stability will
                            be given to our work and the European situation in general if the French
                            and Italians can be brought into the settlement. To secure that end, we
                            are therefore continuing our efforts.</p>

                        <p>207. MacDonald told me that on Monday the Cabinet had trimmed down his
                            security proposal, and that the leaders of the Conservative and the
                            Liberal Parties had also objected to parts of it. Consequently, he had
                            slightly modified its language. I expected, therefore, that on Briand’s
                            return there would be a prompt decision against a five-power treaty.
                            MacDonald told me, however, after his meeting with Briand last evening,
                            that the security negotiations were not rejected, that the French were
                            very conciliatory and were evidently anxious for an agreement.
                            Negotiations are still on, and at last tonnage figures are to be taken
                            up this morning by the British and the French, Alexander acting for the
                            former and Dumesnil for the latter. The French-Italian deadlock still
                            remains. The Prime Minister intimated that by this evening he would know
                            the fate of the five-power treaty.</p>
                        <p>Nearly all of the questions raised by the Japanese have been settled, and
                            today we hope to settle what remains. Yesterday all five powers in the
                            First Committee adopted unanimously the form of the proposed declaration
                            of international law as to protecting lives of the crew and passengers
                            from submarine attack. The form is that which was last submitted to

                            auxiliary tonnage fail. If that happens, there are still several
                            important subjects for a five-power treaty and it is our purpose to
                            provide a framework for keeping the five powers together for future

                                    adjourns.</item>

                        <p>If the progress we are making seems to be distressingly slow, please
                            remember that the British leaders, as result of their parliamentary and
                            other work, are able to give only fraction of their time to the
                            Conference itself, and that MacDonald is very despondent and very tired.
                            I have made the President’s suggestions regarding the advantages of a
                            three-power treaty quite clear to the Prime Minister, but the decision,
                            of course, as to when to cease efforts for a five-power agreement
                            necessarily rests with him.</p>

                        <p>211. We settled all questions with Japanese this morning, thus entirely
                            closing the three-power agreement. MacDonald informed me later that,
                            after conferring with Briand, the British had practically given up hope
                            of agreement with Italy and France on auxiliary tonnage. In order to
                            forestall any acrimonious termination of the Conference, we took up at
                            once the proposition for the conclusion of a composite treaty on general
                            basis outlined in my telegram No. 207, <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106"
                                facs="0186"/>yesterday. The British, Japanese, French, and Italians
                            have given their assent to that method and it now appears as though the
                            situation of closing in a friendly spirit was well in hand. We have a
                            rough draft of proposed treaty completed and we are informed that the
                            British have another partially completed. As matters now stand, I
                            believe the Conference could adjourn with a fair degree of promptness,
                            possibly before April 22, but owing to the final delays which are
                            inevitable I advise against making any prophecy.</p>

                        <p>212. This morning we reached an agreement with the British and the
                            Japanese; we are now endeavoring to arrive at an agreement with the

                        <p>127. In arguments before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee it has
                            been contended by some of the “big Navy” opponents of the treaty, who
                            thereby seek to confuse and discredit the treaty, that construction
                            might be placed on article 19, second sentence, so as to permit
                            replacements of tonnage in 6-inch cruisers with the same amount of
                            tonnage in 8-inch cruisers or vice versa by any of the three parties.
                            Since the word “replacement” necessarily implies the substitution of the
                            same amount of tonnage in the same kind of ships, we believe there is no
                            basis for such contention. We consider, moreover, that this contention
                            is directly contrary to the fair implications of the provision for
                            transfer included in article 17, and also directly disregards division
                            of cruisers into two sub-categories made by articles 15 and 16. We are
                            anxious, nevertheless, that the treaty’s enemies in the Senate may be
                            given no possible excuse. Approach should be made therefore to the
                            appropriate British authorities to inquire whether an exchange of notes
                            on the following terms would be consented to:<note n="27"

                            this matter with the Government of the Free State to see whether some
                            means might not be discovered to bring about ratification immediately.
                            If this cannot be done, this Government is suggesting that a ceremony be
                            held at the time of the deposit of the Japanese and American
                            ratifications, since the President feels it important that the world
                            should know, prior to the meeting of the Preparatory Commission, what
                            has been actually accomplished in one phase of disarmament.</p>

                        <p>42. From Italian sources in the League Council, I learn that the British
                            Prime Minister recently wrote to Grandi<note n="37" xml:id="d114fn37"
                                >Dino Grandi, Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> asking
                            information concerning the reasons for the Italian naval construction
                            program announced by that Government after London Conference<note
                                n="37a" xml:id="d114fn37a">For correspondence relating to the London
                                Naval Conference of 1930, see <ref target="#pg_1">pp. 1</ref>
                                ff.</note> and expressing his apprehension regarding its
                            magnitude.</p>
                        <p>In explanation, Grandi replied that the countries participating in the
                            London Conference knew what Italy’s intentions were; namely, to build on
                            same scale as France; and that the program announced for 1930 and 1931
                            by Italy merely equaled the French program for the same period. Grandi
                            added that the Royal Government was ready to retard building, reduce
                            building, or stop building on its program while the two Governments were
                            engaged in an effort to solve the difficulties arising from their naval
                            programs to the same extent that the French Government would retard,
                            reduce, or stop its program during that period. According to what I was
                            told, Mac-Donald expressed his satisfaction with the Italian proposal,
                            but whether the proposal has yet reached French sources is not
                            known.</p>

                        <p>281. The conversations which have been going on between Massigli and
                            Rosso have now terminated, and yesterday Massigli left for Geneva. I
                            learned that there was nothing definite accomplished as it was found
                            impossible to surmount above all the essential obstacle presented,
                            namely, Italy’s insistence upon parity and France’s inability to concede
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The respective Governments gave carte blanche to Massigli and Rosso to
                            talk freely and on a purely personal basis without fear of committing
                            their Governments with a view to discovering, if possible, some formula
                            whereby each, so to speak, would “save face”. No such double-sided
                            formula, however, has thus far appeared in the discussions and while it
                            is still hoped that the conversations may possibly solve the difficulty,
                            there is little optimism that much progress can be made either along
                            this line or with regard to military or air questions, which both France
                            and Italy assert to be intimately bound up with the naval.</p>

                            of a unit of the same class [of] cruiser constructed by it since 1924,
                            that Government will advise the other of its intention one year in
                            advance and the other will have the right of denunciation.”</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] This French proposal is regarded by the Italians as a
                            retrogression and they are, or purport to be, full of disillusionment.
                            They call attention to the 6-inch-gun cruiser of approximately 7,800
                            tons which the French have built since 1924, whereas their maximum has
                            been 4,400 tons. Estimating construction between present date and 1936
                            on basis of the maximum unit permitted under French proposal, France
                            would have superiority in tonnage of approximately 3 to 2 in the
                            6-inch-gun class, whereas at present there is a practical equality.</p>
                        <p>The French offer was, nevertheless, transmitted to Grandi, who replied
                            with an abrupt order to end the discussions; and Rosso so notified
                            Massigli. Later on, Briand<note n="40c" xml:id="d117fn40c">Aristide

                                Scialoja<note n="41" xml:id="d117fn41">Vittorio Scialoja, Italian

                            and persuaded him to agree that both parties should state that the
                            conversations had been temporarily interrupted.</p>
                        <p>The situation is now completely the reverse of that which existed ten
                            days ago. The French are in some degree optimistic, and indicate that
                            they have made a very generous offer, also hinting that there will be an
                            immediate resumption of conversations. The mood of the Italians is the
                            exact opposite.</p>
                        <p>It appears unlikely that any improvement in the situation is to be hoped
                            for during present session of the Assembly. Massigli is going on a
                            vacation very shortly, and unless the conversations are resumed soon by
                            reponsible Cabinet officers the appearances are that we shall enter the
                            Preparatory Commission with this irritating point still unsettled. [End

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report as follows on
                            that portion of a conversation which I had last evening with the
                            President of the Council dealing with naval disarmament, particularly
                            from the Franco-Italian angle.</p>
                        <p>I told M. Tardieu that I was returning to the United States on a visit
                            and that I would like to be in a position to inform you and the
                            President, knowing how great your interest was in the matter, of the
                            present status of the Franco-Italian negotiations regarding naval
                            disarmament.</p>
                        <p>M. Tardieu answered that at Geneva, as I had perhaps heard, a new
                            proposition had been made by the French representatives, based on a five
                            years program, but that this proposal had been rejected by the Italians
                            who have always in the final analysis continued to insist upon parity
                            with France. (He apparently had reference to the proposal of Massigli,
                            set forth in Mr. Hugh Wilson’s telegram from Berne to the Department No.
                            87, September 26, 5 P.M.) M. Tardieu said that he himself was somewhat
                            relieved that the negotiations had broken down on the basis of this
                            offer as he was convinced that the French Parliament would not have
                            agreed to the proposal as a basis for settlement. In any case, the
                            Italians had turned it down and now the situation was perhaps even less
                            favorable than it had been at London. M. Tardieu then went on to discuss
                            the general question. He said that he felt that the position of no
                            country on any question could be clearer and more unassailable than
                            France’s position on the question of naval disarmament. All she asked
                            was a navy sufficient to protect her communications with her outlying
                            colonies, dispersed as they were over all parts of the globe. The United
                            States and Great Britain were at liberty, so far as France was
                            concerned, to build as many thousand tons as they desired, but he did
                            not see why the mere fact of the United States and Great Britain having
                            agreed between themselves upon a certain maximum tonnage should serve as
                            a basis for establishing an arbitrary figure as representing the needs
                            of France. He was afraid that, as a result of the Washington
                            Conference,—he did not wish to criticize the handling of France’s case
                            there as that was a thing of the past,—the impression seemed to be
                            general that France was willing to accept parity with Italy. This was
                            most emphatically not the case. France could not accept parity with
                            Italy and every unprejudiced student of the question with whom he had
                            spoken was in agreement. He mentioned the British Prime Minister, Mr.
                            MacDonald, yourself, Mr. Morrow, Mr. Gibson and <pb n="136"
                                xml:id="pg_136" facs="0216"/>others with whom he had spoken. But, he
                            added, no one of the American or British delegates at London seemed to
                            be willing, in the final analysis, to put it up squarely to the
                            Italians: in other words, to bring pressure to bear on Italy to recede
                            from the impossible position she had taken. He said that during the
                            Conference, on one of the occasions when he had been forced to return to
                            Paris, the British Ambassador had paid him a hurried visit and had
                            insisted upon his returning to London as they had everything prepared
                            for an agreement: that the American and British delegates were prepared
                            to tell the Italians that they would have to accept reasonable terms and
                            no longer insist upon parity with France. As a result of this, M.
                            Tardieu had gone to London, spent a day at Chequers, but had found that
                            no such pressure was to be brought to bear upon the Italians, as he had
                            been led to believe, through the representatives of Great Britain and
                            the United States at Rome.<note n="44" xml:id="d118fn44">See telegram
                                No. 156, March 23, 9 p.m., from the chairman of the American
                                delegation, <ref target="#pg_75">p. 75</ref>.</note> He said that
                            you had intimated to him that the British message, as transmitted to him
                            through Lord Tyrrell, had been sent without your knowledge or
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>M. Tardieu then went on to speak of the general situation of chaos that
                            existed in Europe to-day. He said that France and Czechoslovakia were
                            the only two countries that seemed to be weathering the storm; that they
                            were oases in the desert. All of which would seem to justify the French
                            Government in continuing with the policy which it had been pursuing. He
                            said that in the forty years during which he had been a student and
                            observer of international affairs he had never seen such a state of
                            moral decomposition as existed in Europe today. So far as reaching an
                            understanding with Italy was concerned, he reiterated that there was
                            nothing that he desired more: that one had only to study the present
                            situation in Europe to realize how important it was from France’s point
                            of view to reach such an agreement, but that it could not be
                            accomplished at such a sacrifice as Italy demanded.</p>
                        <p>I did not attempt to argue with him, merely explaining that I had raised
                            the question with the sole idea of being in a position to report the
                            latest developments.</p>

                        <p>324. The following information from an official source believed to be
                            accurate has been obtained by the Acting Military Attaché.</p>
                        <p>The plans of the Ministry of Marine for the French naval program for 1931
                            are completed and have been approved by Tardieu and by the Ministry of
                            Finance.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Violette, the author of the program, is a close personal friend
                            of both Herriot and Painlevé, and our information includes statement
                            that the plan has approval of these two leaders of the Left, in event
                            that an agreement with Italy is not obtained. Briand is now considering
                            these plans, and they will be put into effect unless there is an Italian
                            agreement, which seems impossible at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The proposed French naval plan is based on necessity of insuring
                            unquestioned control of the western end of the Mediterranean and
                            provides for construction of 50,000 tons of new ships in 1931. The keel
                            of one 10,000-ton 8-inch cruiser will be laid on December 1, 1930, and
                            on April 1, 1931, construction will start on the first of three
                            22,000-ton capital ships. These ships are within the 1.75 ratio allowed
                            France by Washington Treaty, and will mount 13-inch guns and have a
                            speed of 28 to 30 knots.</p>
                        <p>As a bid for British neutrality, the submarine construction will be
                            reduced except in the 600–ton coast defense class.</p>

                            />make representations for the purpose of preserving the levels set down
                            in that treaty from any disturbance arising from a failure on the part
                            of France and Italy to come to some agreement.</p>
                        <p>In addition to imminence of publishing the French program for 1931, an
                            action which would tend to aggravate the situation, it is felt to be
                            important that France and Italy shall not come to the session of the
                            Preparatory Commission set for November 6 in Geneva and there embark
                            upon naval discussions calculated to complicate the situation still
                            further.</p>
                        <p>Campbell is cabling to his Government the details of the conversation,
                            the point of which is that the three powers should make the suggestion
                            to France and Italy through all available channels that they abandon
                            efforts to win diplomatic victories, each over the other, with respect
                            to naval parity and defer that issue until 1936, in the meantime issuing
                            unilateral declarations setting forth their respective naval programs.
                            The terms of these declarations, naturally, would have to be worked out
                            together beforehand, and they would constitute, presumably, a retarding
                            or postponement of their building programs in such a way as not to risk
                            bringing into play article 21 of the Naval Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary will emphasize to the French and Italian Ambassadors that
                            their mutual attitude on naval armaments will not increase security; in
                            particular, that a heavy increase over present establishments on the
                            part of France which would necessitate any change in the London Treaty
                            levels, would tend to alienate sympathy not only in Great Britain but in
                            the United States as well, and presumably in Japan. The Government of
                            the United States does not desire to be alone in its efforts as it feels
                            that maximum influence can be exercised on France and Italy only after
                            each realizes that the question is one which is of genuine world
                            interest, not of interest to any one country alone.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is for your information and your guidance should the matter
                            be broached to you in London.</p>

                        <p>190. Yesterday I had a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador which
                            was based on conferences with the President and our delegates <pb
                                n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0219"/>to the Preparatory
                                Commission.<note n="47" xml:id="d121fn47">Hugh S. Gibson, Ambassador
                                to Belgium, and Hugh R. Wilson, Minister to Switzerland. See <ref
                                    target="#pg_187">pp. 187</ref> ff.</note> I summarize the
                            conversation as follows, for your information:</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that the failure of France and Italy to make any
                            progress in their naval negotiations troubled me. If progress were not
                            made before the meeting of the Preparatory Commission, I felt that the
                            likelihood would be very great that something would be said or done at
                            the forthcoming session of the Commission which afterward would make a
                            solution of the issue between the two countries more difficult or
                            impossible. I feared that something might be said at any moment,
                            furthermore, particularly on the part of France, which might make the
                            granting of any concession more difficult for her.</p>
                        <p>What was required on France’s part, I pointed out, was reduction in her
                            naval program to which she had adhered continuously since 1924; and that
                            what was required on the part of Italy was that she should refrain from
                            insisting upon diplomatic victory for a theoretical parity to which she
                            did not intend to build. Such a deadlock, it seemed to me, ought to be
                            comparatively simple of solution. If France continued to insist rigidly
                            upon her 1924 naval program, she would make it almost certain that Great
                            Britain would have to invoke the so-called “escalator” clause in the
                            London Naval Treaty and increase the British fleet; this action on
                            Britain’s part would make it probable that we and the Japanese should
                            have to do likewise. It seemed to me that France would be taking a very
                            grave responsibility if, at a time when all the rest of us were cutting
                            down our navies, she would go ahead and build up a navy to such an
                            extent that she would force the breaking of the Naval Treaty. I could
                            not believe that France would wish to run the risk of such adverse world
                            opinion as this course on her part would be sure to arouse.</p>
                        <p>As for the Italians, they admitted frankly that they did not wish to
                            build up to a theoretical parity with France. The difficulty ought
                            easily to be solved, therefore, by a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                Vivendi</hi> until 1936. I told Mr. Debuchi that my suggestion would
                            be that the two Powers in question should agree not to agree on theory,
                            but that each should make a unilateral announcement of a reasonable
                            program of naval construction until 1936, all questions of mutual parity
                            or of superiority being reserved until after 1936.</p>
                        <p>Debuchi repeated my propositions after me carefully. He asked me whether
                            it was our intention to go ahead by ourselves or to await an answer from
                            Japan. I told the Ambassador that I was not seeking to force any joint
                            action, but that in view of the pressure of time I felt that I should go
                            ahead in the very near future; and I hoped that <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0220"/>if Baron Shidehara<note n="48"

                            agreed with me in my views he might do something of the same sort.</p>
                        <p>I told Debuchi that I was sending a similar message to the British
                            Ambassador, and that I hoped to talk with the French and the Italian
                            Ambassadors in the very near future. Debuchi thanked me for my action in
                            notifying Japan, and said that he would communicate with his
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>260. This morning I had a long conversation with the French Ambassador
                            which followed these lines:</p>
                        <p>I told Claudel that, with the date of the meeting of the Preparatory
                            Commission set for November 6, the urgency became greater that some
                            arrangement should be reached between France and Italy on the naval
                            questions between them, lest inflammatory speeches be made at the
                            forthcoming session.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to him that if France and Italy should make no settlement,
                            the British almost certainly would have to invoke the escalator clause
                            of the Naval Treaty, a step which would have a profound effect on world
                            public opinion and would discredit all efforts to reduce naval armament.
                            The blame for any such alterations, furthermore, naturally would fall
                            upon France and Italy.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I felt that it was my duty to point out to him
                            and to the Italian Ambassador as well that, without entering into a
                            binding treaty, it might be possible for each country to make a
                            unilateral declaration of a reasonable and nonprovocative program of
                            naval construction up to 1936, reserving until that date, with full
                            liberty of action, the theoretical questions which had brought about a
                            deadlock.</p>
                        <p>I let Claudel know that this country, in the Preparatory Commission, had
                            never put impediments in the way of the land defenses of France, as it
                            was recognized that France’s chief danger had always been from the land.
                            In the case of the French naval program, however, the man in the streets
                            might take the view that that was an element of provocation.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador to consider whether France, in reality, were not
                            reducing her security through the effect that increases in <pb n="141"
                                xml:id="pg_141" facs="0221"/>her Navy would produce upon her
                            neighbors and friends, Great Britain especially.</p>
                        <p>Claudel was not encouraging in his replies but he promised to communicate
                            the entire conversation to his Government.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I talked along similar lines with the Italian Ambassador, and
                            today I had conversations with the British and the Japanese Ambassadors,
                            urging that they join in representations of the character indicated, in
                            the hope that concerted action of this sort would bring about some
                            result.</p>

                        <p>91. This morning I had a conversation with the Italian Ambassador in
                            which I told him that if the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament
                            Conference should meet on November 6 without an agreement having been
                            reached previously between Italy and France on the naval question, the
                            situation as it is now might be inflamed and a subsequent agreement
                            would be made more difficult. In all probability Great Britain would
                            invoke, in that case, the escalator clause in the Naval Treaty, thus
                            making necessary a change in the levels of naval armaments by the three
                            powers which had already ratified the treaty.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had decided to make a final appeal to France
                            and Italy that they try to reach some provisional agreement at once, and
                            that I had communicated my intention of taking this step to the British
                            and the Japanese Governments, who, no doubt, will make similar
                            representations. I referred to a previous conversation I had had with
                            him in which I had suggested that the possible solution of the problem
                            might be, instead of a binding treaty between the two countries, a
                            unilateral declaration by each announcing a reasonable, nonprovocative
                            program of naval construction until 1936, reserving until that date the
                            decisions on the theoretical questions still at issue.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had talked with the French Ambassador, and
                            that I had said to Claudel, as I now said to him, that the security of
                            the two powers was not being increased but on the contrary was being
                            decreased by adding to their existing naval armaments.</p>

                        <p>334. This morning the Counselor of the British Embassy here called to say
                            that the Embassy had received from London a copy of the telegram which
                                Lindsay<note n="51" xml:id="d125fn51">Sir Ronald Lindsay, British
                                Ambassador in the United States.</note> had sent from Washington to
                            the Foreign Office stating that you had taken up with the Embassy the
                            rumored naval construction program of the French Government as it had
                            been reported to you by us; and that you had made the suggestion that
                            the British and Japanese Governments join with the American Government
                            in an endeavor to persuade the Governments of France and Italy to come
                            to an agreement on naval disarmament.</p>
                        <p>The Counselor said that you had hoped to receive a reply from London
                            before Gibson sailed for Europe, but that the British Foreign Office had
                            wished first to consult the Japanese Government but had found this
                            impossible. The Counselor asked whether, in the meantime, I could give
                            him the source of our information on the French naval program regarding
                            which the British apparently had no information.</p>
                        <p>I said that we had received our information from a source which we deemed
                            reliable and pointed out that in the issue of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Figaro</hi> for October 18 an article appeared by Thomazi, the
                            journal’s naval expert, who is himself a reserve officer of the Marine,
                            and is in close <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0223"/>touch with the
                            French Ministry of Marine; and that this article contained substantially
                            the same information as that which had been set forth in our telegram to
                            you four days before the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>
                            article referred to.</p>
                        <p>The Counselor and I agreed that we should both try to obtain official
                            confirmation of the reported French program, using the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Figaro</hi> article as a basis. As I am endeavoring to arrange for
                            Gibson the interviews with Tardieu and Briand which you requested, I am
                            particularly anxious to have something definite for him when he arrives
                            four days from now.</p>
                        <p>Referring again to your No. 260, October 16, 6 p.m., I would draw your
                            attention particularly to a conversation between the Ambassador and
                            Tardieu just before the former left Paris and reported by him in the
                            Embassy’s despatch No. 927, October 8. The despatch should have reached
                            you by this date. See also our telegram No. 325, October 14, 9 p.m.<note

                        <p>337. Embassy’s No. 334, October 20, 6 p.m. I have seen the Counselor of
                            the British Embassy again and he tells me that yesterday the British
                            Naval Attaché made inquiries at the Ministry of Marine, using the <hi
                                rend="italic">Figaro</hi> article as the basis for his inquiry. He
                            was told <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0224"/>that while there had
                            been some discussion inside the Ministry itself along the lines set
                            forth in the article and in the Embassy’s telegram No. 324, October 14,
                            5 p.m., and while the question may even have been brought up before the
                            Supreme Defense Council with a view to deciding how the funds allocated
                            to the Navy under the budget should be spent, the entire matter is far
                            from being in definite shape.</p>
                        <p>The important point, the Counselor said, seemed to be that in any event
                            the French had no intention for the present of making a public
                            announcement in regard to any building program the effect of which might
                            be unfortunate, particularly just before the meeting of the Preparatory
                            Commission. He also said that another member of the staff of the British
                            Embassy had called on Massigli in connection with the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Figaro</hi> article, and that Massigli had confirmed, more or less,
                            what had been obtained from the Ministry of Marine. In accordance with
                            instructions from the British Foreign Office, which were to determine
                            the accuracy of the report, the results of the investigations described
                            above had been sent to London.</p>
                        <p>I gathered that the Embassy’s report to the Foreign Office included a
                            very emphatic expression of my opinion, et cetera, that representations
                            by the three Powers (United States, Great Britain and Japan) to the
                            French in the present mood of the latter would be of little avail unless
                            some new formula could be devised by which parity would be avoided and
                            which would at the same time offer some basis for discussion: That,
                            after all, they had failed at London and no more reason existed now to
                            suppose that they would be more successful at the present time unless
                            some such formula could be devised, as the French were just as decided
                            as ever not to grant parity to Italy.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to share the Counselor’s opinion. In a conversation I had
                            yesterday with Léger<note n="53" xml:id="d127fn53">Alexis Léger,
                                Director of Political and Commercial Affairs, French Ministry for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> he referred to the decision taken recently
                            at the Fascist Grand Council<note n="54" xml:id="d127fn54">On October 7,
                                the Grand Council pronounced approval of the report of the Italian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs relative to the recent
                                (August–September) naval negotiations with France.</note> not to
                            negotiate with France along any other line except parity. His remarks
                            were similar to those expressed by Tardieu to the American Ambassador as
                            reported in Embassy’s despatch No. 927, October 8.</p>
                        <p>Massigli telephoned me this evening to come over to see him. He told me
                            that the Foreign Office had received a telegram from Claudel which
                            indicated that you were in some measure perturbed over a report
                            regarding a proposed French program of naval construction. I called his

                        <p>268. Department’s No. 258, October 15, 6 p.m. This afternoon the British
                            Ambassador handed me copy of a telegram from the Foreign Office, dated
                            October 22, 1930,<note n="56" xml:id="d128fn56">Not printed.</note>
                            which concludes with the statement that, in the circumstances, they fear
                            that anything in the nature of joint representations at the present
                            moment might do more harm than good.</p>
                        <p>Our suggestion was not for joint representations; we clearly informed the
                            Embassy here that in all events we were proceeding to express our own
                            views to France and Italy, but that we hoped that the British Government
                            would realize the gravity of the situation as we view it, and on its own
                            initiative would proceed to express its views while there is still time
                            to preserve the levels set by the London Naval Treaty. Both the
                            President and I feel keen disappointment at the British attitude. The
                            communication we have received suggests that the rumors which have come
                            to our ears to the effect that the French are on verge of announcing an
                            extremely disappointing naval building program for 1931–1932 are
                            unfounded, and also suggests that there is hope that the French will
                            propose conciliatory steps during the Preparatory Commission conference.
                            This optimism is not in the least corroborated by any of our
                            information. On the contrary, our fears are strengthened by our
                            conversations with both the French and the Italian Ambassadors, and we
                            believe that the only hope of saving the French-Italian negotiations
                            before they are crystallized in failure lies in the influence of a
                            clearly expressed outside public opinion.</p>
                        <p>I should like to have you see the Prime Minister personally and discuss
                            the foregoing with him, expressing the disappointment of <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0226"/>this Government. You might also suggest
                            to him that it might be possible for someone, Craigie perhaps, to get in
                            touch with Gibson when he arrives tomorrow in Paris.</p>

                        <p>270. Your No. 337, October 22, 3 p.m. The primary interest of the
                            American Government is not whether the French naval building program is
                            what is announced in <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>, or elsewhere; it is
                            solely whether or not the building program of the French Government is
                            of such size and character as to threaten the stability in the naval
                            levels set by the London Treaty.</p>
                        <p>While an exact formula for figures is not being suggested, the American
                            Government has pointed out, and it has been informed that the Government
                            of Japan will do likewise, the advisability of permitting the issue to
                            be postponed during the lifetime of the present treaty. The interests of
                            both France and Italy might be fully safeguarded, it would seem, by a
                            unilateral statement by France to the effect that while the London
                            Treaty remains in force, that is up to 1936, her building program could
                            be reduced materially, subject, of course, to a similar and satisfactory
                            unilateral declaration by Italy.</p>
                        <p>Similar representations accompanied by suggestion of the same formula of
                            a unilateral declaration have been made to Italian Government together
                            with suggestion that whole question of naval parity be postponed until
                            1936. The entire matter has been discussed with Claudel, and it has been
                            pointed out, furthermore, that France was not in any way adding to her
                            security by insisting on high levels in naval armament and by prolonging
                            unduly the period of uncertainty on this subject through failing either
                            to come to an agreement with Italy or to act simultaneously with that
                            power along independent lines.</p>
                        <p>It is my belief that Claudel has not got across the true gist of my
                            conversation with him on the subject; Gibson should be very careful,
                            therefore, to emphasize every point as if the French Government had no
                            previous knowledge of the subject he wishes to take up.</p>

                        <p>98. I am told by the Japanese Chargé here that he saw Grandi yesterday
                            evening, and acting under instruction from his Government asked the
                            Minister whether he had any information regarding a rumor that the
                            French Government intended to announce a capital ship construction
                            program, a rumor which, in the Chargé’s belief, was communicated to the
                            Japanese Government by its Ambassador at Washington following a
                            conference with the Secretary of State on October 15. Grandi told the
                            Japanese Chargé that he had no such information.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Chargé then expressed the general interest that his
                            Government felt in the consummation of a French-Italian naval agreement,
                            and more specifically the concern of the Japanese Government that the
                            failure of France and Italy to reach an agreement might lead Great
                            Britain to invoke article 21 of the London Naval Treaty; in which event,
                            the Government of Japan could not remain indifferent.</p>
                        <p>There was no intimation that the Chargé’s representations were based on
                            anything except the Japanese Government’s own initiative. Grandi
                            accorded a most agreeable reception to what the Chargé said. The
                            Japanese Ambassador in Paris was sent identical instructions; he has
                            notified his Government that he is holding back action on them until he
                            has seen Gibson tomorrow in Paris. Gibson has been informed.</p>

                        <p>339. From Gibson and Wilson. It seems to be clear that British, French,
                            and Japanese Governments have, at best, misunderstood your suggestion in
                            that all of them have taken it to be in the nature of a protest to
                            France against the completion of the French naval building program for
                            1931, as it was sketched in this Embassy’s telegram No. 324, October 14,
                            5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>We called this morning on the British Ambassador, who had received
                            instructions to investigate truth of report regarding the 1931 program
                            with a view to making representations protesting it, but who had raised
                            vigorous objection on the ground that to do this would do more harm than
                            good. We explained to the Ambassador that the reference to the 1931
                            building program of France in the conversations which took place in
                            Washington was not a determining factor but was merely an additional
                            reason why it would be well that any action contemplated should be taken
                            before existing situation was aggravated either by the discussion at the
                            session of the Preparatory Commission or by the announcement by France
                            of a building program which might no longer leave that Government in
                            position of a free agent in deciding its future course.</p>
                        <p>We went on to explain that the possibility of such an announcement had
                            come to your attention only after you had come to a decision on your
                            general plan. We then outlined fully to the Ambassador the nature of my
                            statement made in conversation with Tardieu.</p>
                        <p>Tyrrell said that this gave an entirely different aspect to the whole
                            matter; that he felt that it was a wise course to pursue; and, to my
                            astonishment, he seemed to feel that there was considerable chance of
                            Tardieu’s receiving it favorably. In this connection, Tyrrell suggested
                            laying stress on two points: (1) That we were not questioning France’s
                            right to build within the limits of the Treaty of Washington, and were
                            confining our suggestion to auxiliary craft, thus meeting the needs of
                            the British as far as MacDonald was concerned; and (2) that we propose
                            to urge the Italian Government to postpone effort to obtain a diplomatic
                            victory on the question of naval parity.</p>
                        <p>Tyrrell said that the Japanese Ambassador had come to call on him, and,
                            although not very communicative, had given him to understand that he had
                            received instructions from Tokyo similar to those which Tyrrell has
                            received from London; that the Ambassador had <pb n="149"
                                xml:id="pg_149" facs="0229"/>questioned the wisdom of acting upon
                            them and had notified Tokyo of his views. Fortunately both Ambassadors
                            had put off taking action until the situation had been clarified.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador said that a message from London had been received
                            this morning stating that by evening he will probably receive a
                            communication which he is to make to the French Government. We assume
                            that he will inform his Government of substance of our conversation with
                            him and will express himself satisfied as to wisdom of the course
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>Next we called on the Japanese Ambassador. It was evident that he was not
                            at all familiar with the subject, and from the very meager instructions
                            he had evidently received from the Japanese Foreign Office he had been
                            unable to obtain any clear view of the situation.</p>
                        <p>We explained the matter fully to him. He asked us many questions, finally
                            making a memorandum of the several points embodying a clear
                            understanding of what our aims are. Then he said that he would present
                            the matter along lines similar to our own, although I think that his
                            statement will be more of a formal communication than an informal
                            discussion of the problem. We believe that the matter has now been
                            clarified satisfactorily with both the British and the Japanese
                            Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>Gibson goes to Brussels this afternoon so as to stop possible conjectures
                            on the part of the press as to the reason for his continuing to stay in
                            Paris. He will return here on Monday morning as he has an appointment to
                            see Tardieu in the afternoon at 5 o’clock; this date is the earliest
                            opportunity offered, as the Premier is fully occupied today in receiving
                            the French aviators, Coste and Bellonte; and Briand is ill. Gibson will
                            leave for Rome on Tuesday afternoon. Wilson will remain in Paris at
                            least until Gibson has left.</p>

                            <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have been much
                                concerned at rumours which continue to reach them in regard to a
                                Franco-Italian deadlock in naval question. Assurances were given to
                                Mr. Henderson at Geneva that conversations which had been suspended
                                would be continued but up to the present nothing in this direction
                                appears to have occurred. His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope
                                that the negotiations which at one time seemed to be progressing
                                favourably may be resumed in some form at earliest possible moment.
                                Prime Minister as chairman of naval conference offered his good
                                offices when conference adjourned and Mr. Henderson made same offer
                                to M. Briand and Signor Grandi in May last. The good offices of His
                                Majesty’s Government as party closely concerned in every aspect of
                                this question remain open to the two Governments should they desire
                                to make use of them.</p>

                        <p>100. I have been told by the British Ambassador that he received
                            instructions this morning to represent to the Italian Government the
                            great interest of Great Britain in the reaching of a naval accord
                            between Italy and France and to tender the good offices of the British
                            Government to that end.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador added that his Government appeared to be reluctant to take
                            this step, but feels that in view of your suggestions it cannot fail to
                            do so. He is instructed to make his representations today so that they
                            may precede the exchange of treaty ratifications tomorrow in

                        <p>The Italian Ambassador came to see me to read a telegram from his
                            Government of comment on the conversations he had with the Secretary on
                            the subject of French-Italian naval building.</p>
                        <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>Mussolini pointed out in the telegram that, in the last conversation with
                            France, Italy took the initiative in presenting compromise proposals.
                            Italy was perfectly willing to make compromises, but France was not
                            willing to make any at all. No Italian concessions were matched by any
                            French concessions.</p>
                        <p>I had told the Ambassador one day that it would be rather wonderful if
                            Italy would have the courage to act alone and make an announcement that
                            they had no intention of building before the next conference. I said
                            that, if Italy would do a thing of this sort, it would gain the sympathy
                            of the entire world and that France would practically be forced by
                            public opinion to cut down its own program. Apparently the Ambassador
                            had telegraphed this conversation also to Rome because the telegram he
                            had pointed out, specifically referring to what I had said, that this
                            practically was the Italian proposal of last May,<note n="62"
                                xml:id="d135fn62">See telegram No. 42, May 16, 3 p.m., from the

                            although, of course, the naval holiday was presupposed to be on the part
                            of both countries. Mussolini feels that a onesided declaration of this
                            kind might be altogether too dangerous because there was no proof that
                            France would not gayly continue its building program.</p>

                        <p>340. From Gibson and Wilson. The British Ambassador has informed Wilson
                            that on Sunday morning, acting under instructions from his Government,
                            he called on the Foreign Office and made the statement that the British
                            Government viewed with concern the apparent check in the French-Italian
                            naval conversations; that Mr. Mac-Donald in the London Conference, and
                            Mr. Henderson at a later date, had already offered any possible British
                            assistance in solution of the difficulty; that the British Government
                            had now instructed him (the Ambassador) to reiterate that Great
                            Britain’s offer of assistance for mediation or other purposes was still
                            open at any time that the disputing powers chose to avail themselves of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office official to whom Tyrrell was speaking replied that
                            Massigli had taken the latest step in the discussions by the offer he
                            made at Geneva; the Italians had not yet replied to it, although they
                            had stated that the negotiations were still open; that Fascist Grand
                            Council had subsequently adopted a resolution calling for <pb n="152"
                                xml:id="pg_152" facs="0232"/>parity, and that under these
                            circumstances the first step toward resumption of negotiations must come
                            from Italy and that it could lead to something only if they relaxed
                            their attitude with regard to parity.</p>
                        <p>Gibson is to see Tardieu at 5 o’clock. Embassy at Rome informed.</p>

                        <p>277. My No. 271, October 24, 6 p.m. Henderson told me that the British
                            Embassy at Washington was instructed to show you the cable sent to the
                            British Ambassador there reversing the position outlined in your
                            telegram No. 268, October 23, 8 p.m. The cable was shown to me but I
                            shall not repeat it as it is in your possession. I was also informed
                            that instructions were issued immediately to the British Ambassadors at
                            Rome and at Paris to carry out your suggestions, and that this morning
                            the Foreign Office had received cables stating that the respective
                            Ambassadors had made representations yesterday to the Italian and the
                            French Governments. Grandi was away from Rome on Sunday, but a written
                            statement was left at his office. I assume that this information will
                            reach you through the British Ambassador. I have telegraphed to our
                            Embassy at Paris requesting that the substance of the foregoing be
                            conveyed to Wilson and Gibson. Craigie feels that, as things are, there
                            will be no occasion for him to consult with Gibson in Paris.</p>

                        <p>278. For Gibson. On Saturday morning the French Ambassador brought me a
                            memorandum from his Government on the French naval program and the
                            French-Italian difficulties.<note n="63" xml:id="d138fn63">Not
                                printed.</note> The most significant passage stated that the French
                            Government was still striving to reach a friendly agreement with Italy
                            with regard to the limitation of the <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153"
                                facs="0233"/>categories of warships not provided for in the
                            Washington Treaty; that, however, such an agreement could not be
                            effected on terms which would imply the superiority on the Mediterranean
                            of the Italian fleet over the French fleet, the latter being required
                            for the protection, on other seas and within the French colonies, of
                            interests which do not fall to the care of the Italian Navy.</p>
                        <p>Claudel asked me, before I had time to read the memorandum, what kind of
                            a compromise between France and Italy I would recommend. I said that of
                            course I could not make any recommendation on figures; that they were a
                            matter for negotiation between the two countries. I again made clear to
                            him that my suggestion was that Italy should lay aside until 1936 her
                            technical insistence on parity and that France should, in the meantime,
                            abandon her insistence upon the exact figures of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >loi navale</hi> between now and 1936. I told him that I thought if
                            this could be done, a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> on
                            construction in the meantime could be arranged and announced to the
                            world in unilateral declarations. I likewise let him know that it seemed
                            to us that Italy had thus far displayed a more conciliatory disposition
                            than France. Claudel inquired whether or not the building of any of the
                            reserve tonnage in the battleship category would adversely affect the
                            situation; I told him that I realized that this right had been reserved
                            to France in the London Naval Treaty.</p>

                        <p>341. From Gibson. I called on Tardieu with Armour at 5 o’clock this
                            afternoon. We found him in a very irritated state of mind, obviously
                            caused by Claudel’s failure to understand the character and the real
                            purpose of your original proposal. As a matter of fact, Tardieu
                            manifestly in no way realized that a definite proposal for a solution of
                            the problem had been made by the Italian Government. In introducing my
                            statement I said that I had a rather long communication to make to him
                            and that I hoped he would hear me through to the end before giving me
                            his comment, in order that my message might be delivered clearly and
                            accurately. Tardieu agreed to this and made a successful effort not to
                            interrupt during the following quarter of an hour.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>At the end of my statement<note n="65" xml:id="d139fn65">See telegram No.
                                344, October 28, 4 p.m., from the Chargé in France, <ref
                                    target="#pg_156">p. 156</ref>.</note> he said that some of the
                            objections he had intended to raise had already been anticipated by me
                            and that it had been his feeling that by this method nothing could be
                            accomplished; he said the suggestion for unilateral declarations had
                            been put forward by him very early in the London Conference but had been
                            turned down by Henderson as negligible. The French Government, he
                            continued, had repeatedly suggested this method but it had never been
                            given favorable consideration. He felt, moreover, that the resolution of
                            the Fascist Grand Council to the effect that no further negotiations
                            would be undertaken until their claim to parity had been accepted, had
                            blocked all hope of agreement effectively.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I pointed out how the proposed unilateral declarations would
                            avoid this difficulty and leave both Governments free, without any loss
                            of face, to announce restricted building programs, adding that I was
                            going to repeat to Grandi in Rome the substance of what you had told the
                            Italian Ambassador at Washington and to urge upon him that Italy defer
                            until 1936 the idea of a diplomatic victory on parity. When I had
                            explained this latter point to Tardieu in various ways, he at last
                            showed his first favorable reaction and stated that this method might
                            prove the means toward a solution.</p>
                        <p>On repeated occasions I expressly disclaimed any intention on our part to
                            mediate or to lay down the figures which France was to have, saying
                            that, up to the point where French construction might upset the London
                            Treaty levels, her building program was a matter of indifference to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>When he had heard all I had to say, Tardieu’s irritation vanished and by
                            successive stages he arrived at a point where he expressed definite
                            approval of the idea I had laid before him and voiced the belief that
                            the problem might be solved in this manner. Tardieu promised to give the
                            possibilities of the situation immediate study in order to be prepared
                            when he heard how Grandi received the suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Upon answering his question as to the opening date of the Preparatory
                            Commission meeting, I was surprised to find that he considered the
                            period up to November 6th left ample time for an agreement, provided
                            Italy reacted favorably. In explanation he said that the two Governments
                            had discussed figures exhaustively and that if agreement as to this
                            method of avoiding the parity problem were reached, they should be able
                            “within an hour” to come to a satisfactory understanding.</p>
                        <p>He also asked me to see Massigli and Berthelot<note n="66"

                            the next few days, Armour and I have requested Wilson to remain in Paris
                            at least until I can get in touch with him after seeing Grandi in
                            Rome.</p>

                        <p>342. From Gibson. Tardieu this afternoon in the course of our
                            conversation, and after some hesitation, said he felt he ought to tell
                            me, very confidentially, about one difficulty: The real obstacle to
                            naval agreement was, he said, to find levels which would satisfy the
                            British; as soon as these levels were found, it would be relatively easy
                            to come to terms with the Italians. He added that for several days
                            discussions with Great Britain had been under way and he hoped they
                            would be over shortly with a resultant material clarification in the
                            situation. Indeed, it was his suggestion that I remain in Paris until
                            the question had been settled but he subsequently agreed with me that I
                            had better go on to Rome and prepare the ground there.</p>
                        <p>It would seem from this that the British have already gone along our
                            lines about as far as they can while they themselves are engaged in
                            direct negotiations; for this reason you may feel that we cannot in the
                            immediate future ask them to do anything further.</p>
                        <p>Considering the present situation—which now seems adjusted as
                            satisfactorily as can be hoped for here—do you not think it would be
                            better to make any further communications through our Paris Embassy
                            rather than through Claudel in order that they may be coordinated with
                            the clear understanding now existing in Paris rather than show up any
                            further misunderstandings resulting from possible failure of Claudel to
                            understand the exact nature of your proposals.</p>

                        <p>343. From Gibson. The Japanese Ambassador, Yoshizawa, asked Wilson to
                            call this morning and told him that he had seen Berthelot <pb n="156"
                                xml:id="pg_156" facs="0236"/>last night and, in accordance with
                            instructions, had asked Berthelot whether the French-Italian naval
                            discussions were making any headway. Berthelot gave him a negative
                            reply, whereupon Yoshizawa stated that the Japanese Government felt
                            uneasy about the situation because good relations might be endangered by
                            failure to reach agreement and invocation of article 21 of the London
                            Treaty might be rendered unavoidable. Berthelot then stated that as long
                            as Italy insisted on parity he could see little hope. The Japanese
                            Ambassador inquired whether he could not envisage some means by which
                            the deadlock might be broken, to which Berthelot replied that in his
                            opinion the only way was for the United States, Great Britain, and Japan
                            to consult with France with a view to fixing a level in auxiliary craft
                            which would be satisfactory to parties of the London Treaty and to
                            France. The Italian problem would be much simpler, he added, if this
                            could be accomplished.</p>

                        <p>344. From Gibson. On account of the possibility that subsequent
                            discussions may bring up details of my interview with Tardieu, I think
                            it advisable to send you herewith, as a supplement to my telegram No.
                            341, October 27, the following full summary of my remarks to him, in the
                            form of a free translation from the French: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Inasmuch as I was going to Paris, the Secretary of State thought
                                    it desirable that I call on you and give you the substance of
                                    what he told M. Claudel on October 16, and also that I make use
                                    of the few days before the opening of the next meeting of the
                                    Disarmament Conference to call on Signor Grandi in order to give
                                    him the substance of Mr. Stimson’s conversation on the same day
                                    with the Italian Ambassador.</p>
                                <p>My message being rather long, I venture to begin by stating that
                                    it will lead up to a suggestion as to how a solution might be
                                    found of the Franco-Italian naval difficulty.</p>
                                <p>It is our conviction that there is a necessity for completing at
                                    its next meeting the work of the Preparatory Commission for the
                                    Disarmament Conference. If this session ends without completing
                                    its labors, we feel this completion will be indefinitely
                                    retarded, and a situation fraught with unpleasant possibilities
                                    will arise. It is my understanding that this view is shared by
                                    the French Government.</p>
                                <p>There seems to be no insuperable obstacle in dealing with the
                                    questions on the agenda, the naval question excepted. The
                                    Secretary of State, however, is worried by the thought that if
                                    the Preparatory <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0237"
                                    />Commission should meet without a prior solution of their naval
                                    controversy having been found by France and Italy, a distinct
                                    danger that the situation will be embittered as regards this and
                                    other problems will exist. The efforts largely under French
                                    guidance for finding a solution of the general disarmament
                                    problem have been followed with great interest by the United
                                    States Government, and Mr. Stimson’s friendly feelings prompted
                                    him to express his uneasiness at the present situation to M.
                                    Claudel.</p>
                                <p>French concern for security in any move toward disarmament is
                                    fully understood by the American Government. As you will
                                    remember, we recognized, in the course of the work of the
                                    Preparatory Commission, that the French thesis concerning land
                                    armaments resulted from this concern for security, and we have
                                    therefore deferred to the French conception in this matter even
                                    to the extent of giving up our insistence upon the necessity for
                                    limiting trained reserves—a concession which subjected our
                                    Government in the United States to severe criticism. I remind
                                    you of this merely to emphasize our genuine desire to meet the
                                    French conception of security and to fall in with this point of
                                    view as far as it is practically possible.</p>
                                <p>Considering this attitude of the American Government—which has
                                    been proven in practical form—I am convinced you will not take
                                    amiss a frank statement of our views on the naval phase of the
                                    disarmament problem as it bears upon the security of France. To
                                    us it seems clear that if it were possible to remove the
                                    French-Italian question from the field of discussion, security
                                    would inevitably be enhanced by the resulting confidence and
                                    good will.</p>
                                <p>If, however, there is continued the present insistence on the
                                    principles of parity on the one hand, and of superiority on the
                                    other, there is danger that security will tend to become
                                    diminished as a result of increasingly bitter discussions. We
                                    are convinced for this reason that, if the present
                                    misunderstanding with Italy should lead France to a rapid and
                                    complete execution of her 1924 program, the result would not be
                                    increased security but exactly the opposite due to the
                                    repercussions in other countries which would probably
                                    follow.</p>
                                <p>It is necessary to bear in mind another consideration: Should the
                                    1924 program be put into rapid execution, it is apparent that
                                    the British Government, when a certain point is reached, would
                                    invoke article 21 of the London Treaty, thus upsetting the
                                    existing threepower agreement. Naval competition between the
                                    three signatory powers has been eliminated by this agreement;
                                    any event which upsets the agreement would certainly give rise
                                    to misgivings among the peoples of these three countries. It was
                                    my desire to draw attention to this merely as a fact which is
                                    evident.</p>
                                <p>I should like to express another thought as regards this
                                    controversy. In analyzing the problems between your two
                                    countries, it has seemed to us that these problems are far from
                                    insoluble, and that by a single step of real leadership it would
                                    be easily possible materially to improve relations between
                                    France and Italy. There would appear to be little hope of an
                                    agreement if negotiations are to be continued on the present
                                    basis, according to such information as we have regarding the
                                    progress of these discussions. The Italian insistence on naval
                                    parity cannot be reconciled with French insistence on naval
                                    superiority. It seems to us, however, that as a practical matter
                                    this immediate <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0238"
                                    />difficulty could be put to one side by a gesture of real
                                    political leadership by means of a unilateral declaration by
                                    both countries, postponing, until 1936, the question of
                                    principle and announcing, for the intervening period, restricted
                                    programs of construction. These declarations would of course be
                                    entirely unilateral and spontaneous as regards their public
                                    effect. As a practical matter, however, it would be necessary to
                                    coordinate them between France and Italy beforehand, and to make
                                    sure that the declarations really meet the situation as far as
                                    concerns Great Britain.</p>
                                <p>I am under the impression that the French delegation made this
                                    suggestion informally during the London Conference and it is our
                                    belief that at this time this offers the one practical way
                                    toward a solution. You will recall that a similar idea has
                                    already proved very useful as regards the slowing up of this
                                    year’s building programs; and we believe that if this French
                                    idea could be adopted, both countries could easily leave out of
                                    consideration, for the next five years, the parity problem. What
                                    is more, a gesture of this sort would produce an atmosphere of
                                    harmony which would increase the possibility of later on
                                    reaching the more lasting agreement.</p>
                                <p>In the event that the French Government could see its way to
                                    declaring that, in the absence of unforeseen factors, it
                                    proposed to hold up until 1936 its 1924 building program as
                                    regards auxiliary vessels, it may be hoped that Italy would
                                    respond with similar declarations thus assuring France the
                                    maintenance of the present difference in the two fleets in favor
                                    of France for the duration of the London Treaty, with the added
                                    advantage of good feeling between France and Italy. Such a
                                    declaration would make it easy for Italy to adopt a similar
                                    program in view of the fact that they also have maintained that
                                    it is their wish to avoid building and that, if given some help
                                    in the face of their own public opinion, they would gladly give
                                    up building. As you have no controversy with Italy concerning
                                    the building of capital ships within the Washington Treaty
                                    tonnage, the real problem is definitely restricted, thus leaving
                                    only new construction in auxiliary craft. Nor would replacements
                                    presumably be affected. What we propose, briefly, is that on the
                                    subject of parity there should be neither a diplomatic victory
                                    nor a diplomatic defeat, but that both countries should
                                    expressly reserve their position on this question until 1936, if
                                    they desire to do so, and that their declarations should be
                                    limited to a statement of their intentions during the period up
                                    to the expiration of the London Naval Treaty.</p>
                                <p>What I am saying to you bears especially on the French phase of
                                    the problem, naturally; but I am leaving for Rome in order to
                                    state the case to Grandi after my conversation with you. I have
                                    instructions to urge Italy to give up the idea of a diplomatic
                                    victory at this time, and to postpone the question of parity in
                                    order to facilitate any measure you may feel justified in taking
                                    in order to reach a solution of this difficulty.</p>
                                <p>I would like to say only one more thing: This is the first time
                                    in history that there has been a long, patient, and scientific
                                    effort to prepare the basis for a limitation and reduction of
                                    the armaments of all nations. The United States also recognizes
                                    that French initiative has been largely instrumental in bringing
                                    about this effort, and that a large role in the work has been
                                    played by the French delegations at <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159"
                                        facs="0239"/>Geneva. The moment has now arrived when we can
                                    hope that what has been done may be practically applied. There
                                    will inevitably result a deep general discouragement and
                                    disillusionment if the enterprise collapses at this point, and a
                                    definite setback to the whole cause of disarmament would ensue.
                                    If, on the other hand, this dangerous problem can be set aside
                                    by a new evidence of French leadership, a new impulse will be
                                    given to a movement toward security just as much as to the
                                    movement toward disarmament. For this reason, the President and
                                    the Secretary of State, persuaded of the great importance of
                                    this problem, have regarded it as a friendly duty to send me to
                                    call on you in order to submit this suggested solution and to
                                    ask you to give your careful and friendly consideration to our
                                    proposal.”</p>

                        <p>345. From Gibson. Wilson and I, following Tardieu’s suggestion, today
                            went over the naval question with Massigli. Evidently he was pleased
                            with the possibility of an agreement; he urged me to tell the Italian
                            Government that the French were ready and anxious to resume
                            conversations at any moment. He said the French had been prevented from
                            resuming conversations themselves by the Fascist Grand Council’s
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Massigli informed us further that he had called on the British Ambassador
                            this morning in order to discuss an arrangement concerning tonnage
                            levels in auxiliary vessels and he hoped that a solution might be
                            arrived at with the British along lines somewhat as follows: <list>

                                    Massigli hoped that a solution might be found by slowing up

                            an all-round agreement might be reached.</p>
                        <p>Massigli repeatedly emphasized in the course of our conversations the
                            earnest desire of the French Government to solve this troublesome
                            problem. He thereby confirmed the remark of Tardieu, which I omitted in
                            my telegram No. 341 yesterday, to the effect that really vital problems
                            beset him to such an extent that he would be the first to welcome any
                            method of getting rid of this one problem which was troublesome out of
                            all proportion to its real importance. This was repeated by him with
                            obvious sincerity and in several different ways.</p>

                        <p>The Italian Ambassador came to say that he had reported what took place
                            between him and me when he brought me Signor Grandi’s answer to my first
                            conversation with him (de Martino), and that Signor Grandi said that
                            Italy had proposed concessions and proposed a holiday and had received
                            no answer. What more could she do? I then said that since I had sent my
                            first message to Signor Grandi we had been making progress with France;
                            that Mr. Gibson had had conferences in Paris with Monsieur Tardieu which
                            made me more hopeful than I was a week ago; that Mr. Gibson was going to
                            Rome to have conferences with Signor Grandi, and I hoped that the
                            Ambassador would say to Mr. Grandi that I trusted that Grandi would hear
                            him with sympathy and with the attention which I thought the importance
                            of the situation demanded. I said that I regarded the situation as
                            extremely important and hopeful. He said he would report that to
                            Grandi.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had been troubled by Signor Mussolini’s speech<note
                                n="67" xml:id="d146fn67">Delivered at Rome on October 27.</note> but
                            had been encouraged by the fact that the French press and the French
                            Government had seemed to take it temperately. He said, “Why that speech
                            was made in the American way,” and that he had been congratulated by
                            Americans on the fact that Mussolini brought out the facts into the
                            light of public opinion and that that was the only way they could be
                            settled. He said, too, that the speech was most pacific, that Mussolini
                            said that Italy would attack no one. I then asked him, laughing, whether
                            I was to understand from him that when in Italy a man shook his fist at
                            another he intended to blow a kiss to that other. If that was so, that
                            was not the American method of speech to which he alluded. He laughed
                            but made no reply. When we parted, I went back to Gibson’s visit to
                            Grandi and renewed my injunction that he should tell Grandi that I
                            regarded that as a most important visit and that the situation was
                            hopeful and I prayed that Grandi would give it most careful
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>He read me something which he said came from German newspaper sources,
                            suggesting that if America would reduce the interest on the French debt,
                            France would reduce her navy. I told him I had heard nothing of that
                            sort and could not discuss it.</p>
                        <p>He referred to the French contention that France was compelled to defend
                            herself on two seas, whereas Italy only on one, and he handed me a
                            memorandum which had been prepared in answer to <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0242"/>that subject, which is annexed hereto
                            as “A”. I glanced over it and told him of course I did not want to get
                            into a discussion of naval strategy with him, but from my hasty
                            examination of it it would seem to me that France would answer that this
                            memorandum was based upon the assumption that France was fighting only
                            Italy alone, whereas the French would say that they were compelled to
                            face the very strong possibility that they might be fighting with two
                            enemies at the same time. He replied that that was the same with Italy,
                            but we would not discuss naval strategy at this meeting.</p>
                        <p>I recalled to him my speech of last June, in which I had said that the
                            naval officer saw only one-half of the horizon of national defense and
                            failed to see that portion of national defense which depended upon the
                            cultivation of such moral defense as good will; that the statesman must
                            see the whole horizon and that I hoped that France and Italy in their
                            situation would not shut their eyes to this important one-half of the
                            horizon and would not descend to the situation of the naval strategist.
                            He said he agreed with me.</p>

                            <p>With reference to the French contention that France is compelled to
                                defend herself on two seas, the following considerations shall be
                                taken into account: <list>

                                    <item>It is absurd to think of the possibility of an Italian
                                        naval attack against the French coast in the British Channel
                                        or in the Atlantic, in view of the absence of Italian naval
                                        bases in these waters: therefore, an eventual war could only
                                        be fought by the two Navies in the Mediterranean.</item>
                                    <label>2)</label>
                                    <item>Italy is entirely dependent upon the sea for her material
                                        existence in contrast with France who in the first place has
                                        much greater resources in her own territory than Italy, and
                                        in the second place she can depend for her supplies on her
                                        ports in the British Channel and in the Atlantic, which are
                                        safe from attack from Italy.</item>

                                    <item>Italy has 4.300 nautical miles of coasts and metropolitan
                                        islands to defend, while France has only 960. Taking also
                                        into consideration the colonies (speaking only of the
                                        territories with Mediterranean coasts) Italy has a total of
                                        5.425 nautical miles of coasts to defend, while France has
                                        only 2.578.</item>
                                    <label>4)</label>
                                    <item>The Italian coasts are much more vulnerable than the
                                        French coasts. On the Italian coasts, or at gun range from
                                        same, are located industrial centers of vital importance and
                                        large open cities, more numerous and important than the
                                        French. As regards the <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163"

                                        Italy, as it was again demonstrated in the world war. The
                                        Italian coast is completely open, while the opposite coast
                                        is protected by natural defenses almost
                                        insurmountable.</item>

                        <p>101. From Gibson. At half past five this afternoon Garrett took me to
                            call on Grandi. When I had concluded my message, which I delivered in
                            considerable detail, Grandi expressed no views as to possibility of
                            finding a solution by the method we have suggested, but he gave me a
                            detailed recital of the French-Italian negotiations since the
                            termination of the London Conference. His story contained nothing new of
                            importance; it was unfortunately like the opposite side of the question
                            as I had heard it in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Grandi said that evidently the French Government, thanks to the interest
                            we had shown in the subject, had taken steps to explain that their
                            failure to send a further communication to Italy after Briand’s
                            consultation with the Cabinet did not constitute a rupture in the
                            French-Italian discussions, but was due wholly to the fact that the
                            French were precluded from making further advances by the resolution of
                            the Fascist Grand Council on parity. He added that he had informed the
                            French Ambassador that as far as the Italian Government was concerned
                            the resolution merely reiterated the consistent position held by Italy
                            and that not in any sense need it be considered an obstacle to further
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador told Grandi that the Government of the Republic was
                            anxious to take up the discussions again, and he suggested that possibly
                            Rosso might be sent back to Paris for that purpose. Grandi told him that
                            Rosso could hardly be sent a second time to Paris on an errand of this
                            kind, but that in any event Rosso or someone else with other Italian
                            experts would be in Geneva next week for the meeting of the Preparatory
                            Commission, and at that time would be ready to meet the French
                            representatives there.</p>
                        <p>Grandi added bluntly, that Italy was obliged to “save her face;” that she
                            had, as a matter of fact, surrendered the essence of parity in her own
                            proposals at Geneva while at the same time trying to maintain a
                            semblance of parity with a view to satisfying public opinion.<note

                                132</ref>.</note> Several times, Grandi repeated that Italy would be
                            reluctant <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0244"/>to build up to any
                            French program and would begrudge money taken from other more urgent
                            enterprises to spend on naval building, but, on the other hand, some
                            semblance of parity must be insisted on for the sake of Italian public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with the French Ambassador, Grandi had spoken of the
                            approaching end of the naval holiday for 1930 with misgiving and had
                            told him that he looked forward with concern to the possible need, if no
                            accord was reached by January 1931, of laying down forty-odd thousand
                            tons.</p>
                        <p>Grandi confined himself to repeating that Italy ardently desired an
                            agreement, although I offered him several opportunities to express his
                            views as to the possibilities of our suggestion. He stated that Italy
                            would welcome any possible solution, but said nothing which gave us
                            ground for feeling that the next move might come from Italy. Finally, he
                            expressed gloom almost amounting to hopelessness as to achieving any
                            agreement satisfactory to the French Government.</p>
                        <p>I am to see Mussolini tomorrow or Saturday according to arrangements
                            which Grandi is making. At that time an opportunity for getting further
                            light on the Italian attitude may or may not be afforded.</p>

                        <p>102. From Gibson. The American press correspondents here, having been
                            advised from Washington that I was in Rome, asked to be received today.
                            They arrived in a body after lunch, and several of them produced
                            messages from their offices in Washington to the effect that I had been
                            sent to Rome on special mission as the personal representative of the
                            President and had been given a free hand to bring about a naval
                            understanding between Italy and France. In some of the messages the
                            terms good offices and mediation were used.</p>
                        <p>Through their representatives these messages from the American press were
                            so wholly inaccurate that I was able to deny them, confining what I said
                            to the statement that both in Paris and here I had discussed
                            particularly important questions on the agenda of the Preparatory
                            Commission in the hope that we might be able to speed matters so as to
                            make this meeting the last.</p>
                        <p>This statement is entirely accurate, as, both in Paris and here, I have
                            gone over the agenda in considerable detail, and in such conversations
                                <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0245"/>as I have had in both
                            capitals I have made it clear to the respective Governments that I was
                            not on any special mission, that I did not have any mandate to offer
                            mediation or good offices, and that my role was limited to repeating
                            substance of your conversations with the French and the Italian
                            Ambassadors at Washington.</p>

                        <p>103. From Gibson. Rosso came to see me this morning under instructions
                            from Grandi and asked me to go over the whole naval problem with him.
                            After full explanations Rosso expressed himself as inclined to feel that
                            the plan you have suggested offered the best way out for Italy yet
                            devised, at the same time holding advantages for the French which they
                            would not find it easy to resist.</p>
                        <p>Rosso repeated what Grandi had said yesterday, to the effect that the
                            Italians were anxious to avoid building up to parity with the French,
                            and he added that the solution suggested would enable Italy to forego
                            building without incurring the reproach that the principle of parity had
                            been abandoned.</p>
                        <p>Today Grandi lunched at the Embassy and talked over the naval problem for
                            a short time in terms which seemed to us distinctly more optimistic than
                            were those he used yesterday regarding the possibility of solving the
                            present problem.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon at 5 o’clock he took me to make a courtesy call on
                            Mussolini. We discussed the general work of the Preparatory Commission
                            for the Disarmament Conference for about 20 minutes, but no reference
                            was made to the French-Italian naval problem. (I gathered the impression
                            that this silence may have been so that Mussolini might be in a position
                            to say to the press that we had not discussed French-Italian relations,
                            in view of the sensational reports from Washington appearing in the
                            press to which I referred in my telegram No. 102, October 31, 7 p.m.; I
                            emphasize fact that this subject was not discussed so that you may be in
                            position to handle any erroneous press despatches.)</p>
                        <p>I expect to leave Rome either Monday or Tuesday, going directly to
                            Geneva.</p>

                        <p>95. For Gibson. Constantine Brown, correspondent of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Chicago Daily News</hi>, has reported to me, from a conversation he
                            had had with the French Naval Attaché here, Sablé, that the British had
                            intervened in the French-Italian naval negotiations with a suggestion
                            which Tardieu had been advised by the French Naval Staff would make a
                            satisfactory solution of the problem and upon which, as a basis,
                            negotiations between the French and the Italians could be resumed.</p>
                        <p>Essential feature of the reported suggestion was that the French had been
                            persuaded that by building three battle cruisers of 22,000 tons each,
                            with 13-inch guns and speed of 34 knots, as they can do under the
                            Washington Treaty, the superiority they desire can be obtained; while at
                            the same time the Italians who do not wish to build such ships can rest
                            on the theoretical parity given them by the same treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Naval Attaché is reported to have said, however, that the French
                            would require a definite private understanding with Mussolini that Italy
                            would not build. Were this arrangement made, the auxiliary tonnage would
                            remain on basis suggested last summer by the Italians.</p>

                        <p>97. For Gibson. Your 104, November 1, 4 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>] p.m. I
                            have not denied categorically that you are discussing French-Italian
                            difficulties, although I have made denial of any suggestion of good
                            offices, mediation, and set formulae. The first story published on the

                        <p>The French Embassy here, furthermore, has told enough to Constantine

                        <p>105. From Gibson. Last night the British Ambassador said that Grandi had
                            told him that your suggested method of solution seemed to be less
                            advantageous for Italy than it was for France. You will remember
                            Grandi’s great deliberation in the assimilation of new ideas. His
                            attitude in this instance may not be taken, perhaps, as final.</p>
                        <p>The Italian press comment so far has been more favorable than that which
                            has been telegraphed from Paris.</p>
                        <p>Grandi told the French Ambassador that he had not reported his
                            conversation with me to Mussolini before I called on the Duce.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador has gone to Paris. It is our impression, which is
                            confirmed by that of the British Ambassador here, that Beaumarchais is
                            so filled with pessimism over possibility of achieving any agreement
                            with Italians that he will be a wet blanket on present hopeful situation
                            in Paris.</p>

                        <p>98. For Gibson. Your No. 105, November 2, 1 p.m. In view of what appears
                            to be Italian reluctance to take any decisive steps, the fact that
                            France has been drawing closer to Britain as far as actual figures go
                            might make desirable the suggestion to the French of <pb n="168"
                                xml:id="pg_168" facs="0248"/>issuing a unilateral declaration on
                            basis of figures acceptable to the British, with proviso that the terms
                            of the declaration would be observed up to 1936, unless some other
                            power’s actual naval construction should render alteration in the
                            program necessary; in other words, a declaration along lines of article
                            21 of the Naval Treaty. By this course the onus of the situation would
                            be put firmly on Italy, and as any change in the French figures would be
                            based on Italy’s actual construction, it should be quite as acceptable
                            to the signatories of the Naval Treaty as the “escape” clause itself of
                            that treaty. Also, such an act on France’s part, not involving an
                            agreement with Italy, should not meet, it would seem, with any
                            difficulty in the French Parliament. I should be willing, if you think
                            the step desirable, for you to go to Geneva by way of Paris and talk
                            over this possibility with Tardieu. As to informing Grandi that such a
                            possibility might be considered, use your own discretion.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us that to obtain an agreement for proper armament levels by
                            France is the most important item, and that it would be a pity to have
                            the efforts to that end nullified by wave of what seems to be
                            professional pessimism on the part of the Ambassadors concerned, the
                            Foreign Offices, and the press.</p>

                        <p>107. From Gibson. At Grandi’s request Garrett and I called on him at 5
                            o’clock this afternoon. He stated that although he wished to tell us
                            something of how our suggestion impressed the Italian Government, he
                            felt somewhat embarrassed in stating anything definite. He said that he
                            had still felt rather optimistic when he had last seen us, because he
                            believed that my conversation in Paris had at least prompted steps to be
                            taken by the French for reopening conversations. (See my telegram No.
                            101, October 30, 7 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>Grandi went on to state that since that time the French Ambassador has
                            made him feel extremely pessimistic by a further call on Friday evening.
                            Beaumarchais stated that the French Government was glad to hear that
                            Grandi was prepared to continue conversations on the naval question, and
                            that if the Italian Government would as a precedent condition abandon
                            the idea of parity, the French Government was ready to acquiesce.</p>
                        <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>In reply Grandi stated that, although they were prepared to make
                            substantial concessions as to substance, they could not agree to abandon
                            their principle previous to discussion. Beaumarchais said that in that
                            case all he could do was to refer the matter back to the French
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that information from several sources indicated that
                            the building of two or three 15,000-ton capital ships was being
                            contemplated by France, who were assuming that Italy could be depended
                            upon not to duplicate their construction inasmuch as this was outside
                            the auxiliary classes. He felt that they would almost inevitably have to
                            duplicate French construction in this class on account of the popular
                            outcry to the effect that their cruiser units would be outclassed by
                            even one of these ships. He indicated by inference that, without
                            reaching such a high figure as 15,000 tons—he mentioned 12,000—the
                            French might construct something to deal with the German <hi
                                rend="italic">Ersatz Preussen</hi>. He added that, in dealing with
                            this question by means of statements which paradoxically announce a
                            program of capital ship construction that would have to be duplicated by
                            Italy, he feared that it might result in an increase in French and
                            Italian naval armaments instead of a decrease and that careful
                            consideration must be given to this matter.</p>
                        <p>Grandi then brought up the subject of the reports coming from Paris and
                            London intimating that France was making ready to come to terms with the
                            parties to the three-power treaty and to complete a four-power
                            agreement. Grandi stated that these reports had caused considerable
                            resentment in Italy as it was felt that purpose of the move was to make
                            Italy appear to be responsible for any future difficulties. When the
                            Italian Ambassador in London had inquired at the Foreign Office
                            regarding the basis of the report, Craigie had told him that “there was
                            nothing official yet” on this subject, that it was nevertheless quite
                            possible, and that he felt it might be rather a good thing as it would
                            tend to force Italy to come to agreement of some sort.</p>
                        <p>Grandi said that he had been bewildered, when our suggestion was under
                            consideration, by the move of the French Government in insisting, as a
                            preliminary to discussion, that Italy surrender her parity principle, as
                            well as by the somewhat ominous allusion to a four-power pact. If he
                            were obliged to give his real thoughts, he told us, he would have to be
                            rather disagreeable as regards other people. We could see plainly that
                            the present French attitude bewilders him.</p>
                        <p>Grandi stated that instructions have been given to the Italian experts on
                            the Preparatory Commission to maintain the offers which Rosso has
                            already made and to examine any other proposals which may be made in a
                            friendly way. Rosso, who was present, interrupted <pb n="170"
                                xml:id="pg_170" facs="0250"/>at this point. Since he himself was the
                            one who was going to handle the problem at Geneva, he wished to clarify
                            what he considered to be Grandi’s views. His statement was that they
                            would maintain his proposals and would examine any others, and that they
                            were quite prepared to examine, through the method we had suggested,
                            whether a solution could be found—a statement from which Grandi did not
                            dissent.</p>
                        <p>Perfect understanding of our helpful attitude in this problem was
                            expressed by Grandi, who stated, however, that we would understand that,
                            his position with the Grand Council being difficult, he would have to be
                            prudent in view of French intransigence.</p>
                        <p>Rosso, after we had left Grandi’s room, asked us to remain so that the
                            situation might be still further clarified. Rosso said that, while he
                            had hoped Grandi would be more outspoken as to his real attitude, he did
                            not hesitate to elaborate it in his own words since it was so definite.
                            He stated that if a direct agreement could be reached with France making
                            possible the completion of the five-power agreement by continuing the
                            conversations after reaching Geneva, this would be preferred as a better
                            arrangement by Italy. In reply to my statement that we would much prefer
                            that the five-power treaty be completed and that our suggestion has been
                            made in the event that this was impossible, he stated that they quite
                            understood this, but that if in Geneva it became obvious that agreement
                            could not be reached by direct negotiations, the Italian Government
                            desired that our method of unilateral declarations be adopted. At my
                            request Rosso repeated this part of the conversation in the same words
                            to Garrett, who had not heard it.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon I talked with the head of the Italian delegation at
                            Geneva, General de Marinis, and as a result of this conversation and
                            conversation with Grandi and Rosso, Garrett and I are convinced that the
                            Italians sincerely desire an agreement and that if they can avoid the
                            appearance of a diplomatic defeat and thus allow Grandi to defend the
                            agreement before the Grand Council, they are willing to make substantial
                            sacrifices. No good effect, we are convinced, would result from any
                            maneuvers to force them into foregoing the principle of parity or, by
                            leaving them out of a four-power agreement, to make them appear
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that, apart from what Grandi has said as to their reluctance
                            to begin a building program, they have every interest in reaching an
                            agreement and consequently avoiding heavy naval expenditure, in view of
                            the fact that the financial situation here is becoming acute.
                            Nevertheless the possibility that something might be put over on them
                            clearly worries them, and if no attempt is made to meet them they may
                            feel that they must duplicate the French program.</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>The French might be inclined to make exacting terms, we fear, if the
                            foregoing were communicated to them.</p>
                        <p>We do not think, in any event, that anything can be done here to deal
                            with this phase of the problem. You may, however, wish to use some
                            moderating influence on France either directly or through the British,
                            making clear to the latter that if the Italians were allowed to infer
                            that they were being maneuvered into an awkward position by the
                            Franco-British negotiations (telegram No. 342, from Paris, October 27,
                            10 p.m.) which have been reported in the press, it would have an
                            unfortunate effect.</p>

                        <p>2. We have been turning over in our own minds various possible ways of
                            reconciling the French desire for naval superiority in auxiliary craft
                            with Italian desire for the appearance of parity, and we should like to
                            submit the following for your consideration as one possible means of
                            achieving this. If you approve the suggestion, it might be held in
                            reserve to be put forth informally in the event that the pending
                            French-Italian negotiations are deadlocked again.</p>
                        <p>In view of the French ships which are still in commission, a considerable
                            portion of any French naval construction program could be described as
                            “replacement.” It might be possible, therefore, for the French to
                            declare a program of replacement to end in 1936, which might amount
                            practically to a holiday on “construction.” Besides this, the French
                            might announce a unified program of construction, and if any question
                            were to be raised in the Fascist Grand Council, Grandi could say that he
                            had obtained full parity in “construction” and that Italian replacements
                            obviously were not governed by French “replacements” but by age and
                            condition of Italian ships.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we have not tried any suggestions of this sort while the
                            efforts of France and Italy to reach an agreement in their own way are
                            continuing, but if we were in a position to offer an informal suggestion
                            at the right moment we might promote agreement.</p>
                        <p>The statement made by Grandi that Italy would feel obliged to duplicate
                            France’s construction in capital ships is due, in our opinion, to
                            present acute disagreement over auxiliaries, and it may well turn out
                            that, if agreement is reached on auxiliaries, the Italians will no <pb
                                n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0252"/>longer feel that they must
                            duplicate French building under the Washington Treaty in view of fact
                            that their parity in this heavier craft is clearly recognized.</p>
                        <p>In any event, we assume that construction under the Washington Treaty
                            does not concern us directly, as we are not in a position to question
                            it. Wholly apart from this, as participation by France and Italy in the
                            1936 conference is essential, we believe that we must be careful to
                            avoid at this time any action which will leave either power with the
                            feeling that treaty rights of either were called into question, and
                            thereby make for a reluctance on their part to undertake further
                            decrease in 1936.</p>
                        <p>We should find it very helpful if you would let us have your views on the
                            feasibility of suggested division of programs into two parts, and if you
                            would give us any alternative suggestions which might, in case of need,
                            be advanced informally.</p>

                        <p>3. Reference is made to my telegram No. 107, November 3, from Rome. This
                            morning I was visited by Massigli. I said to him that I thought that
                            there was obviously a misunderstanding between the French and Italian
                            Governments in regard to the message which was delivered last Friday by
                            the French Ambassador, and I repeated this message as Beaumarchais gave
                            it to me and also as Grandi had repeated it to me. Thereupon I stated
                            that the effect had been most unfortunate but that the Italian
                            Government had nevertheless declared that they desire that direct
                            agreement should be reached or that, if this proves impossible, the
                            proposed program of unilateral declarations should be carried out.</p>
                        <p>The telegram to Beaumarchais from the Foreign Office in Paris, which
                            contained his instructions for this conversation, was next read to me by
                            Massigli. The telegram, opened by saying that France would gladly resume
                            naval conversations with the Italian Government, but it would be
                            necessary, if any practical result was to be expected, that the
                            conversations be directed to the subject of concrete figures, the
                            question of parity being set aside. The French Government, the message
                            continued, desired to emphasize to him that they wish nothing which
                            could in any way embarrass my mission or which would create anything but
                            a favorable atmosphere for a negotiation. <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                                facs="0253"/>They desired to make things as easy as possible for
                            Italy and to afford a graceful way out for the Italian Government. The
                            matter is being taken up with Rome this morning by Massigli who will no
                            doubt put matters right with the Italian Government.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador called today and first asked whether I had read his
                            note of two days ago. I told him that I had received a verbal report of
                            it through Mr. Marriner but had not read it myself. I sent for Mr.
                            Marriner who came in with the report and the Ambassador then said he did
                            not have anything further to discuss about it.</p>
                        <p>It then developed what his real mission was. He asked me about his
                            suggestion the other day of having France build battleships under her
                            rights in the Washington Treaty and asked whether I had reported that to
                            Mr. Gibson. The information which I had just received from Mr.
                            Constantine Brown about a half an hour before, as to the difference
                            between the French Admiralty and the French Government, at once recurred
                            to my mind. I asked the French Ambassador whether I correctly understood
                            his proposition to be that if France built these 3 battleships, as she
                            had a right to do under the Treaty, this would serve to establish the
                            superiority over Italy which she desired and would permit France to be
                            generous to Italy in the other categories, namely, the auxiliary ships?
                            He at once said that that was his idea. I said, of course if his
                            proposition merely was that France would build the battleships and then
                            also insist upon her contention of superiority over Italy in the
                            auxiliary vessels, it would be of no assistance. He said, “Oh, no. My
                            proposition was the first one that you mentioned.” I then said in
                            response to his question that I did not report this to Mr. Gibson
                            because I had thought that this suggestion came from the French
                            Government and that in that case of course Mr. Gibson would already have
                            it from Mr. Tardieu. The French Ambassador at once said, “No, that was
                            my suggestion. Not my Government’s. It is to be taken as originating in
                            the air and was suggested as a means of helping.” I thanked him warmly
                            for his kindness in coming to correct the error which I had made and
                            said that I would report it to Gibson at once.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing would seem to be a clear confirmation of Constantine
                            Brown’s statement about Sablé’s attitude, namely, that the French <pb
                                n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0254"/>Admiralty has a plan which they
                            would agree to and they have been trying to get it to us in this
                            indirect way. In view of this, his statement to the effect that Tardieu
                            is opposed to this proposition on account of its expense and prefers to
                            try to maintain French superiority in auxiliary construction in order to
                            achieve his aim of superiority over Italy and still keep his budget
                            lowered, may also be correct.</p>

                        <p>1. Your No. 2, November 5, 11 p.m. This morning the French Ambassador
                            called on me and brought up the suggestion, which had previously come to
                            me indirectly through a well-known press correspondent, that France
                            should exercise her rights under the Washington Treaty and should build
                            three battle cruisers, all of high speed, and that if this construction
                            could be accomplished on some tacit understanding that the Italians
                            would not build, at the same time retaining their rights under the
                            Washington Treaty, it might be possible to reach a practical parity in
                            auxiliary craft.</p>
                        <p>Claudel asked me whether I had informed you of this suggestion. I said
                            that I had not, as I assumed you had heard of it from Tardieu in Paris;
                            I refrained from mentioning your discussion of it with Grandi (telegram
                            No. 107, November 3, 9 p.m., from Rome). Claudel said that in all
                            probability Tardieu had not discussed this proposition as it was his,
                            the Ambassador’s, own idea which he had put forward merely to be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>To give you further background, it appears that the suggestion must have
                            emanated originally from the Naval Attaché of the French Embassy, who
                            discussed it with one of the press correspondents about a week ago. The
                            latter reported it to the Department. As no comment was elicited from
                            the Department, the Naval Attaché again urged his press acquaintance to
                            tell the Department that comment on the suggestion was desired. The
                            inference was also drawn by the correspondent in question that the
                            proposition was viewed very favorably by the French Admiralty, although
                            it was less acceptable to the Prime Minister, who did not see in it any
                            possibility of economy.</p>
                        <p>Referring to your suggestion in event of French-Italian negotiations
                            approaching deadlock, it seems wholly satisfactory here that each side
                            consider the possibility of differentiating between replacement <pb
                                n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0255"/>and new construction, and that
                            a parity in new construction might be reached, always taking into
                            account the fact that the new building together with any replacement
                            construction must still be within bounds which are acceptable to the
                            parties to the London Naval Treaty.</p>

                        <p>9. From several sources it is reported that the French Government and the
                            French delegation feel that the American delegation can exercise, in
                            their negotiations with Italy, a very favorable influence. We are
                            inclined to believe that they may have instructions along this line
                            since this has been made so clear. A similar hope that we will exercise
                            friendly influence has been expressed here by the Italians.</p>
                        <p>It may be possible, on account of this attitude on the part of the two
                            delegations, for us to exercise a helpful conciliatory influence when
                            occasion arises. However, I feel that you ought to know that we are
                            leaning over backward to make it clear that we have no desire to
                            exercise mediation or good offices, and that we think that in their
                            fortunate resumption of direct negotiations lies the best hope at
                            present.</p>

                        <p>361. Information, which seems reliable, has been received to the effect
                            that the French Ministry of Marine and Louis Aubert, who was at the
                            London Naval Conference with Tardieu, have every confidence in Gibson’s
                            ability and disinterestedness and very much hope that his good offices
                            may be available in any negotiations looking to a solution of the naval
                            situation that may be carried on between France and Italy. Information
                            has also been received that Aubert, <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176"
                                facs="0256"/>in view of the above, has advised Tardieu that
                            instructions to keep Gibson fully informed of all developments should be
                            given to the French delegation at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>My own knowledge of Tardieu’s friendship for and confidence in Gibson
                            confirms the above. As the Department is aware, I was present at the
                            interview between Gibson and Tardieu on October 27 of this year. On that
                            occasion it was very evident that this confidence of Tardieu in Gibson
                            and in his sincerity largely contributed to the favorable reception
                            which the new suggestions received from Tardieu and the French.</p>
                        <p>Feeling that these impressions might be useful as background in case they
                            should fit in with your information from other sources, I take the
                            liberty of submitting them to you.</p>

                        <p>14. I received a call this afternoon from Massigli. He stated that he had
                            had a talk with Rosso in order to ascertain whether there was any basis
                            for profitable resumption of naval conversations. In reply to the
                            question whether Italy would insist, in laying down figures, on
                            maintaining the appearance of parity, it was suggested by Rosso that
                            such was the effect of his instructions. It was next stated by Massigli
                            that at the present time this subject of conversation did not seem to be
                            a profitable one and inquiry in regard to other alternatives was made,
                            in reply to which Rosso stated that, while preferring that the
                            five-power treaty be completed, if it should prove impossible the
                            Italian Government would be ready to consider unilateral declarations as
                            an alternative.</p>
                        <p>Having been asked by Massigli whether Italy would feel obliged to
                            announce the same program, if France laid down a program in its
                            declarations, Rosso replied in the affirmative. After which it was
                            stated by Massigli that in this case it might be more profitable if the
                            discussion were approached from another angle. He asked whether Rosso
                            was willing that the question of levels as between the British and the
                            French Navies should be discussed with Craigie by Massigli, to which
                            Rosso agreed rather reluctantly. The above is confirmed by Craigie who
                            talked with both Massigli and Rosso. He adds that, awaiting certain
                            instructions requested by Massigli, the discussions <pb n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177" facs="0257"/>between Britain and France cannot take
                            place until the end of this week.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of a distinction between replacements and new
                            construction is being examined by Britain and France in the meantime, to
                            see if anything can be done toward having both France and Italy announce
                            a holiday in new construction so that the question of parity may be
                            avoided and a satisfactory French superiority in replacement worked out.
                            The possibility of declarations to cover the period up to and including
                            1933, which may simplify the problem, has been discussed by Craigie and
                            Massigli as a last resort.</p>

                        <p>17. This evening I received a call from Rosso, who stated that he wanted
                            to tell us about his conversations with Craigie and Massigli, so as to
                            explain his own thoughts to us and to ask our opinion in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Rosso stated that he had, in his talk with Massigli, very frankly
                            explained the Italian political situation, one element being impatient
                            of any efforts to conciliate France, an attitude tending to throw them
                            into the camp of those who desire existing treaties to be revised; and
                            another element, which included Grandi, being sincerely anxious that a
                            more farsighted course, which involved finding a solution of the
                            existing difficulties with France, should be followed; that even on
                            questions of naval figures he felt that, in order to strengthen the
                            element which favors a saner course, this should be borne in mind.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the possibility of unilateral declarations, Rosso had
                            told Massigli that naturally any figures used by France must be
                            forwarded to Rome, and that undoubtedly the Admiralty would press for
                            duplication of France’s program, presumably in disguised form to render
                            it more difficult of comparison. It would in its essence, however, have
                            to contain equality in construction tonnage, a policy which for six
                            years had already been followed. This would enable Italy to justify the
                            declarations, yet it must not be forgotten by France that this would
                            involve approval of France’s present superiority until 1936, clearly
                            postponing the thesis of acknowledging full parity with France held “by
                            the Admiralty.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0258"/>
                        <p>In his talk with Craigie, Rosso said that he had been concerned by
                            Craigie’s insistence that our suggestion envisaged an agreement upon the
                            levels to be achieved in 1936, and not a statement of programs for the
                            next 5 years. The readiness of Italy to consider unilateral
                            declarations, Rosso said, was based on the fact that the virtue of this
                            expedient for Italy lay in its avoidance of the question of levels which
                            could be compared. Italy would be left in a visibly inferior position,
                            which Grandi would have difficulty in justifying, by specification of
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>It was further stated by Rosso that the good understanding as a result of
                            satisfactory unilateral declarations might, of course, subsequently
                            render possible that some formula for entering the treaty between now
                            and 1936 would be found. I stated, in reply to a direct question as to
                            my views, that I felt it was important that unnecessary complications
                            should not disturb the present hopeful atmosphere; that it was the
                            present desire of the French and the British, so far as I knew from my
                            conversations with them, that they should devote themselves to finding a
                            possible agreement with the Italians, regular French adherence to the
                            treaty not being pressed at this time; that our suggestions had been
                            made, so far as we were concerned, with the desire that both France and
                            Italy should reach some sort of agreement that would carry forward the
                            idea of a five-power understanding; and that we were anxious, in our
                            rather detached position as regards figures, that all the parties to the
                            London negotiations should be able to reach a general agreement in a
                            contented frame of mind, so that in 1936 they would be disposed to come
                            back willingly to a conference.</p>
                        <p>Rosso expressed his intention to have a further talk with Massigli. He
                            proposed to state that, if the French would declare their program up to
                            1936, he would transmit the figures to Rome, and would recommend, in
                            order to make comparison as difficult as possible, the distribution of
                            the tonnage of the Italian program in a different way among the

                        <p>The Italian Ambassador had a long telegram which he did not read to me,
                            nor give me the contents of. But he said that Signor Grandi was doubtful
                            whether the French will wish to make an agreement or will refrain from
                            insisting upon recognition of inferiority by Italy. <pb n="179"

                            of Beaumarchais. I told him that I remembered what he had reported
                            Beaumarchais to have said to Signor Grandi and had no reason to
                            discredit Signor Grandi’s report of it as being accurate<note n="73"

                            longer stood in the way of an agreement. I told him that whereas I was a
                            little afraid at first that the French were not anxious to make an
                            agreement, that apprehension on my part had been removed and I was
                            confident now that the French were ready to make a fair agreement. I
                            said that my apprehension had now shifted to whether Italy was ready to
                            do its part and that I was inclined to fear that she was not. I told him
                            that I was keeping in touch with the conversations which were going on
                            in Geneva and I wished he would convey to Signor Grandi what I said,
                            namely, that I felt sure that the French were ready to make a fair
                            agreement and that I hoped Italy would not block it. He said he would do
                            so.</p>

                        <p>20. I received a call this evening from Craigie, who stated that he sees,
                            from his various conversations, three possibilities to the solution of
                            the naval difficulty between France and Italy. He enumerated them in
                            order of preference as follows: <list>
                                <item>First point: Tonnage agreement which will enable the
                                    five-power treaty to be entered.</item>
                                <item>Second point: Building program unilateral declarations—the
                                    possibility that after such declarations the treaty might be
                                    entered on building programs alone without translating the
                                    figures into tonnage levels, the disparity of total tonnages of
                                    the two fleets thus not being thrown into relief, was not
                                    excluded by him.</item>
                                <item>Third point: The treaty to be entered by France after a level
                                    acceptable to the three signatories has been worked out; this
                                    should be envisaged only if agreeable to Italy, in his
                                    opinion.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The first point, obviously the most desirable, is the one on which
                            efforts are now being concentrated, and various possibilities are being
                            explored which do not warrant detailed report since they are too <pb
                                n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0260"/>nebulous as yet. We cannot,
                            however, be sure that at any time an abrupt turn in the direction of the
                            third point will not take place. The procedure to be followed if this
                            should materialize is being envisaged by us.</p>
                        <p>It is plain from Rosso’s remarks, and those of other Italians here, that
                            the Italian Government is nervous over press reports of such an
                            impending change in events and it fears that French entrance into the
                            treaty, if she lays down figures agreeable to Britain, will enable her
                            to veto adherence by Italy except on France’s terms, for the reason that
                            the other three Powers naturally, without the consent of the fourth
                            party to the treaty, could not admit Italy. If France is admitted and
                            Italy later requests admission on the same tonnage levels, it seems to
                            us that the position of the three original signatories might become
                            embarrassing. In case they should agree to France’s veto on Italian
                            admission, they run the risk of seeming to favor France by making
                            themselves judges of the issue of parity; they would be accused, on the
                            other hand, of deciding in favor of Italy in case they should bring
                            pressure on France to admit Italy on similar terms.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to envisage a situation in which France can accept the
                            treaty without aggravating the situation with Italy, after direct
                            agreement has failed. We feel that it would be a mistake, no matter how
                            important and desirable it may be to complete the five-power agreement,
                            for us to lose sight of the fact, which we have consistently maintained,
                            that naval limitation is a continuing process and that we have a general
                            interest in bringing all five naval powers back into succeeding
                            conferences both confidently and willingly.</p>
                        <p>We have kept these misgivings to ourselves, reporting them to you only to
                            give you the whole picture as our conversations have shown it to us. We
                            have been careful in talking with the Italians not to dispel their
                            anxiety that, should other efforts fail, the above possibility
                            exists.</p>

                        <p>31. We have learned from Craigie who has called that, in a lengthy
                            conversation with Rosso, he, Craigie, had suggested to the Italian
                            delegate a plan for auxiliary vessels which would work out along the
                            following lines: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Other than the completion of the 1930 program, no 8-inch-gun
                                    cruisers to be constructed between now and 1936.</item>
                                <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0261"/>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>In 6-inch-gun cruisers, replacement only; that is, no new
                                    construction.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>For destroyers, the same policy as laid down in point
                                    2.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Upon completion of the 1930 program, no construction of
                                    submarines.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Briefly, this adds up to a naval holiday with regard to points 1 and 4,
                            and the construction of replacements only under points 2 and 3.</p>
                        <p>On points 1 and 2 this amounts to an approximate parity, and on points 3
                            and 4 France is left a considerable margin of superiority.</p>
                        <p>Rosso did not at all commit himself but raised no objection to Craigie’s
                            suggestion that he, Craigie, go over this matter with Massigli. Rosso
                            merely requested that the fact that he had even heard of it should not
                            be mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Massigli, whom Craigie saw next, showed the latter a new offer which he,
                            Massigli, had just received from Dumesnil. The new offer essentially
                            provides that the two fleets remain on their present levels. There
                            should be replacement only, no new construction. Craigie states that the
                            French would plan replacements to the extent of about 50,000 tons
                            annually. Having less replaceable material, the Italians would have to
                            be satisfied with a considerably smaller program. This, Craigie
                            indicated to Massigli, was a considerably worse offer than the French
                            had made at London. There the French had included about 100,000 tons of
                            over-age material in their proposal of 685,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon Craigie introduced the plan outlined in the first paragraph of
                            this telegram. After hours of discussion an agreement was reached. Until
                            he had had further talks with Massigli concerning the Craigie proposal,
                            the British delegate would not submit the Dumesnil plan to Rosso.</p>
                        <p>The essential points of what Craigie had told us were confirmed by
                            Massigli when he called. Massigli declared, however, that under the
                            Dumesnil plan the French building program would not be 50,000 tons per
                            annum but approximately 40,000.</p>
                        <p>It has become more and more obvious that both the Italians and French,
                            rather than negotiating by means of direct conversations, prefer
                            negotiating through the intermediary of Craigie.</p>

                        <p>58. Owing to illness of both Craigie and Rosso, the French-Italian naval
                            discussions have been delayed and are now definitely adjourned <pb
                                n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0262"/>while the French Cabinet is
                            being reconstituted. In conversation today, Rosso brought the matter up
                            to date.</p>
                        <p>A messenger was sent to Rome to explain Craigie’s latest proposal and to
                            recommend on Rosso’s behalf that the Italian Government accept it as a
                            basis for discussion. Some days ago a reply was received to the effect
                            that Italy would accept the proposal as a basis for discussion, provided
                            that France also accepted it in its present form.</p>
                        <p>Rosso has analyzed Craigie’s proposal and has picked out certain points
                            which, unless they are altered, present insuperable obstacles for Italy.
                            Reducing proposal to figures, Rosso finds that it works approximately as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>8-inch cruisers. France and Italy 70,000 tons each.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>6-inch cruisers and destroyers. France, 199,000 tons; and
                                    Italy, 157,000 tons.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Submarines. France, 77,000 tons; and Italy, 44,000
                                    tons.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>For technical reasons, Rosso said, a navy can keep on effective service
                            only one submarine out of three; for this reason, the Italian Admiralty
                            is definitely opposed to accepting any figure lower than 52,700 tons
                            while French figures remain at something over 77,000 tons. Rosso is also
                            of the opinion that the 1930 program must be considered as a program of
                            replacement for which obsolete tonnage, if any, is to be scrapped, not
                            as additional program which is to be added on to existing fleet.</p>
                        <p>Rosso has drawn up the following formula with these two considerations in
                            mind: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>No further construction of 8-inch cruisers after completion of
                                    the 1930 program;</p>
                                <p>Completion of the 1930 program for 6-inch cruisers and
                                    destroyers, and construction for replacement of over-age vessels
                                    after January 1, 1930 (on being replaced, vessels are to be
                                    scrapped, except certain surface craft of more than 3,000-ton
                                    displacement, which will be kept as “special”);</p>
                                <p>No further construction of submarines except for replacement when
                                    the total tonnage is below 52,700 tons, after completion of the
                                    1930 program, when the tonnage passes this figure, over-age
                                    vessels will be scrapped.</p>
                                <p>The auxiliary fleets reduced to tonnage of 1936 will reach the
                                    following levels: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Both France and
                                    Italy will have 70,000 tons for 8-inch cruisers; (<hi
                                        rend="italic">b</hi>) France will have 187,352 tons for
                                    6-inch cruisers and destroyers, and Italy will have 155,309
                                    tons; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) France will have 77,541 tons
                                    for submarines, and Italy will have 52,700 tons.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Rosso proposes to discuss this formula with Craigie this afternoon. He
                            believes he can obtain his Government’s consent for these figures,
                            although the formula is his own personal proposal. Due to the French
                            Cabinet crisis, this will probably be the last important discussion of
                                <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0263"/>this matter. Rosso does not
                            think that his Government will make an insuperable obstacle of conceding
                            additional small amounts of tonnage. He called attention to his
                            statement of acceptance applying to 6-inch cruisers and destroyers which
                            is as follows:<note n="75" xml:id="d167fn75">Quotation not
                                paraphrased.</note>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With the exception of (blank) number of pre-Washington light
                                    surface craft of more than 3,000 tons displacement which may be
                                    retained as ‘special vessels’”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>He explained that this clause was intended to make acceptance easier for
                            France by permitting them to keep certain old cruisers for colonial
                            use.</p>
                        <p>Desire to discuss building of auxiliary ships along with discussion of
                            building of capital ships has been indicated by the French. Their
                            intention is to build <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with Germany in
                            capital ships and they wanted to have an understanding with Italy on
                            construction to be done by latter. Italy replied stating willingness to
                            talk matters over in friendly spirit, but that it was Italy’s feeling
                            that no agreement involving a limitation of their indubitable rights
                            under the Washington Treaty could be undertaken before a satisfactory
                            agreement had been reached regarding auxiliaries.</p>
                        <p>Rosso invited our attention to the fact that in the past 6 years the
                            French and Italian Navies had each built 197,000 tons. In another 10
                            years of construction, if this pace were continued, they would reach
                            real parity. Naturally Rosso recognized that the French had money and
                            that the Italians had not, and that that was one of the real reasons why
                            the Italians saw definite advantage to their accepting some formula even
                            though it did not accord them satisfaction in matter of recognition of
                            parity.</p>

                        <p>59. Craigie has confirmed what Rosso told me 3 days ago (telegram No. 58,
                            December 6, 11 p.m.). Craigie thinks the additional submarine tonnage of
                            8,000 tons which the Italians are demanding is the only important point
                            between France and Italy.</p>
                        <p>While the French Cabinet crisis has unfortunately halted proceedings at
                            this time, all three negotiators believe that greater possibilities than
                            before are offered by the present situation; as soon as French <pb

                            they will continue to explore these possibilities. It has been
                            recognized by all of them that the discussions were started again by the
                            initiative of the United States, and they highly appreciate our

                        <p>101. Delegation’s telegrams No. 58, December 6, 11 p.m., and No. 59,
                            December 9, 11 a.m. I am informed by Craigie, who is now in Berne, that
                            Rosso went to Rome with the intention of discussing with Grandi the
                            possibility of accepting Craigie’s formula regarding 6-inch cruisers and
                            destroyers, and thus narrowing the conversations regarding auxiliary
                            craft to Italy’s right to build submarines up to 52,700 tons.</p>
                        <p>Rosso told Craigie in Geneva that if the situation were hopeful, he would
                            ask the latter to go to Rome to talk with Grandi. Craigie has now
                            received such an invitation and is going to Rome this evening.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s attitude, at least as Craigie heard it expressed at Geneva, has
                            created, he says, a new difficulty. The Japanese representative feared
                            that the Privy Council would interpose very serious objections to any
                            treaty figures calculated at a higher level than 52,700 tons in
                            submarine category, such as would be permitted by allocating 77,000 tons
                            for French submarines.</p>

                            same, to accept with two exceptions the proposal which Craigie submitted
                            to them. The exceptions are: <list>
                                <item>First, that, instead of the 44,000 tons proposed in the
                                    original plan, Italy must have a minimum of 52,700 tons for
                                    submarines;</item>
                                <item>Second, the idea, which had been proposed in connection with

                                    pre-Washington cruiser tonnage is opposed by Italy.</item>

                        <p>It is Craigie’s feeling, nevertheless, that a very good basis for
                            submission to the French Government has now been obtained. It is
                            suggested that if an agreement is now reached the two Ministers of
                            Marine should embody it in an exchange of unofficial letters. While it
                            is feared by Craigie that there is not enough time to conclude the
                            negotiations before the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations
                            on January 16, it is nevertheless his hope that such a result may be
                            achieved.</p>

                        <p>424. Craigie, who last evening arrived from Rome and is today leaving for
                            London, informs me that since his talk with Mr. Garrett in Rome (a
                            résumé of which has, I understand, been sent to the Department) there is
                            little to report. He also says that the French have expressed a
                            willingness to study the questions further, although they are not
                            entirely satisfied with what he was able to bring them from Rome. He
                            states that submarines and the question of capital ships continue to
                            present the principal difficulties. It is difficult for the French,
                            because of the overthrow of the Government and the political crisis
                            here, to concentrate on the negotiations. Some further delay may be
                            caused by the fact that Sarraut, the new Minister of Marine, has not yet
                            had an opportunity to give his attention to questions other than
                            political ones.</p>
                        <p>I am also informed by Craigie that they hope to decide how and when they
                            are to résumé any further negotiations that may be held; it is his
                            belief that this will not be in any case until about January 3, after
                            the Christmas holidays. He repeated, in conclusion, that he himself was
                            reasonably hopeful and that he felt that difficulties were being
                            eliminated and the eventual solution brought nearer by each exchange of
                            ideas.</p>

                        <p>41. Yesterday Mr. Castle was informed by the Italian Ambassador that the
                            suggestions for an agreement made to them by Craigie were <pb n="186"
                                xml:id="pg_186" facs="0266"/>being considered in the most cordial
                            way by the Italian Government, and that the interest of the British and
                            American Governments in bringing about such an agreement was greatly
                            appreciated by the Italian Government. It was further stated by the
                            Ambassador that Mr. Grandi, however, wished to point out that things
                            were made much more difficult by the malevolent attitude taken toward
                            these conversations by the French press. I have stated at different
                            times, in reply to questions from the press, that you were authorized to
                            do anything, in the interests of settling this question, that in your
                            judgment you thought might be helpful.</p>
                        <p>It might be well, therefore, if you think it wise, for you to get in
                            touch with the appropriate people in London and go down for a talk with
                            the appropriate people in the new Government in Paris. Authorization is
                            hereby given you to proceed to London and/or Paris, and should you do
                            so, you may furnish a copy of this telegram to the Embassy there.</p>

                        <p>1. Reference is made to telegram No. 41, December 31 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >30</hi>], 4 p.m., from the Department. A letter from Massigli, who
                            is now on leave, states that he will come to see me here next week, in
                            order to bring me up to date on recent negotiations and on the steps
                            which, with a view to reaching agreement, he contemplates urging upon
                            his Government. Through Atherton I am communicating with Craigie to
                            learn whether there are any new developments at London which render it
                            desirable for me to proceed there. I question the desirability, unless
                            some way is disclosed in which I can be useful, of going either to
                            London or Paris at this time in view of the way in which the press in
                            both France and Italy have complicated the situation. It is my desire
                            that anything which might introduce fresh conjectures should be avoided
                            and I feel that it is better for me to keep in the background and hold
                            myself in reserve in case of a hitch here and there, so long as direct
                            negotiations continue. Your authorization for me to visit London and
                            Paris is welcome, however, and if the situation warrants it will be
                            acted upon.</p>

                            of the First Committee of the London Conference<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d174fn79">See Department of State Conference Series No. 6,

                                    1930</hi>, pp. 123 ff.</note> which were transmitted to the
                            Secretary General of the League of Nations by the President of that
                            Conference. It may be found necessary to modify the terms in so far as
                            they apply to nations possessing smaller navies. The United States is
                            not disposed to maintain an attitude so rigid as to prevent the
                            inclusion of those foreign navies within the framework of limitation and
                            reduction, and it may be necessary therefore to make such minor
                            adjustments for their benefit as you deem advisable. It is well
                            understood, however, that no such modifications would affect the treaty
                            already existing between the principal naval powers.</p>
                        <p>Among the questions which will come up for discussion is Chapter II,
                            Section III, Article AD, “Air Armaments.”<note n="80" xml:id="d174fn80"

                                    ><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 458.</note> This Government
                            could not agree to any draft which contained a reference to civil
                            aviation as an arm of war or as one of the factors on which the
                            calculation of armed forces is based. Indeed it appears that Article AD
                            would serve merely as a justification for large figures in this field.
                            Furthermore, it would seem that such a statement would have no proper
                            place in the text of an international treaty. Nevertheless, we recognize
                            that to many other States this matter is of paramount importance and if
                            such States feel that they desire to attach to the draft a resolution
                            embodying their own views and not that of all members of the Preparatory
                            Commission, the American Delegation need take no exception thereto.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of Chapter III will bring up the question of budgetary
                            limitation of military expenditures. This Government is of the decided
                            opinion that the acceptance by the United States of any form of direct
                            budgetary limitation is impracticable and on this point the Delegation
                            must stand firm. When defining the Delegation’s position in this matter,
                            it should be clearly stressed that the fullest publicity is given by
                            this Government not only on expenditure, but also on numbers, weights,
                            and units of matériel.</p>
                        <p>The question of a standard account may be discussed. This Government
                            feels that the labor involved in changing the budgetary methods of
                            fifty-odd states would prove very difficult in practice and hardly
                            calculated to produce proportionate results. So far as this <pb n="189"
                                xml:id="pg_189" facs="0269"/>Government is concerned, full and
                            detailed information is given, which could be embodied in any form of
                            presentation or comparison.</p>
                        <p>Chapter V, Section I, Organization. It is understood that fresh plans in
                            this connection will be introduced by the French and British
                            Delegations. This Government is, of course, willing to enter into
                            international cooperation for the fullest exchange of information and
                            for such elucidation of fact as may be contributory to the cause of
                            peace. The American Government is pleased to note that the present
                            tendency of the Preparatory Commission is to move rather in the
                            direction of “information and inquiry” than of “supervision and control”
                            and abandon any form of control in the usually accepted English sense.
                            It is noted with satisfaction that the draft agenda states that in
                            examining this question the Commission will have to take into account
                            the special situation of the United States, which is not a member of the
                            League of Nations. While this Government would, of course, be unable to
                            accept provisions for reference of such matters to the Council of the
                            League of Nations, it would find no difficulty in accepting reference to
                            a body set up by the Treaty which, in addition to a representative of
                            the United States, might contain representatives of those countries
                            represented on the Council.</p>
                        <p>10–Chapter V, Section III, will bring up the question of derogations, or
                            methods of being freed from the obligations of the Treaty in cases of
                            emergency. It is the belief of this Government that the obligations of
                            such a Treaty will be more readily accepted by the various Powers if
                            they feel that in case of genuine need they will not be bound. It is
                            believed by this Government that the States will more voluntarily assume
                            and more scrupulously observe obligations as to armament if they are
                            free in cases of emergency to take adequate measures to protect
                            themselves. We also believe that the states will go much further in the
                            drastic reduction of armament if they are not bound by too long and too
                            rigid terms. This Government is therefore in favor of including a broad
                            escape clause which will merely specify that the nation which believes
                            its security threatened shall, after a public statement of the reasons
                            for this belief, be freed from its obligations, which would leave the
                            decision and responsibility for the invocation of the clause solely to
                            the Signatory Power concerned. In this connection, it may be possible to
                            induce those states bordering on Russia to withdraw their reservation in
                            view of the fact that they may adopt measures for their protection any
                            time occasion demands. Furthermore, the argument for the necessity of
                            including a clause justifying the consideration of the state of civil
                            aviation of neighboring countries, loses a large portion of its value if
                            every state is free to denounce the terms of the Treaty when it feels
                            its security menaced.</p>
                        <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>In connection with the preparation of a report of the Preparatory
                            Commission to the Council of the League of Nations, it is noted that
                            this report will contain recommendations as to the date of the first
                            General Disarmament Conference. It would seem sufficient for the
                            American Delegation to state that this Government hopes for early and
                            effective progress and will be prepared to participate at any date which
                            the Powers are able to agree on as the most efficacious.</p>

                        <p>23. We have been contemplating what form of escape clause would be
                            efficacious and have borne in mind your views to the effect that it
                            should be very liberal in scope. We are of the opinion that a broad
                            escape clause will aid the states bordering on Russia especially to
                            enter a convention and will make it easier for all states to apply lower
                            figures of limitation. In view of these considerations, we have drafted
                            a text on which we would like to have your advice. Inasmuch as we may
                            reach this debate early in the week I would appreciate a reply as soon
                            as convenient. The text of the amendment which we propose to submit to
                            the Secretariat to be circulated in advance as a proposed “American
                            amendment,” is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            suggestion of two possible changes: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>It would seem preferable to omit the words “denounce” and
                                    “denunciation” wherever they occur since they seem to imply a
                                    wider latitude with respect to changes in the proposed
                                    convention than the escape clause is intended to cover. In other
                                    words, there will be separate provisions for the denunciation of
                                    the treaty and changes in any articles thereof would come under

                        <p>7. Your telegram No. 26, November 18, 4 p.m. In view of your misgivings
                            that the phraseology on this subject as modified from the London Naval
                            Treaty would arouse undue comment, I think that it would be preferable
                            to make the phraseology identical, that is to say, “shall promptly
                            advise with each other through diplomatic channels as to the situation
                            thus presented.”</p>
                        <p>Any comment that might be aroused from doing this could be answered by a
                            statement to the effect that this was the principle embodied in the
                            London Naval Treaty, which had received the consent of the United States
                            Senate to ratification. On the other hand, if you think that any
                            proposition of this character would arouse too much comment and too much
                            speculation, I perceive no special reason why the United States should
                            be the one to offer a redraft of the escape clause at all. Is there any
                            reason why debate on the old draft should not be allowed to lead
                            gradually to changes without any specific proposal which could be
                            designated as the American proposal?</p>

                        <p>27. Department’s 6, November 17, 5 p.m. The sentence added by you to our
                            draft reads as follows: “Thereupon the other high contracting parties
                            shall promptly advise with each other as to the situation thus
                            presented.” Taken in conjunction with the preceding sentence of
                            paragraph B, it would appear that the high contracting party seeking to
                            modify its treaty obligations would be excluded from the exchange of
                            views. This phraseology, a modification of that used in article 21 of
                            the London Treaty, is applicable in that treaty to two powers only and
                            the “new construction” leading to invocation of the escape clause can be
                            initiated only by a nonsignatory. I submit for your consideration that
                            in the present instance we are dealing with what is intended to be a
                            universal treaty or one which in any case will have a large number of
                            signatories. Under this treaty, problems arising from action taken by
                            nonsignatory states will be the exception and not the rule. Under the
                            proposed phraseology it <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0273"/>is
                            possible to envisage a situation in which the state modifying a clause
                            or clauses of the treaty is the only state in the world excluded from
                            consultation about this condition. If we maintain the word “other,”
                            state A which has announced its intention of modifying the treaty as a
                            result of some action of state B, the initiator of the trouble, will
                            nevertheless participate. It may seem to you more practical to suppress
                            the word “other,” thus providing consultations with all interested
                            states.</p>
                        <p>In view of this inquiry we will postpone circulating the resolution until
                            we can hear from you on this point. We will then advise regarding the
                            date of circulation.</p>

                        <p>8. Your No. 27, November 18, 7 p.m. The Department is still of the
                            opinion, as it suggested in its No. 7, November 18, 6 p.m., that either
                            you should use phraseology of the London Naval Treaty, or, if you think
                            effect of that phraseology would be unfortunate, you should refrain from
                            making any proposal whatever regarding escape clause.</p>
                        <p>The omission of word “other” would imply right to “advise” as to whether
                            or not the party desiring to make use of escape clause is justified in
                            doing so or not; we desire to avoid this implication, just as we did at
                            the London Naval Conference, in order that the freedom to make use of it
                            shall not be hampered.</p>

                        <p>29. Your No. 7, November 18, 6 p.m. Under the circumstances I think it
                            would be better for the time being to withhold any circulation by us of
                            an escape clause. In all probability in view of the several divergent
                            views now existing regarding derogations, there will be a prolonged
                            debate on this subject. At some period in this debate <pb n="194"
                                xml:id="pg_194" facs="0274"/>it might be well for us to advance the
                            escape clause as contained in our 23, November 15, noon [<hi
                                rend="italic">8 p.m.</hi>], and modified by your paragraph under (1)
                            in No. 6, November 17, noon [<hi rend="italic">5 p.m.</hi>], but
                            omitting the sentence contained in your paragraph (2) of that
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the escape clause without the final sentence, unless you see
                            reasons to the contrary, we think it may be advantageous to sponsor the
                            proposal as we believe it will be of great value in working out a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>We are inclined to believe that any discussion on an escape clause will
                            invariably induce some form of suggestion as to consultation on the
                            situation thereby created. In the event that the suggestion is made by
                            another delegation we believe that acquiescence on our part would avoid
                            in a large measure the undue comment which initiative of the American
                            delegation on this subject would incite. Such procedure might cover the
                            thought that is conveyed in the question contained in your last sentence
                            of telegram 7, November 18, 1 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m.</p>
                        <p>We fear that the words used in article 21 of the London Treaty “through
                            diplomatic channels” would be impractical in a treaty which may have
                            forty or more signatories, particularly as the time element will
                            probably be a factor in any case of derogation. Probably we could
                            restrict the phraseology to the phrase “thereupon the high contracting
                            parties shall promptly advise with each other in every situation thus
                            presented.” Would much appreciate your comment on these matters.</p>

                        <p>9. Your 29, November 19, 9 p.m. Constant crossing of telegrams makes
                            comment difficult. Department does not wish to quibble over words but
                            prefers, first, that if an Escape Clause is proposed by the American
                            Delegation, it be modelled as closely as practicable on the London Naval
                            Treaty, and, second, that any Escape Clause finally adopted contain some
                            provision for “advice” along the lines of the last clause of Article 21
                            of that Treaty.</p>
                        <p>From this point of view, the alternatives suggested in the telegrams
                            exchanged, beginning with your 23 of November 15, 8 p.m., present

                                    certain that some other delegation will propose the addition of

                                    last paragraph of your 29, November 19, 9 p.m. This would omit
                                    the word “other” and take no account of the objections voiced in
                                    the Department’s 8, November 19, 5 p.m. Department will not
                                    insist on its position in this matter, however, if you are still
                                    convinced that this is the best alternative.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Please report to the Department which of the above four alternatives you
                            finally decide on. In the event that you adopt the second one, we are
                            prepared to approve any Escape Clause resulting from the debate which is
                            similar in substance to any one of the above texts.</p>
                        <p>The Department has purposely avoided using the word “consultation” in its
                            telegrams on this subject and believes that the Delegation had best
                            refrain from using it so far as possible in the discussions, since we do
                            not desire this issue confused with the question of a Consultative
                            Pact.</p>

                        <p>33. We have during the past day or two had several private conversations
                            with delegates concerning the general subject of derogations in an
                            effort to elicit their general views as to how the escape clause can be
                            made most effective and acceptable. We have found that one of their main
                            preoccupations was to reconcile any possible draft with the obstacle
                            constituted for League members by the provision in paragraph 4 of
                            article 8 of the Covenant to the effect that when a disarmament
                            agreement is reached “the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be
                            exceeded without the concurrence of the Council.”</p>
                        <p>We have found a considerable measure of sympathy with our view that an
                            escape clause should be drafted so broadly as to avoid <pb n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0276"/>the defects of an itemized statement of
                            reasons for modification (such as rebellion, menace of aggression,
                            technical development, growth of civilization, et cetera) and to afford
                            reassurance to the signatories in accepting low figures in the knowledge
                            that they can, in the case of real need, modify them so far as strictly
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>In view of the wording of the Covenant above referred to it seems to be
                            generally felt that the best hope of a solution lies in the stipulation
                            that modifications are to be temporary in character, and we have
                            therefore felt justified in inserting language and adding a final
                            paragraph to this effect. We are in full accord as to the analysis given
                            in your 9, November 20, 2 p.m., and after our conversations are
                            confirmed in the belief that the best course is the one indicated by you
                            as first in the order of preference.</p>
                        <p>As various alternative drafts are being submitted for consideration by a
                            special subcommittee which is to meet tomorrow in preparation for
                            general debate which will probably take place Monday, and since there
                            seems to be a general feeling that a draft submitted by us would be most
                            helpful, we are circulating tomorrow a draft of which the following is

                            machinery and the obligations under the Covenant. This situation became
                            so involved that we took occasion to make a statement of our position
                            along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That we had envisaged a Permanent Disarmament Commission designed
                                    to receive, collect, and disseminate information, to follow in a
                                    broad way the progress of disarmament, and to make preliminary
                                    studies for future disarmament conferences. When, however, it
                                    came to giving the Commission actual powers as indicated in the
                                    preceding paragraph we felt bound in frankness to say that we
                                    could not follow their lead.</p>
                                <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0278"/>
                                <p>That we recognized in logic the distinction between the various
                                    classes of violations referred to above but felt that the remedy
                                    should be the same for all and should follow in broad lines the
                                    escape clause we had proposed.</p>
                                <p>That it was not always easy to find a formula that would meet the
                                    preoccupations of both League members and non-League members and
                                    if the subcommittee did not see its way to following along the
                                    path we outlined we suggest that the League members frame the
                                    provisions which would satisfy them. The non-League members
                                    could then consider to what degree and with what modifications
                                    they could adhere to the system proposed.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>A considerable modification of views became apparent in the course of
                            subsequent debate evidently due on the one hand to a growing realization
                            of the impracticability of other alternative drafts, and on the other
                            hand to the growing desire to have us included in the system from the
                            beginning and as will be seen from the text our views appear to have
                            been met in regard to most, at least, of the essentials.</p>
                        <p>In general the text outside of our particular amendment is more detailed
                            and specific than we would have preferred. Indeed from the start it
                            became evident that, opposed to the Anglo-Saxon desire for a brief and
                            simple text which would permit the logical growth of the Permanent
                            Commission through experience, was the rather general desire to foresee
                            every contingency and specify in detail and with rigidity a rigid and
                            binding procedure. In view of the fact that this desire for rigidity was
                            based on apprehension as to the future, the acceptance of broader and
                            simpler views seems to us to constitute a very material concession even
                            though it be in the direction of common sense.</p>
                        <p>Studying the text it would seem that the only article of doubtful
                            acceptability is article ZB dealing with the report to be made by the
                            Commission upon receipt of complaints. We made it clear that we wished
                            to give this article further study. We incline however to the belief
                            that as finally phrased (it having been twice attenuated to meet our
                            special preoccupation) it should present no difficulties particularly as
                            the text remains subject to further modification at the Conference
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The Department will note two or three minor alterations made by the
                            committee in our escape clause, notably that the Permanent Disarmament
                            Commission should be notified of any temporary suspension of the
                            convention together with the reasons therefor at the same time as the
                            other high contracting parties.</p>
                        <p>The provisions of article OA concerning the status of members of the
                            Commission seem somewhat open to criticism. These represent a compromise
                            between the views held by the French and the British delegations. In
                            view of the divergences of views on this point, this <pb n="199"
                                xml:id="pg_199" facs="0279"/>will undoubtedly be reopened at the
                            Conference and meanwhile would not appear of sufficient importance to us
                            to warrant a strong stand as there could in no event be an obligation on
                            the part of the United States to accept membership on the Permanent
                            Disarmament Commission if it did not so desire.</p>
                        <p>These articles will come up for discussion before the full Commission
                            this afternoon or tomorrow and will probably be somewhat modified in
                            text, although there is no reason to foresee that they will not be
                            accepted for their broad outline.</p>
                        <p>We should greatly appreciate it if the Department would permit us to
                            express general approval of the texts outlined, bearing in mind that
                            this is a draft only open to modification and indeed complete review at
                            the final conference. The delegates of the major powers have made very
                            substantial modification of their thesis to meet our views and have
                            shown an earnest desire and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to meet our
                            difficulties. It would have a happy effect if we could express
                            appreciation at the third reading as well as a readiness to take this
                            text as the basis of our discussions at the General Disarmament
                            Conference.</p>

                        <p>45. At the speed at which we are at present progressing the second
                            reading will in all probability be terminated this week. The third
                            reading which is expected to be purely formal will take place presumably
                            early next week, possibly Monday.</p>
                        <p>The text is practically complete on second reading with the exception of
                            a possible provision for revision under restricted circumstances,
                            ratification, and denunciation.</p>
                        <p>These are being prepared and will probably be passed this afternoon or

                            represent the most practical method of stating the resultant views of
                            conflicting schools of thought among 25 delegations. They really should
                            be regarded as constituting a memorandum as a starting point for
                            discussion in the final conference and in no sense as a binding text.
                            This has been repeatedly stated and remains uncontested so that we have
                            not felt it necessary to prolong this session by insistence on perfected
                            drafting such as would be essential for signature.</p>

                        <p>54. A number of general statements will be made at the final session of
                            the Preparatory Commission and there will be an excessive amount of
                            self-congratulation on the results which our draft convention has
                            achieved, if past experience can be relied on. The undue optimism shown
                            in America in regard to the reduction which the London Conference would
                            achieve greatly embarrassed us there, as <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                                facs="0281"/>you will remember. Serious disillusionment, will, we
                            fear, face the American people if they have similar high hopes of the
                            results to be achieved by the General Disarmament Conference, and our
                            failure to inform them of the meager results which are to be expected
                            may consequently be criticized. In order to sound a note of warning as
                            to realities, a step which you may consider advisable, I have prepared a
                            speech which I am sending for your consideration in my telegram No. 55
                            (December 4, 9 p.m.).</p>
                        <p>In paragraph 3 a reference to the concern which some powers have for
                            national security has been inserted in order that French criticism may
                            be disarmed and so that in our attempts to put the final discussions on
                            an honest basis the French may be given an opportunity to cooperate. The
                            quotation from Lincoln has been inserted with the belief that it will
                            have a good effect among those who urge reduction in the United States
                            and on the Continent; we recognize, however, that the Continental press
                            may possibly remove this from its context in an effort to show that
                            Germany’s contention that the Allied Powers have no real intention of
                            reducing armaments is being supported by us. It is important to have
                            your comments or approval at the earliest possible date for the reason
                            that the general statements may come by Saturday of this week.</p>

                        <p>55. Following is draft of speech referred to in my 54, December 4, 7
                            p.m.: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the course of our debates we have heard numerous estimates as
                                    to the value of our work. But it is only now that our
                                    deliberations are coming to an end that we can effectively judge
                                    to what degree we have succeeded in our task.</p>
                                <p>For four years we have been endeavoring to reach an agreement.
                                    There have been long and direct conflicts of opinion; views have
                                    been maintained with vigor; and yet our friendship with those
                                    who have differed from us has grown as steadily and as surely as
                                    our friendship with those who have shared our views. I take this
                                    as a good omen for the spirit in which all the nations will
                                    enter the General Disarmament Conference and try to convert our
                                    text from a theory to a reality.</p>
                                <p>I have, throughout, been sensible of the very real difficulties
                                    under which many members of this Commission have labored.
                                    Overshadowing our discussions, though seldom spoken, have been
                                    the <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0282"/>anxieties and
                                    worries that have arisen from the special preoccupations felt by
                                    numerous governments for their national security.</p>
                                <p>We have now completed a draft convention which, after study by
                                    the Governments, will go forward to the general conference. I
                                    should not be frank if I did not say that this draft falls far
                                    short of our hopes and expectations. It fails to contain many
                                    factors in which we have always believed and which, in our
                                    opinion, would lead to a real reduction of armaments. What we
                                    have achieved does not hold out the promise of bringing about
                                    that immediate reduction of armaments we would like to see. Make
                                    no mistake; it is not my purpose to belittle what we have done.
                                    Although our hopes may thus be disappointed, we can find comfort
                                    in the measure of agreement which has been reached in this
                                    Commission. We can at least foresee a stabilization of
                                    armaments, the setting up of a machinery to receive and
                                    disseminate information on armaments, to educate public opinion,
                                    and to prepare systematically for the work of future
                                    conferences, as successive milestones in the continuing process
                                    of disarmament. If these things can be achieved by the coming
                                    conference, and from present indications I think we are
                                    justified in assuming that they can be achieved, we shall have a
                                    situation obviously better than we have at present and, while we
                                    cannot claim to have built the edifice, we shall at least have
                                    laid the foundation upon which the edifice can be erected.</p>
                                <p>It is possible that the coming conference will accomplish more
                                    than this, but, if so it will be because our labors have been
                                    improved upon and because, after mature study of the problems
                                    involved and after weighing the consequences of failure, the
                                    governments come to the conference resolved on greater measures
                                    of concession than the delegates here have been authorized to
                                    make.</p>
                                <p>I feel that we should be rendering a poor service to the cause of
                                    reduction of armaments if we were to lead our peoples to believe
                                    that this work carried the movement further than it does. We
                                    have been repeatedly told during the past four years of the role
                                    of public opinion in connection with disarmament. It has been
                                    repeatedly said that real achievement by the Conference can be
                                    reached only by an aroused public opinion. This is partly true,
                                    but it is not enough that public opinion be aroused. It is first
                                    of all necessary that it should be informed, for an aroused and
                                    uninformed public opinion may do infinitely more harm than good.
                                    Public opinion will not be informed in such a way as to exercise
                                    an intelligent influence if, through a desire to create
                                    confidence, we adopt too optimistic a tone as to what can be
                                    accomplished on the basis of our present draft. Such
                                    exaggeration can really tend only to lull public opinion into a
                                    false sense of confidence, render it incapable of exercising its
                                    salutary influence, and prepare it for inevitable
                                    disillusionment. Exaggerated statements have their inevitable
                                    reaction because, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ‘you can fool
                                    all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of
                                    the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the
                                    time.’</p>
                                <p>We are all in agreement that an immense amount of preparatory
                                    work remains to be done before the meeting of the General
                                    Conference. The technical preparation for that Conference is in
                                    all conscience great enough; but a more difficult and more
                                    responsible <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0283"/>task lies
                                    ahead of all our governments in informing public opinion as to
                                    the facts, as to the difficulties, and as to the possible
                                    measures which may, with mutual concession, help us toward the
                                    goal we all desire to reach. This end can be served only by
                                    stating our achievements and our difficulties with
                                    moderation.</p>
                                <p>I hope that in separating at the conclusion of our labors we
                                    shall not yield to the temptation to indulge in mutual
                                    congratulation, that we may separate with becoming modesty, and,
                                    on reporting to our various governments, that we do so with a
                                    full and frank recognition of the shortcomings of our present
                                    draft, and of the duties and responsibilities still before our
                                    governments to lead the General Disarmament Conference to the
                                    success which our peoples earnestly desire.”</p>

                            That would probably be the particular bit on which the press would
                            seize, and give rise to statements that American delegation was

                            142.1929.V.), I had the honour to inform you that the Council of the
                            League of Nations had decided in principle that the first Codification
                            Conference, which is to consider the questions of Nationality,
                            Territorial Waters, and the Responsibility of States for Damage caused
                            in their territory to the person or property of foreigners, should meet
                            at The Hague on March 13th, 1930.</p>
                        <p>My letter of July 15th explained the origin of the Conference and the
                            measures which had been taken to prepare for it and gave the list of the
                            Governments which the Council had decided to invite to the Conference,
                            namely:</p>
                        <p>The members of the League, Brazil, Costa Rica, Free City of Danzig,

                            submitted to the Conference, namely:</p>
                        <p>1. Bases of Discussion drawn up by the Preparatory Committee for the

                            above-mentioned three documents to the Council have been printed and

                        <p>In execution of a further decision taken by the Council on September 25th
                            last, I have now the honour, on behalf of the Council, to convey to your
                            Government a formal invitation to be represented at the Conference by a
                            delegation furnished with the full powers necessary to sign such
                            conventions or declarations as the Conference may draw up.</p>
                        <p>I beg to enclose a copy of the report made to the Council on September
                            25th by the representative of Italy and the resolution adopted by the
                            Council (Document C. 480.1929.V.).<note n="94" xml:id="d193fn94"
                                >Enclosure not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>You will observe that the Governments are invited to send to the
                            Conference delegations sufficiently numerous to permit of the three
                            questions on the agenda being discussed simultaneously in the committees
                            appointed by the Conference, and that the Council has requested me
                            specially to call the attention of the Governments to the desirability
                            of appointing without delay their representatives at the Conference,
                            whether plenipotentiary delegates, substitute delegates, or technical
                            delegates, in order that the members of the Conference may be able to
                            make a thorough study of the documentation already assembled.</p>
                        <p>As regards the composition of the delegations, I venture further to call
                            attention to the resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of
                            Nations on September 24th, 1928, in the following terms: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Assembly, considering that the question of nationality which
                                    is on the agenda of the Conference is of special interest to
                                    women, and that Article 7 of the Covenant embodies the principle
                                    that all positions under or in connection with the League shall
                                    be open equally to men and women, expresses the hope that the
                                    Members of the League, when invited to the forthcoming
                                    Conference, will consider <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206"

                                    into account in composing their delegations.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As regards the subjects to be discussed by the Conference, M. Scialoja in
                            his report to the Council thought it desirable to make special mention
                            of the following passage in the second report of the Preparatory
                            Committee: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The suggestion that the Conference should deliberate on the
                                    bases |of discussion prepared by the Preparatory Committee was
                                    also prompted by a desire to facilitate the work of the
                                    Conference. In point of fact these bases of discussion were
                                    furnished by the Governments themselves, which replied to the
                                    requests submitted to them for information. The Committee merely
                                    collated their replies and brought out the points in which they
                                    are in agreement. The individual delegations will, moreover,
                                    have the fullest liberty to submit amendments. The reason why
                                    proposals which do not come within the scope of the bases of
                                    discussion can only be dealt with if this is allowed by a
                                    previous decision is to obviate the necessity for the Conference
                                    to handle questions on which, as a result of the work of the
                                    Committee of Experts and the replies received from Governments,
                                    agreement would appear to be very unlikely. Moreover, the
                                    Conference will have the fullest possible powers to allow any
                                    question to be considered.”</p>

                        <p>Finally, you will observe from the enclosed document that the Council, in
                            agreement with the Assembly, requests those Governments which have not
                            replied to the Preparatory Committee’s questionnaire to be so good as to
                            do so.</p>
                        <p>The Council has appointed as President of the Conference M. Heemskerk,
                            Netherlands Minister of State, former Prime Minister and former Minister

                            from the Secretary General of the League of Nations an invitation dated
                            October 15, 1929, to attend an International Conference to be held at
                            The Hague beginning March 13, 1930, for the purpose of considering the
                            Codification of International Law. The subjects to be taken up at this
                                <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0287"/>Conference are (1)
                            Nationality, (2) Territorial Waters, and (3) Responsibility of States
                            for damage caused in their territory to the person or property of
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Each of these subjects is of great importance in the conduct of the
                            foreign relations of this Government. Troublesome questions of dual
                            nationality are constantly arising in connection with our efforts to
                            protect American citizens abroad. It is frequently found that the
                            persons whom we endeavor to protect or assist, although American
                            citizens under our law by birth, are also regarded as citizens or
                            subjects of the foreign States concerned under their laws. Like
                            difficulties are frequently encountered in the case of naturalized
                            citizens. Several countries do not recognize the expatriation of their
                            nationals by naturalization in foreign countries. The result is that
                            naturalized American citizens, formerly nationals of those countries, on
                            returning to their native lands are still regarded as nationals and
                            frequently find themselves in difficulties under the laws pertaining to
                            military service, taxation, etc. It is, therefore, very desirable that
                            these conflicts between the national laws of the various countries
                            should, in so far as is possible, be reconciled.</p>
                        <p>The question of Territorial Waters is likewise important. The Conference
                            will consider, among other things, the breadth of the territorial waters
                            under the sovereignty of the coastal State; the distance to which the
                            coastal State may exercise authority on the high seas to prevent the
                            infringement within its territory or territorial waters of its customs
                            or sanitary regulations, or interference with its security; the points
                            from which the belt of territorial waters is to be measured; methods by
                            which territorial waters of islands and groups of islands are to be
                            determined; questions pertaining to the right of innocent passage of
                            foreign merchant vessels and of foreign war ships through the
                            territorial waters of a State; the right of local authorities to make
                            arrests on board foreign merchant vessels within or passing through such
                            territorial waters; and the continuation on the high seas of pursuit
                            begun within territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>It will readily be appreciated that, in view of the extent of the coast
                            line of the United States and the magnitude and importance of American
                            shipping, these questions are of vital interest to this Government.</p>
                        <p>The third question, namely, that of Responsibility of States for damage
                            caused in their territory to the person or property of foreigners, is of
                            tremendous importance to this Government. The Conference will consider,
                            among other subjects involving questions of State, responsibility, the
                            repudiation by legislative or executive acts of debts of the State, and
                            failure to comply with obligations resulting from debts; refusal to
                            allow foreigners access to judicial tribunals; <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0288"/>delays on the part of such tribunals,
                            ill-will manifested toward foreigners, and procedure resulting in a
                            miscarriage of justice; acts and omissions of officials, including those
                            of diplomatic and consular officers, and political subdivisions of a
                            State, such as communes, provinces, etc.; acts of armed forces, such as
                            the requisitioning, occupation, and damage to or destruction of
                            property; insurrection, riot, mob violence, and other disturbances; and
                            responsibility of a State entrusted with the conduct of the foreign
                            relations of another State or political unit for damages suffered by
                            foreigners in the territory of the latter State or political unit.</p>
                        <p>In view of the effect upon the conduct of our foreign relations,
                            particularly the protection of American life and property in foreign
                            countries, of conclusions which may be reached at this Conference on the
                            various subjects to be considered, I think it most important that this
                            Government should be represented at the Conference by delegates,
                            technical advisers, and other necessary personnel.</p>
                        <p>I therefore, submit the enclosed draft of a Joint Resolution for which I
                            recommend that the favorable consideration of the Congress be
                                requested.<note n="95" xml:id="d194fn95">Not printed; for text of

                            and I have talked the matter over and I shall have to ask that if at any
                            time there are differences in the delegation where any delegate takes a
                            serious position which is opposed to the position that you and Mr.
                            Hackworth take, it be referred to Washington by telegraph; or, if you
                            and Mr. Hackworth differ on any matter, that that be referred to
                            Washington, and that, I think, will cover all differences. You will know
                            that in some of the subjects at least the Department does not expect

                            Speaking generally, I should think you would expect Mr. Flournoy to

                        <p>37. [From Miller.] Conference No. 5. After one week of the daily meetings
                            of each of the three committees I think the result to date may be
                            generally summarized as follows: The progress made has been very limited
                            and slow as the discussions have been confined to a few principles in
                            each committee. In territorial waters, unless the three Magyar [<hi
                                rend="italic">three-mile?</hi>] states admit an exception for such
                            countries as Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Portugal, any agreement seems
                            remote. In responsibility of states, any general agreement if reached
                            would be of very small scope. In nationality, I see almost no chance of
                            an agreement. Our policy for the right of expatriation is opposed by a
                            majority and I cannot now see any compromise form of formula which we
                            could accept in view of the act of 1868.<note n="1" xml:id="d198fn1">15
                                Stat. 223.</note> Furthermore the vital difference in this subject
                            between France and Italy is one of real political importance which
                            cannot be met in a general convention. The foregoing were my views prior
                            to a talk I had last evening with Giannini, chief Italian delegate, and
                            are confirmed by that interview. There will be a strong effort made this
                            week to speed up work of Conference and there is great pressure to end
                            by April 12 and no earlier date seems now possible. Miller.</p>

                        <p>There is not the slightest possibility that the Conference will adopt the
                            proposal of the National Woman’s Party as a clause of a convention.<note

                                Commission of Women. The Commission was created pursuant to a
                                resolution of the Sixth International Conference of American States,
                                Habana, 1928.</note> herself has stated. Under the circumstances the
                            obvious course, which the women have in mind, is for them to seek a
                            resolution or recommendation of the Conference which would be favorable
                            to the proposal; our attitude on such a resolution, of course, would be
                            one of great importance. In talking with Miss Stevens I reserved any
                            answer on the point. I think that the Chilean delegation, which has
                            brought forward the proposal, would be disposed to accept any suggestion
                            which we may make in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I suggest following as form of such a resolution:<note n="4"

                            is our feeling that questions relating to children and their interests
                            are closely bound up with the complete application of the principle and

                            now before the commission on nationality. These seventeen articles
                            represent almost exactly the definitive text adopted by a two-thirds

                            are or will be proposed and the text of which I do not now transmit.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The major question of policy is our attitude toward the prestige [<hi
                                rend="italic">protocol?</hi>] of convention containing the seventeen
                            substantive articles above mentioned as well as the other general
                            articles.… Of course it would be possible for the United States to sign
                            this convention and by preferring reservations to cut out, so far as we
                            are concerned, all the objectionable features. I do not favor that
                            course.</p>
                        <p>The proposed convention does little toward the removal of dual
                            nationality or the prevention of statelessness. Our policy of
                            expatriation receives no recognition at all. I think that we should
                            refuse to sign the convention and make a statement to the effect that
                            while the discussions have been very valuable and helpful, the
                            convention as proposed contains a number of features which the United
                            States could not accept and while it contains certain clauses to which
                            we have no objection an acceptance of these by the United States would
                            involve such extensive reservations to the agreement as a whole that we
                            consider it better to await a further and more progressive agreement
                            which we hoped the discussion of the present Conference would
                            facilitate.</p>
                        <p>Hackworth, Risley, and Mrs. Shipley concur. Flournoy asked me to add this
                            expression of his views with which the rest of us do not agree.</p>
                        <p>Flournoy thinks that article 1 is useful and that, with reference to
                            statements in articles 3 and 4 and other articles concerning double
                            nationality, a reservation to the effect that the United States cannot
                            admit that a person who obtains naturalization in the United States
                            retains his former allegiance, would sufficiently safeguard the position
                            of our Government. He believes that as the articles of the convention so
                            far agreed to are inadequate it would be desirable to recommend that the
                            signing of any convention be postponed until further consideration shall
                            have been given by all concerned. However, if it is decided that a
                            convention shall be signed, he thinks that it would be preferable for us
                            to sign with reservations thus getting the advantage of the articles of
                            which we approve. Miller.</p>

                        <p>49. From Miller. Conference No. 17.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>… One of the general clauses adopted Saturday night permits signature
                            until December 31, 1930, but even so I think it better to say at this
                            Conference that we will not sign. The objections are obvious now and we
                            might as well make our position clear. A new and to my mind fatal
                            objection to the whole convention is that the committee Saturday night
                            voted down a clause permitting future special agreements on nationality
                            between particular states. It is quite impossible for us to tie our
                            hands in this regard by any general convention.</p>
                        <p>I shall not cable the general clauses at length unless you wish as they
                            are pages long and mostly are not material on the question of signature.
                            Some of them are not yet definitive.</p>

                        <p>50. [From Miller.] Conference No. 18. I think the general result of this
                            Conference will be a set-back to the whole idea of the codification of
                            international law; this opinion is subject to revision but it expresses
                            my views at the moment.</p>
                        <p>In nationality, the agreement reached will be very limited and if you
                            agree with our views it will be one which the United States will never
                            sign.</p>
                        <p>In responsibility, any agreement will be quite limited in any case and
                            even such a limited agreement is not now definitely in sight. This is
                            the only one of the three subjects which presents primarily questions of
                            existing international law for codification.</p>
                        <p>In territorial waters, there appears no possibility of agreement with
                            views more openly divergent than they were when discussions
                            commenced.</p>
                        <p>There is this much to be said on the other side.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>The difficulties on all three questions have been explored and have been
                            found to have been more real than was supposed when the Governments
                            agreed on this Conference. The study of the three questions and the
                            interchange of views will be valuable regardless of the present result
                            and may perhaps lead gradually to some result later on some points
                            although more probably in the near future along the lines of particular
                            conventions than by general agreement. Miller.</p>

                        <p>53. Conference number 21. From Miller. At commission on territorial
                            waters April 7, I proposed that the commission abandon all idea of a
                            signed convention and submit to the Governments for their future
                            consideration and study a report of the studies and deliberations of the
                            commission; that action will be followed. There will be no convention or
                            draft convention on territorial waters but merely a report of the
                            commission which will contain an account of the proceedings, the points
                            of agreement and of difference and drafts of certain articles
                            provisionally agreed upon and hoping for a further conference on the
                            subject in the future.</p>

                        <p>54. From Miller. Conference 22. The commission on nationality has adopted
                            the following recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1. The Conference is unanimously of the opinion that it is very desirable
                            that the various states should, in the exercise of their power of
                            regulating questions of nationality, make every effort to reduce so far
                            as possible cases of statelessness and that the League of Nations should
                            continue the work which it already has in hand for the purpose of
                            arriving at an international settlement of this serious question.</p>
                        <p>2. The Conference is also unanimous in declaring that it is very
                            desirable that the various states should, in the exercise of their power
                            of regulating questions of nationality, make every effort to reduce so
                            far as possible cases of dual nationality and that steps should be taken
                            by the League of Nations to prepare the way for a settlement by
                            international agreement of the various conflicts which arise from the
                            possession by individuals of two or more nationalities.</p>
                        <p>In particular it is recommended that the various states adopt legislation
                            designed to facilitate renunciation by persons born with dual
                            nationality of the countries in which they are not residing and that
                            such renunciation be not made subject to the fulfillment of unnecessary
                            conditions. The wording of the second paragraph of the foregoing
                            recommendation is provisional.</p>
                        <p>3. It is desirable that states should give effect to the principle that
                            the acquisition of a foreign nationality through naturalization involves
                            the loss of the previous nationality.</p>
                        <p>At the same time so long as the principle is not universally applied it
                            is desirable that before conferring their nationality by naturalization,
                            states should endeavor to ascertain that the person concerned has
                            fulfilled, or [is] in a position to fulfill, the conditions required by
                            the law of his country for loss of nationality.</p>
                        <p>4. The Conference recommends to the Governments the study of the question
                            whether it would not be possible: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>To introduce into their law the principle of the equality of
                                    the sexes in matters of nationality, taking particularly into
                                    consideration the interests of the children, and</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Especially to decide that in principle the nationality of the
                                    wife should not be affected without her consent either by the
                                    mere fact of marriage or by any change in the nationality of her
                                    husband.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>5. The Conference is of the opinion that a woman who in consequence of
                            her marriage has lost her nationality without acquiring that of her
                            husband, should be able to obtain a passport from the state of which her
                            husband is a national.</p>
                        <p>6. (Very tentatively adopted.) The Conference recommends to the
                            Governments the study of the question whether it would not be desirable
                                <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0296"/>that in the case of a
                            person losing his nationality without acquiring another the state whose
                            nationality he last possessed shall at the request of the country where
                            he is residing and under certain conditions admit him to its
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>7. The Conference, with the view of facilitating the progressive
                            codification of international law, expresses the [understanding?] that,
                            in the future, states shall be guided as far as possible by the
                            provisions of the acts of the first Conference for the Codification of
                            International Law in any special conventions which they may conclude
                            amongst themselves.</p>
                        <p>8. The first Conference for the Codification of International Law draws
                            attention to the advisability of examining at a future conference
                            questions connected with the proof of nationality. It would be highly
                            desirable to determine the legal value of certificates of nationality
                            which have been, or may be, issued by the competent authorities, and to
                            lay down the conditions for their recognition by other states.</p>
                        <p>My comments on the foregoing recommendations follow: <list>
                                <item>To numbers 1, 2, 6 and 8, I see no objection.</item>
                                <item>Number 3. The first paragraph is in accord with our policy but
                                    I object very strongly to the second paragraph which in effect
                                    nullifies the first. In my opinion we could never accept and
                                    consequently cannot accept the recommendation.</item>
                                <item>Number 4. Clause (1) is our proposal. As to clause (2), there
                                    is at least some doubt in view of the provisions of the Cable
                                        Act<note n="10" xml:id="d205fn10">42 Stat. 1021.</note>
                                    regarding loss of nationality of a woman marrying an ineligible
                                    alien. However, the recommendation only recommends study of the
                                    question, and in view of clause (1), which we proposed, and in
                                    view also of the fact that clause (2) raises a very delicate
                                    question, it is my view that we should accept number 4.</item>
                                <item>Number 5. I oppose as we cannot issue passports to persons not
                                    owing allegiance.</item>
                                <item>Number 7. Necessarily I object to this as the general
                                    convention, which is one of the acts of the Conference, is
                                    unacceptable to us.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The question remains whether any statement should be made regarding these
                            recommendations when they come before the plenary session of the
                            Conference where they can be adopted by a majority vote. I think that a
                            statement should be made opposing numbers 3 and 7 and that we should
                            merely vote against number 5.</p>
                        <p>All our delegates concur.</p>

                        <p>55. From Miller. Conference number 23. The commission on nationality has
                            adopted a protocol to be annexed to the general convention and
                            consisting of the following three articles: <list>
                                <label>Article 1.</label>
                                <item>A person possessing two or more nationalities who habitually

                                    and [who] is in fact most closely connected with that country,
                                    will be exempt from all military obligations in the other
                                    country or countries.</item>

                        <p>I make the following comments on foregoing protocols:</p>
                        <p>Annexed protocol of three articles. So far as these provide for exemption
                            from military service they are desirable. But there are two serious
                            objections to them: (1) Article 1 and 2 by implication, and article 3,
                            expressly admit dual nationality of naturalized citizens which we
                            strongly oppose; (2) an annexed protocol is closely bound up with the
                            general convention. It is possible to meet at least the first objection
                            and perhaps the second by appropriate reservations. I think that we
                            should take the course here of not signing the protocol but saying that
                            it will be considered by our Government.</p>
                        <p>Flournoy thinks it preferable to sign here with reservations as he
                            believes article 1 of great practical value.</p>
                        <p>Annexed protocol of one article. This is of no particular interest to us
                            although there is a conceivable case where it might apply to an American
                            mother in another country who had two nationalities. However, the
                            objection that it is an annexed protocol and so connected with the
                            general convention seems to me conclusive.</p>
                        <p>A special separate protocol. I oppose this as I think we would be worse
                            off with such qualifications in returning undesirable aliens than we are
                            now. All our delegates concur.</p>

                        <p>I have had considerable doubt as to the point Flournoy raises; but
                            because of considerable criticism going on here by a certain group of
                            women, I should prefer that there be no signing of conventions at all at
                            The Hague and prefer to have our Government’s signature affixed, if at
                            all, after you return. I am aware that this course may mean that other
                            nations will not be following your example by signing promptly, but I
                            regard that difficulty as unavoidable.</p>

                        <p>60. [From Miller.] Conference 28. The question as to our signature of the
                            document called the Final Act of the Conference is now presented for
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The Final Act will be a formal and quite summary statement of the
                            proceedings of the Conference reciting the invitation, the names of the
                            delegates, the officers of the Conference and the three commissions;
                            then will follow a list of the conventions drawn up mentioning them only
                            by title and a reference to the reports on territorial waters and
                            responsibility; then a statement that the Conference had adopted various
                            resolutions which will be set forth <hi rend="italic">in extenso;</hi>
                            and finally a <hi rend="italic">testimonium</hi> clause.</p>
                        <p>The Final Act has not yet been written but I think the foregoing is a
                            correct statement of the substance of the document.</p>
                        <p>In any case there will be nothing in the Final Act which will be in any
                            sense of a contractual nature. It is intended merely as a formal and
                            official record of the proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Both Hackworth and I feel strongly that the United States should sign the
                            Final Act and we recommend we should be authorized accordingly. The
                            United States has taken a prominent part in the proceedings here and
                            sometimes a decisive part and it seems, to us, particularly in view of
                            the small result of the Conference as a whole, that it would be a great
                            pity if we refused to sign a document that is merely a record and binds
                            nobody to anything.</p>
                        <p>If you agree in principle with our recommendation I shall have to ask
                            that will you not include also discretion to us regarding the form of
                            the Final Act. The signature of that document is now set for Saturday
                            afternoon April 12 and I doubt if it will be at all possible for me to
                            telegraph you its text even in skeleton form in time for you to answer
                            before the hour of signature.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly I hope you will find it possible to instruct us upon receipt
                            of this telegram.</p>
                        <p>All our delegates concur. Miller.</p>

                        <p>32. For Miller. The organized feminine lobby has persuaded a large part
                            of the Foreign Affairs Committees and their leaders publicly to express
                            the view that the United States should attempt to get a postponement of
                            any convention on nationality in the same way that you expect to
                            postpone as to the other topics. As you fully understand I have never
                            thought that any of these subjects was ready for world codification and
                            have never expected a satisfactory convention. We would prefer not to
                            see a great majority of the other nations crystallize their views on
                            nationality in a way which we do not approve. We cannot of course
                            attempt for a moment to dictate the views of other nations as to whether
                            or not they deem it wise to enter into conventions but I think you might
                            express the view that we deem it unwise that the conference should
                            attempt in any degree to legislate on questions where there is real
                            conflict of opinion.</p>

                                xml:id="d212fn2">Telegram No. 65; not printed.</note> the United
                            States delegation voted against the convention as a whole; we were the
                            only delegation that voted against it.</p>
                        <p>At one of the commission’s previous meetings when convention was voted on
                            article by article, the delegation with my express approval and
                            direction voted in favor of articles 10 and 11, quoted above, which then
                            had different numbers. Before that vote was taken the delegation had
                            offered amendments to the two articles which would have made them
                            general in language; as, for example, saying in No. 10:<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d212fn3">Quoted passage not paraphrased.</note>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Naturalization of one spouse during marriage does not of itself

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The amendments had been rejected by the commission, so it seemed to me
                            not only proper but desirable that the United States should vote
                            affirmatively on the two articles quoted above. That naturalization of a
                            husband shall not automatically and without the consent of the wife
                            bring about her naturalization is wholly in accord with <pb n="222"
                                xml:id="pg_222" facs="0302"/>United States law and policy. That a

                            accordance with law is also wholly in accord with United States law and
                            policy. In my view it was impossible for the United States to vote
                            against such proposals. I was quite aware that Miss Stevens wanted me to
                            vote against them and I refused to do so because I refused to put the
                            United States in position to have it said that we supported views that
                            consent of wife in either of two cases which I mentioned was necessary.
                            To say that this Government should vote against such proposals merely
                            because their language in terms does not apply to both sexes when we all
                            know that in practical application and in fact only one sex is concerned
                            would be to make a fetish of words. I fully believe that my action was
                            right, and in accordance with your views. As you know, the Conference
                            has acted on the nationality question. On the point, however, that we
                            should have attempted to prevent the adoption here of any convention at
                            all, it is quite obvious that any such attempt would have been
                            fruitless. At an international conference the United States is not in
                            the position of a dictator and the vote last night of 40 to 1 on this
                            convention shows in itself what were the views of the other countries
                            including all the other great powers except Russia.</p>
                        <p>The views of the United States on expatriation and married women, the
                            subjects which I regard as the two major issues, were put before the
                            Conference here definitely and very strongly—the first in my declaration
                            on expatriation which had Department’s approval;<note n="14"

                            opposition to our policy. I believe, on the contrary, that discussions
                            here have shown that world sentiment on the whole question of
                            nationality is in state of flux and that the trend is our way despite
                            fact that at this time various countries have other views which are
                            based partly on social and economic conditions and partly on religion.

                        <p>73. [From Miller.] Conference 38. There were two plenary sessions of the
                            Conference on April 12.<note n="16" xml:id="d213fn16">League of Nations,

                            of the commission on the territorial waters was received. There were
                            then adopted without dissent three recommendations: The first related to
                            future work of codification; the second to the international régime of
                            ports; the third to the protection of products of the sea.</p>
                        <p>All of these appear to be harmless and I shall not cable their text in
                            full unless you request it.</p>
                        <p>The afternoon session was devoted to the signing of five documents
                            namely: The nationality convention; protocol relating to military
                            obligations; protocol relating to case of statelessness; special
                            protocol relating to statelessness; and the Final Act of the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Of course we signed neither the convention nor any one of the protocols.
                            After consideration we thought the form of the Final Act proper and
                            constituting merely a formal record and in no way binding as an
                            agreement in any sense. Accordingly the Final Act was signed on behalf
                            of the United States by our four delegates,<note n="17"

                            “it is desirable that the terms of the Covenant of the League should not
                            accord any longer to members of the League a right to have recourse to
                            war in cases in which that right has been renounced by the provisions of
                            the Pact of Paris.”</p>
                        <p>The Committee produced a report dated March 8th 1930,<note n="28"

                            been discussed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and it
                            has been decided to instruct the British Delegation at the next Assembly
                            of the League of Nations, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’s
                            Governments in the Dominions, to support the inclusion of the proposed
                            amendments in the Covenant. This decision was brought to the notice of
                            the Secretary of State of the United States by His Majesty’s Principal
                            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in a letter dated April 8th,<note

                        <p>From page 10 of the report it will be observed that amongst other
                            amendments the Committee proposed the addition of a new paragraph to
                            Article 15 of the Covenant, entitled paragraph 7 bis. The effect of this
                            new paragraph is to provide that in a dispute likely to lead to a
                            rupture the Council of the League of Nations may <hi rend="italic">by a
                                majority</hi> ask for an advisory opinion on any point of law

                            be asked for by unanimity.</p>

                            the Permanent Court of International Justice it is stated that: “With
                            regard to requesting an advisory opinion of the Court in any case
                            covered by <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0313"/>the preceding
                            paragraphs, there shall be attributed to an objection of the United
                            States the same force and effect as attaches to a vote against asking
                            for an opinion given by a Member of the League of Nations in the Council
                            or the Assembly.”</p>
                        <p>The effect of the adoption by the Assembly of the new paragraph to
                            Article 15 of the Covenant will be to diminish the power of Members of
                            the League to prevent an advisory opinion from the Court being
                            requested, and will therefore similarly diminish the power of the United
                            States in this respect, because if the paragraph is adopted the United
                            States will not be able, as they would be if the proposed paragraph is
                            rejected, to block any such request being made to the Court, seeing that
                            the matter will be decided by a majority and not by unanimity.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government are therefore anxious to ascertain whether the
                            insertion of the proposed new paragraph 7 bis in Article 15 is likely
                            adversely to affect the prospects of the Senate of the United States
                            accepting the Protocol of Accession of the United States to the
                            Permanent Court of International Justice. Although His Majesty’s
                            Government have decided to support the inclusion of the proposed
                            amendments in the Covenant, the proposed new paragraph 7 bis can well be
                            omitted without affecting the rest of the amendments, and should
                            objection be taken to it in the United States, His Majesty’s Government
                            would for their part be disposed to move that the new paragraph 7 bis
                            should not be accepted.</p>

                            there existed no provision in the Covenant specifically empowering the

                            unanimous vote. The adoption of an amendment to the Covenant
                            specifically providing that the Council may request an advisory opinion
                            from the Court by majority rather than unanimous vote in cases arising
                            under Article 15, would effect a fundamental change in the situation
                            which existed at the time the Senate reservations were formulated, as
                            well as at the time the Protocol of Accession of the United States to

                        <p>I handed Mr. Campbell, Counselor of the British Embassy, a memorandum in
                            reply to a memorandum which the Ambassador left with the Secretary of
                            State on May 22, 1930, on the subject of the amendments to the Covenant
                            of the League of Nations, concerning unanimity of the majority of the
                            requests for advisory opinions. I pointed out to him that the point of
                            the memorandum was that any such alteration of the Covenant would change
                            the conditions under which the reservations of the Senate to the
                            Protocol of Signature of the Statute of the World Court were made and
                            that this was our only observation in the matter, as we did not, under
                            any circumstances, wish to interfere with any action the members of the
                            League of Nations might care to take with respect to altering the
                            Covenant. I told him that I felt that the matter should not be given
                            undue publicity and that the United States would not, under any
                            circumstances, wish to be put in the position of preventing the League
                            from carrying out its wishes in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell said he understood fully and would report the matter

                            was ratified by the Swiss Federal Chambers on February 25, 1930. This
                            took the form of the approval of two decrees, the one putting the
                            convention into force insofar as Switzerland is concerned for fifteen
                            years, the other prolonging the terms of the convention for the life of
                            the Bank. This second decree is subject to a referendary delay which
                            expires on May 27; except for the improbable event of a demand for a
                            national referendum, final <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0315"

                            Consulate’s despatch No. 329 dated February 4, 1930,<note n="35"
                                xml:id="d222fn35">Not printed.</note> requesting instructions
                            regarding the <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0316"/>attitude of the
                            Consulate toward the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
                        <p>The establishment at Basel of so important an institution as the Bank for
                            International Settlements will make it a particular duty of the Consul
                            there to study the Bank and its operations; it may make it possible for
                            the Consulate to submit valuable economic and political reports; the
                            Consul will naturally maintain the most cordial possible relations with
                            the Bank, its officers, directors and personnel; however, the Consul is
                            charged with no special mission toward the Bank and should avoid any
                            attitude which might be misconstrued as evidencing such a mission.</p>
                        <p>The Department has hitherto designated an officer as an Acting American
                            Observer with the Reparation Commission; the Bank succeeds to some of
                            the functions of the Reparation Commission, but not in a way that will
                            admit of the participation of Government representatives in its
                            activities. The United States is not a party to the international
                            agreements pursuant to which the Bank is founded, nor will it have
                            contractual relations with the Bank such as will be established between
                            the Bank and several other governments by the Trust Agreement (Annex

                        <p>In some respects the position of the Consulate will not be dissimilar
                            from that of the other Consulates at Basel. As stated in the preamble to
                            the Constituent Charter of the Bank, the Bank is founded by Central
                            Banks pursuant to a Plan<note n="39" xml:id="d222fn39">See Great
                                Britain, Cmd. 3343 (1929): <hi rend="italic">Report of the Committee

                            Powers signatory to The Hague Agreement of January 1930. The Plan (Young
                            Plan, paragraph 148) “recommended the creation of the Bank for
                            International Settlements in order to provide machinery for the removal
                            of the Reparation obligation from the political to the financial
                            sphere.” The Plan states (paragraph 72) that “the <pb n="237"
                                xml:id="pg_237" facs="0317"/>Bank excludes from its procedure all
                            political influences” and again (paragraph 54) “its organization will be
                            outside the field of political influences.” The British Chancellor of
                            the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons February 20, 1930: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“While His Majesty’s Government welcome the creation of the Bank
                                    for International Settlements, it is, as I have previously
                                    stated, a non-political institution, and national Governments
                                    will not be concerned with the direction of the policy of the
                                    Board. Neither the action of individual directors, nor the
                                    action of a Central Bank under Article 20 of the Statutes
                                    requires the prior approval of the Treasury of the country to
                                    which the director of the Central Bank belongs.… There will be
                                    no Treasury representatives at Basel.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In view of these antecedents and of the traditions of the Central Banks
                            represented on the Board of Directors of the Bank, the Consul should
                            avoid over-ambitious initiatives in informing himself regarding its
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>It is not known what reports the Bank will issue regarding its
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>It is presumed that on mere request, the Bank will furnish the Consulate
                            in a routine way, such information and notices as it makes available
                            generally to other consulates and information agencies in Basel. While
                            such routine information will probably receive wide publicity, the
                            Department, and other Departments in Washington, will wish to build up
                            files of information on the Bank which should include the texts of the
                            more important formal announcements which the Consulate can make
                            available. The Consul will, of course, not refuse such additional
                            economic information as comes to him, with due regard to the
                            proprieties, through personal contacts in view of the known interest of
                            the United States Consular Service in economic reporting.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the desire of the founders of the Bank to minimize political
                            influences, it is obvious that the operations of the Bank, and
                            particularly the annual election of Directors, will not be devoid of
                            international political interest. The Consul’s opportunities for
                            observation and study may enable him to render reports in this regard
                            which will be of interest both to the Department and to its several
                            missions.</p>
                        <p>The Consulate should address its despatches and reports regarding the
                            International Bank to the Legation at Berne, which will forward them to
                            the Department and provide for their further distribution through the
                            European Information Center at Paris and assure the Consulate the
                            reciprocal delivery of information from other European missions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to inform you that the
                            Council of the League of Nations decided at its meeting on January 14th,
                            1930, to convene for Monday, February 17th, 1930, at 11 a.m. at Geneva,
                            the Conference contemplated in the first part of the Tenth Assembly’s
                            resolution dealing with the economic work of the League (A.68.
                                1929.II).<note n="41" xml:id="d223fn2">Not reprinted.</note></p>
                        <p>The object of this Conference is defined in the resolution, which states
                            that “in order that this concerted action may be pursued on a firm basis
                            and in an atmosphere of confidence, the Assembly recommends that States
                            which are prepared to participate therein should agree not to increase
                            their protective tariffs above the present level for a period of from
                            two to three years, or to impose new protective duties or create new
                            impediments to trade.” It therefore recommends “the establishment, if
                            necessary, of a programme of subsequent negotiations for facilitating
                            economic relations by all practicable means and especially by reducing
                            hindrances to trade”.</p>
                        <p>As the representative of Germany pointed out in his report to the last
                            session of the Council, the Assembly defined its ideas concerning the
                            character of the conference in the following paragraph of its
                            resolution: “no effective action will be possible in the future unless
                            the Governments are now requested to examine in their turn the questions
                            left in suspense by the Consultative Committee and by the Economic
                            Committee, availing themselves of the work accomplished by those
                            Committees to assist them in their decisions”. In the report introducing
                            the resolution the Assembly expressed “the conviction that negotiations
                            for an economic <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> must not be left
                            entirely in the hands of technical experts, but that, on the contrary,
                            it is essential for Governments to participate more directly than they
                            have hitherto done”.</p>

                                <p>“The Acting Secretary of State of the United States of America
                                    has received, with appreciation, the note of the Secretary
                                    General of the League of Nations, dated January 18, 1930, with
                                    which he was good enough to enclose the report on the economic
                                    work of the League of Nations (Document A.68.1929.II) and a copy
                                    of the report submitted to the Council of the League by the <hi

                                    was approved by the Council at its meeting on January 14, 1930
                                    (Annex to C. L. 9.1930.II), and with which the Secretary General
                                    conveyed the information that the Council of the League of
                                    Nations had decided, at its meeting on January 14, 1930, to
                                    convene at Geneva on February 17, 1930, the Conference
                                    contemplated in the first part of the Tenth Assembly’s
                                    resolution dealing with the economic work of the League.</p>
                                <p>The American Government notes that the object of this Conference
                                    is defined in the resolution, which states that ‘in order that
                                    this concerted action may be pursued on a firm basis and in an
                                    atmosphere of confidence, the Assembly recommends that States
                                    which are prepared to participate therein should agree not to
                                    increase their protective tariffs above the present level for a
                                    period of from two to three years, or to impose new protective
                                    duties or create new impediments <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240"
                                        facs="0320"/>to trade.’ The American Government likewise
                                    notes that the resolution of the Tenth Assembly recommends ‘the
                                    establishment, if necessary, of a programme of subsequent
                                    negotiations for facilitating economic relations by all
                                    practicable means and especially by reducing hindrances to
                                    trade.’</p>
                                <p>The American Government views with approbation any endeavor to
                                    facilitate world-wide economic relations and to remove
                                    discriminatory economic measures and has, with this object,
                                    signed and ratified the Convention for the Abolition of Import
                                    and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions<note n="44"

                                    has cooperated with other international activities looking to
                                    the betterment of economic conditions throughout the world. The
                                    Government of the United States does not feel, however, that it
                                    could at this time usefully participate in the Conference to
                                    which the Secretary General’s note makes reference.</p>
                                <p>The American Government will, nevertheless, follow with
                                    sympathetic interest any action which may be taken by the States
                                    participating in this Conference to promote by
                                    non-discriminatory measures their economic welfare.”</p>

                        <p>Please inform the Secretary General that Mr. Edwin C. Wilson, First
                            Secretary attached to the American Embassy at Paris, has been instructed
                            to be present in Geneva during the period of the Conference and to
                            associate himself with the American Consulate at Geneva with a view to
                            obtaining information regarding the developments of the Conference. At
                            the same time you will request his good offices that the Conference
                            authorities may understand the nature of Mr. Wilson’s duties and may
                            afford to him such facilities as may be practicable.</p>

                            to Geneva at such a time as may be convenient to you prior to the

                            morning of February 17, 1930, and to remain at Geneva during the period
                            of the Conference and for such a time following the Conference as you
                            may find necessary for completing inquiries and preparing reports to the

                        <p>The Department desires that at Geneva you associate yourself with the
                            Consulate assuming charge of the political and economic work of <pb
                                n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0321"/>the Consulate insofar as it
                            relates to the Conference and cognate matters. Consul Everett is being
                            instructed to render you full assistance in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Department’s note declines the League’s invitation to be
                            represented at this Conference, your “association with the Consulate”,
                            as well as its serving practical ends, is designed to forestall possible
                            interpretation of your duties as those of an “official observer”.</p>
                        <p>The Department attaches great importance to this Conference, not so much
                            because it is likely to lead to any immediate results in line with its
                            announced agenda, as because it is regarded as the first step in a
                            possible reorientation of European trade and tariff policy of vital
                            concern to American commercial and financial interests. It is thought,
                            on this account, that private expressions of opinion from responsible
                            individual delegates as to present and prospective trends in European
                            economic policy may be fully as significant as any formal action which
                            the Conference itself may determine. You should report fully to the
                            Department your observations and all developments of importance,
                            especially those affecting American interests. Reference is made to
                            Diplomatic Serial No. 886, December 5, 1929.<note n="46"

                        <p>In this connection, the Department leaves to your discretion entirely the
                            extent to which you will go in attending sessions of the Conference and
                            in establishing relations with the delegates. The Department, however,
                            perceives no objection to your entering into extensive and frank
                            relations with the delegates at the Conference with the natural
                            limitation that it does not desire to be placed in the position of
                            taking part, and you should, of course, take due care that nothing which
                            you may say be interpreted as commitments on the part of this
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>From Wilson. The question of principal interest to the United States
                            which is being discussed here seems to me clearly to be that concerning
                            the effect of multilateral economic agreements upon the
                            most-favored-nation clause in bilateral treaties. The following is a
                            summary of the position of the question in the light of discussions in
                            subcommittees and private conversations:</p>
                        <p>There is general acceptance of the view that existing rights based on the
                            most-favored-nation clause cannot be affected or modified <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0322"/>without the consent of the parties
                            concerned. Thus it was agreed to make no attempt to restrict the
                            advantages of the tariff truce convention, if one should be adopted
                            here, to signatory states only. As regards the future, there is a
                            division of opinion. On the one side, the Belgians, French, Dutch, Swiss
                            and Germans hold that the application of the most-favored-nation clause
                            in an unrestricted and unconditional form constitutes a serious obstacle
                            to the economic work of the League as regards the conclusion of
                            collective agreements. They desire that future commercial treaties
                            should contain a provision excluding from the effect of the
                            most-favored-nation clause the advantages of multilateral conventions of
                            a general character concluded under the auspices of the League of
                            Nations and open to all countries (for example, see article 2 of treaty
                            between France and Switzerland of July 8, 1929,<note n="47"
                                xml:id="d226fn47">League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">cxiv</hi>, p. 189.</note> and article 1 of
                            treaty between the Belgo-Luxemburg and Switzerland of August 26,
                                1929<note n="48" xml:id="d226fn48"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>,
                                vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">cv</hi>, p. 9.</note>). They also favor
                            the modification in this sense, by mutual agreement, of existing
                            most-favored-nation treaties as has been done by Belgium and Holland in
                            an exchange of letters in January 1930. On the other side, Great
                            Britain, Italy and Norway oppose any limitation on the
                            most-favored-nation clause and insist that no recommendation in this
                            sense should be made by the present Conference but that on the contrary
                            every state must be left free to decide its own policy in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, the question is being discussed in a moderate manner. Even
                            those states which hold the problem lies at the heart of the future
                            economic work of the League appear to recognize that they have nothing
                            to gain by trying to force the acceptance of their idea and that they
                            must leave each state free to decide the question according to its own
                            interests. They will, however, of course continue to urge at every
                            appropriate occasion the adoption of the restrictive clause referred to
                            above.</p>

                        <p>In the past two weeks there has been a consistent whittling down of the
                            obligations originally contemplated in the two main documents. The
                            commercial convention follows in general the main lines mentioned in my
                            telegrams of March 10, 11 a.m., and March 17, 11 a.m.,<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d227fn50">Neither printed.</note> but has been weakened all
                            along the line. It was signed yesterday by eleven countries including
                            Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy and will remain open for
                            signature until April 15th. A conference will be held in November of
                            states which have ratified in order to determine whether and when it is
                            to come into force.</p>
                        <p>The protocol regarding future negotiations recommends that the states
                            represented at the Conference reply as soon as possible to a
                            questionnaire concerning methods of improving trade in agricultural and
                            manufactured products and the movement of European raw materials; the
                            economic organization will formulate proposals based on these replies to
                            be submitted as early as possible for the examination of the Governments
                            on the basis of replies from the Governments; the League Council will
                            draw up the subsequent procedure. Until a few days ago fixed and early
                            dates had been laid down for the various stages. However, at the last
                            minute the French and Italian delegations against the opposition of the
                            British insisted that the Governments should not be obliged to take
                            action under the protocol until parliaments had first ratified the
                            commercial convention and that the subsequent procedure should be left
                            to the League Council in order to avoid holding conference of mediocre
                            success such as the present one. In addition to the foregoing proposal
                            for future negotiations, the protocol also recommends action on many
                            questions dealt with by the 1927 Economic Conference and now under
                            examination by the economic organization.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman in his final speech stressed the European character of the
                            Conference, pointed out that its results represent not the work of the
                            League but of the Governments themselves, and said that future
                            developments from this “first hesitating step” will obviously depend
                            upon the spirit in which it will be regarded and executed.</p>

                        <p>The Second International Conference on Concerted Economic Action convened
                            yesterday with 26 European countries sending delegates and 6 overseas
                            countries represented by observers. The Conference first considered the
                            question of the coming into force of the commercial convention of March
                            24, 1930. Of the 9 countries which have so far ratified this convention,
                            none apparently was willing to put it into effect among themselves. In
                            view of the impending ratification of France and Italy, the Conference
                            will probably decide to extend the date when ratifications may be
                            received and postpone fixing the time of the coming into force of this
                            convention until the January meeting of the Conference. Conference now
                            considering position of countries with reference to the protocol of
                            future negotiations, particularly the replies made to the questionnaire
                            attached thereto.</p>

                        <p>Economic Conference ended this morning. In view of uncertainties present
                            in the Conference, it has seemed expedient to defer reporting until the

                        <p>Conference considered to have been a failure as far as negotiations with
                            a view to ameliorating present tariff conditions are concerned. The
                            general air has been pessimistic throughout. A summary of the relatively
                            meager results of the Conference are as follows: <list>

                                    has been postponed until a later meeting. This may take the form

                                    far as collective negotiations are concerned the Final Act of
                                    the Conference flatly declared that they “could not be entered
                                    upon by all of the signatory states en bloc”. The possibility of
                                    bilateral negotiations was “noted with satisfaction” by the
                                    Conference and the hope expressed that some improvement might
                                    possibly result from this method. This obviously means very
                                    little, unless Germany and other Continental countries, fearful
                                    of Great Britain turning to protection, make some concessions in
                                    the way of tariff reductions in direct negotiations with Great

                                    completely as far as conceded action was concerned, the Final

                                    countries. Of the five countries from whom preference was
                                    requested, France, Italy, and Austria refused to consider a
                                    preferential régime, Czechoslovakia doubtful, and only Germany
                                    willing to negotiate on basis. It is understood that Germany has
                                    already begun preliminary negotiations with Roumania for a
                                    general commercial treaty. It is not improbable that in these
                                    treaty negotiations the question will be raised of granting
                                    possible preferences on cereal products in return for tariff
                                    reductions on industrial products in the exportation of which

                                xml:id="d232fn58">Not printed.</note> if it is considered necessary
                            to retain any of these provisos the treaty obligations could <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0327"/>be saved from impairment by adding to
                            each paragraph in which any such proviso appears a provision that
                            nothing in the paragraph shall be construed or permitted to operate in
                            any manner to impair or affect the provisions of any treaty between the
                            United States and any foreign nation.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that those who favored the reenactment of such provisos
                            had primarily in view their use in connection with our trade with
                            Canada, a country with which we have no treaty guaranteeing
                            most-favored-nation treatment in customs matters. It is estimated that
                            not less than 80 per cent, of our total importations of products which
                            would be affected by the countervailing duty provisos come from that
                            country, and that of the remainder a very considerable proportion comes
                            from other countries with which the United States has no treaties
                            providing for most-favored-nation treatment. Thus it is evident that
                            provisions such as those suggested would not prevent the countervailing
                            duty provisos from serving their intended purpose, and yet would make
                            manifest the intention of this Government fully to meet the obligations
                            accepted in its treaties.</p>

                            <p>The tariff bill as reported to the two houses of Congress by the
                                Conference Committee, on April 28, 1930, still contains five
                                provisos, in Paragraphs 369, 371, 1402, 1650 and 1687, referring,
                                respectively, to automobiles, bicycles, paperboard, coal and

                                most-favored-nation clause of our commercial treaties.</p>
                            <p>The violation of the treaties could be avoided by the insertion in
                                the bill of a section expressly exempting the treaties from the

                                situation is attached. It is suggested that you give consideration
                                to the question of bringing the situation to the attention of the

                            approximately 45.000.000 RM p. a. at present, would completely disappear
                            if the tariff bill in its present form were enacted into law by the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The latest incident in connection with the
                            French protests and criticisms of the new tariff bill is a rather
                            disquieting letter I received yesterday from M. Flandin, the French
                            Minister of Commerce, in direct charge of tariff and customs matters. I
                            am enclosing a copy and translation of his letter, together with a copy
                            of my reply.</p>
                        <p>As M. Flandin indicates, and as I have already advised the Department in
                            previous despatches, he has been very helpful in preventing actual
                            legislative reprisals on the part of the French Parliament. He clearly
                            suggests, however, in the letter enclosed, that if raises, particularly
                            on laces, which furnished such an acute situation here, are contemplated
                            by the Tariff Commission, he will be helpless in his efforts to prevent
                            unfortunate results.</p>
                        <p>I am drawing this specially to the attention of the Department as I feel
                            it is of such importance that some consideration should be given to this
                            matter if a possible tariff war is to be prevented. It is only necessary
                            to go back to the French motor tariff legislation to <pb n="250"
                                xml:id="pg_250" facs="0330"/>realize that if the lace schedule, for
                            instance, should be raised above existing law, it would probably be a
                            signal for retaliation all along the line. I am presenting the situation
                            as it apparently exists on this side and have the honor [etc.]</p>

                                in this morning’s “La Journée Industrielle,” the following news item
                                dated Washington, July 1st: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Senate has voted Mr. Bingham’s resolution ordering the

                                tariff, nor are you unaware that I have encountered great difficulty
                                in having my point of view shared in parliamentary circles: many
                                representatives of agricultural and industrial circles demanded
                                purely and simply that, as regards American imports, the general
                                tariff be substituted for the minimum tariff.</p>
                            <p>If the item quoted above, destroying the happy effect of your recent
                                efforts, should be confirmed, I fear I should not be able any longer
                                to resist the pressure being brought to bear against me.</p>
                            <p>Knowing how much you yourself are endeavoring to reach a conciliatory
                                solution, I wanted, my dear Ambassador, to inform you, in a strictly
                                friendly and private way, of the unfortunate repercussion on French
                                opinion of the decision of the Senate, and beg you to believe in my

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Minister</hi>: I have your letter of
                                July 2nd and hasten to reply thereto. At the outset, permit me again
                                to emphasize the deep appreciation I feel for the generous and
                                helpful cooperation you have given in your desire to alleviate
                                criticism of the new tariff.</p>
                            <p>I am of the opinion that you are unnecessarily disturbed over the <pb
                                    n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0331"/>reported action of the
                                United States Senate directing the Tariff Commission to investigate
                                production costs of laces, cloths, etc. It is now very simple under
                                the new law to obtain a cost of production investigation by the
                                United States Tariff Commission, and it can be obtained by a request
                                of the President, either House of Congress, or any interested party.
                                As you, of course, understand, the Tariff Commission is charged with
                                the responsibility of investigating production costs either for the
                                purpose of raising or lowering duty to a maximum of 50% over or
                                under existing rates. Therefore, it is impossible to prevent
                                interested parties from asking the Commission to investigate tariffs
                                that may be considered too low any more than to investigate tariffs
                                that may be considered too high. The result of the Tariff
                                Commission’s inquiry must be based upon the actual facts,
                                irrespective of the wishes of the applicant.</p>
                            <p>The mere fact that Senator Bingham requested the Tariff Commission to
                                make this investigation is evidence that the rates as passed were
                                lower than some members of the Senate desired, thus demonstrating
                                that real consideration has been given to the French protests
                                against higher tariffs.</p>
                            <p>I had an informal conference yesterday with Ambassador Claudel at
                                which time I renewed my assurances given you and others that I would
                                gladly refer to the State Department requests for review by the
                                Tariff Commission of the new rates on any commodities in which
                                French exporters were particularly interested and where they
                                believed the rates unjust. Of course, I must repeat that the result
                                of such inquiries, whether the rates should be lowered, increased,
                                or remain as specified, is entirely a matter which must be
                                controlled by the facts adduced.</p>
                            <p>Both France and the United States have adopted a policy of
                                protection. The tariff is supposed to represent a fair estimate of
                                the difference between the cost of production in competing
                                countries. If the Tariff Commission finds the duty is greater than
                                the difference in cost, it naturally recommends a reduction in
                                tariff. If, on the other hand, it finds the tariff insufficient to
                                represent the difference in cost, it just as naturally recommends an
                                increase. I am afraid speculation as to the final recommendation of
                                the Tariff Commission would be resultless but I repeat that, based
                                on the well known formula and policy of protection, the reorganized
                                Tariff Commission is given increased authority over the old law to
                                reach decisions fair and equable to both countries.</p>
                            <p>With further assurances of my desire to cooperate in every possible
                                consistent manner, I beg to remain,</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            of the 70th Congress, and almost identical with S–3574 which failed to
                            pass the House of Representatives in 1927. This bill appears to be open
                            to serious objection on the part of foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the bill provides for interference with the
                            composition of the crews of foreign vessels while in United States
                            ports. It is the general international understanding that when private
                            ships of a foreign state are in port the territorial authorities should
                            refrain from interference with the interior economy of the vessel. The
                            composition of the crew is a matter which affects the interior economy
                            of a vessel, and the proposed clauses if enacted, would therefore
                            conflict with a well-established, well-recognized and useful
                            international practice.</p>
                        <p>Further, the bill would in effect discriminate against foreign vessels
                            trading in American ports. It would cause great embarrassment to all
                            ships in which Chinese labor and Lascars are employed, and in particular
                            to British Tramp Steamers trading with American ports in the course of
                            their world voyages. The technical difficulties of eliminating from the
                            crews of tramp steamers the Asiatic elements against which this bill is
                            aimed would, in practice, probably result in the masters of such vessels
                            being compelled to cut out American ports from their sailing schedules.
                            In this way freight rates on American exported produce would
                            automatically rise, prices of American grain and cotton and other
                            produce would be increased in the countries of consumption and British
                            consumers of such produce would be obliged to curtail their purchases
                            with resulting damage to themselves and their trade with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Even stronger objection may be taken to the proposed legislation on the
                            ground that it constitutes a direct interference with trade, its effect
                            being to dictate to other countries how they are to carry goods to and
                            from the American market. At the same time, the proposed interference
                            with the composition of the crews of foreign vessels and <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0333"/>in particular the difficulty of
                            complying with section 6 of the Bill which refuses clearance to vessels
                            departing from the United States unless carrying a crew of at least the
                            same number as on arrival, are likely to lead to much inconvenience, and
                            in many cases to long delays involving the alteration of sailing
                            schedules and serious loss to business. Further, the bill would prohibit
                            the employment of Lascars and Chinese on ships registered outside their
                            own States, and countries such as India might well consider this as a
                            direct and unwarrantable interference with the employment of their
                            subjects on the high seas. Active apprehensions have in fact been caused
                            in the Legislative Assembly in India by the legislation proposed, and
                            they have been in communication with His Majesty’s Government in Great
                            Britain on the subject.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, protests have been received from many of the principal
                            shipping interests in Great Britain. The opinion was expressed before
                            the House Committee in 1927 that the bill would in practice constitute a
                            discrimination in favor of Japanese and other Asiatic vessels at the
                            expense of the merchant marine of Great Britain and all other maritime
                            countries, since whereas vessels of these countries would be prevented
                            from employing Japanese and Asiatic labour, Japanese or other Asiatic
                            merchant vessels would be free to call at United States ports with crews
                            of their own nationality on board. At the same time, as pointed out
                            above, there would appear to be discrimination against Asiatic seamen
                            serving in European or other vessels not of their own country.</p>
                        <p>Detailed objections to the bill on technical grounds were laid before the
                            House Committee on Immigration by representatives of the shipping
                            interests in previous years.</p>

                        <p>Senate Bill S. 1941 and House Bill H. B. 7763, which are identical
                            measures “to provide for the deportation of certain alien seamen, and
                            for other purposes”, are re-introductions of legislative proposals which
                            failed to pass the 69th and 70th Congresses. The possibility of the
                            enactment of these Bills is causing concern to foreign countries, both
                            because they diverge in certain important respects from accepted
                            international practice, and because their provisions would create
                            serious difficulties for foreign shipping.</p>
                        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0334"/>
                        <p>The general ground on which objection may be based is that the proposals
                            would result in drastic interference with the composition of crews of
                            foreign vessels in United States ports; they would thus infringe on the
                            accepted principle which provides against interference with the domestic
                            economy of a foreign vessel, except in extraordinary circumstances, by
                            the authorities of the States which it visits in the ordinary course of
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Bills would have the effect of discriminating against
                            foreign vessels trading to the United States, and this discrimination
                            would be particularly severe in the case of vessels the crews of which
                            were in part composed of Oriental seamen. These vessels, unless they
                            were registered in the country of the nationality of their crews,
                            probably would be debarred from entering a port of the United States by
                            the effect of Section 7 of the Bills.</p>
                        <p>Specific objections may be made to the provision of Section 2 which
                            authorizes a United States Immigration Inspector to determine whether
                            any member of a vessel’s crew is or is not a bona fide seaman; also to
                            the provision of Section 3 that an alien who has been found to be not a
                            bona fide seaman by the Immigration Service, and who is not admissible
                            as an immigrant, must be deported as a passenger on a vessel other than
                            that by which he arrived; and to the provision of Section 6 that every
                            vessel, the majority of the crew of which has been engaged abroad,
                            should not be granted clearance unless it takes out from the United
                            States a crew at least equal in number of that with which it
                            entered.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted also that the Bills apparently would apply to shipping on
                            the Great Lakes as well as to shipping at ocean ports.</p>
                        <p>Several of their provisions, and those of Section 6 especially, might
                            easily cause substantial delay, trouble and expense to Canadian lines
                            maintaining regular passenger and freight services on the Great
                            Lakes.</p>
                        <p>Representations have been received from shipping interests in Canada
                            complaining of the hardship which would be inflicted on them by the
                            passage of the Bill for the reasons which are briefly summarized above,
                            and on additional technical grounds.</p>

                            Safety of Life at Sea met in London in 1913, it was expected that it
                            would be followed and completed by an international conference on the
                            subject of loadline, and a committee was appointed by the President of
                            the British Board of Trade in 1913 to review the whole subject of
                            loadline and prepare a report which would serve as a basis for
                            international discussion and agreement. The intention was that the
                            Safety of Life at Sea Conference should deal with the safety of the
                            passenger ship, with the provision of wireless and with the rules of
                            general navigation, <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0336"/>and that a
                            conference on loadline should cover the question of the seaworthiness of

                            for international discussion.</p>
                        <p>This Government considers that an international meeting to discuss load
                            line legislation will be desirable and believes that the proper course
                            will be to have the British Committee’s report form the basis of an
                            international discussion.</p>
                        <p>If an invitation to such a conference is contemplated, this Government
                            will be pleased to be notified at the earliest possible moment,
                            preferably by cable, in order that the authority to attend the
                            conference, and later an appropriation to pay the expenses of a
                            delegation thereto may be requested of the Congress.</p>

                            past two years of a committee of nine technical advisers and
                            representatives of the shipping interests of the country and contains
                            concrete proposals which the Department of Commerce believes have the
                            approval of all the American interests concerned. At the specific
                            request of the Secretary of Commerce, you are instructed that this
                            report with its enclosures is to form the basis of the American
                            proposals at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>For your further guidance, there are quoted the following paragraphs from
                            a memorandum submitted by the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of
                            State: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The fixing of load lines on merchant vessels in the foreign
                                    trade is essentially international in its character and
                                    uniformity in the rules governing the placing of such load lines
                                    is essential to the proper administration of the law by the
                                    several nations involved.</p>
                                <p>“It is important that United States practices, particularly those
                                    pertaining to tankers and to lumber-carrying vessels, be
                                    properly presented to the Conference as otherwise, the
                                    regulations adopted to which our vessels would be subject while
                                    in foreign ports, might seriously handicap American vessels and
                                    trade, and the initiative and <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259"
                                        facs="0339"/>ability of our shipbuilders and ship operators
                                    would be adversely affected in such trade.</p>
                                <p>“To obtain acceptance of the American proposals will require
                                    determined effort and absolute unanimity on the part of the
                                    American delegation. It is imperative that the American
                                    delegation present a united front if the desired results are to
                                    be obtained. The individuals composing the delegation must be
                                    guided and abide by the decisions of the delegation as a whole,
                                    and individual opinions in opposition to the delegation’s
                                    decisions must be restrained if the influence of the American
                                    delegation is not to suffer seriously. To assure that the
                                    American proposals are couched in well-chosen words which give
                                    exactly the intent desired, it would appear that, except in
                                    informal committee discussion, they should be prepared in
                                    advance. Important questions of policy and general principle
                                    should be determined by vote of the delegation. These should
                                    follow as far as possible the recommendations agreed to in the
                                    preparatory work.</p>
                                <p>“It should be borne in mind at all times that the delegation has
                                    a three-fold responsibility; first, to uphold the prestige and
                                    dignity of the United States; second, to obtain the highest
                                    practicable standard of safety at sea for American citizens
                                    traveling in ships flying its flag and those of other nations;
                                    and third, to obtain an agreement to facilitate trade between
                                    the United States and foreign countries, bearing in mind at all
                                    times that no load line shall be established or marked on any
                                    vessel which load line is above the actual line of safety.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It would seem to be desirable that English as well as French should be
                            the official language of the International Conference on Load Lines, not
                            only as a compliment to the British Government, in whose territory the
                            Conference is to be held, but also because of the richness of the
                            English language in commercial and nautical terminology. For the same
                            reasons it is believed that any Convention or other instrument signed at
                            the Conference should be signed in English as well as in French. As,
                            however, the Conference will be held at London, it would seem to be more
                            appropriate for the British delegates to make proposals in regard to
                            this matter. You may confer with them informally concerning it, and
                            should they propose to the Conference the adoption of English as an
                            official language of the Conference, you will give the proposal your
                            support. This will conform to the procedure recently adopted at the
                            Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea.</p>
                        <p>You will be assisted in your work at the Conference by the following
                            technical advisers: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>You are instructed to inform the American Embassy at London of your
                            arrival and to maintain contact with the Embassy during the progress of
                            negotiations. A copy of your instructions is being <pb n="260"
                                xml:id="pg_260" facs="0340"/>forwarded to the Embassy, which is
                            being requested to afford the delegation appropriate assistance. It is
                            particularly desired that should questions of a political, rather than a
                            technical, nature arise you will consult the Embassy and be guided by
                            its suggestions in this connection.</p>

                            down in this Convention, and should whenever possible be made after

                        <p>The British Embassy have for some time past corresponded semiofficially
                            with the Department of State in regard to the draft Convention on Oil
                            Pollution prepared as a result of the conference held at Washington in
                            the summer of 1926.</p>
                        <p>A member of the Embassy staff who discussed the present position
                            respecting this Convention with an official of the Department in May
                            last, understood that the German and Japanese Governments <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0356"/>still maintained certain objections to
                            the draft and that the Italian Government were not altogether satisfied
                            with it. Moreover, there appeared to be no strong demand in the United
                            States for bringing the Convention into force, and in these
                            circumstances the Department of State were disposed to let the matter
                            rest unless His Majesty’s Government or one of the other interested
                            Powers moved the United States Government to take some further
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy have now learned that His Majesty’s Government in the United
                            Kingdom attach importance to the conclusion of the proposed Convention
                            since this alone would enable the problem of oil pollution to be dealt
                            with by international agreement. It will be remembered that at the
                            Washington Conference in 1926 two measures were proposed, viz, the
                            carrying of oil separators on all ships, or the fixing of zones round
                            the coasts within which the discharge of oil or oily water should be
                            prohibited. Neither of these measures would necessarily be a complete
                            cure because it would, from the nature of the case, be impossible to be
                            certain that the separators on board the ships would be used as they
                            should be used on all occasions, and it would equally be impossible to
                            secure evidence of the improper discharge of oil within prohibited
                            zones. They were, however, the only measures which Governments, as such,
                            could take to deal with this nuisance, and it was clear that
                            international agreement could not be obtained for the first of these
                            remedies, the carrying of separators.</p>
                        <p>The second remedy, the establishment of zones, is the one embodied in the
                            draft Convention, and His Majesty’s Government consider it very
                            desirable that every effort should be made to secure the adoption of
                            that Convention. It is true that the shipowners in the United Kingdom,
                            and it is believed, also in the United States and in Holland, have
                            voluntarily adopted the principle of the Convention, and it cannot be
                            said that the adoption of the Convention by the remaining Powers would
                            necessarily put an end to the nuisance in any of the countries where it
                            still exists; but it is the only international method of dealing with
                            this nuisance which at present has any chance of success at all, and if
                            the negotiations for the Convention are dropped or fail, there will be
                            renewed pressure for the adoption of national measures by individual
                            Governments. This, His Majesty’s Government consider, would be
                            undesirable in the interests of all concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy have therefore been instructed to enquire whether the United
                            States Government, if officially approached, would be disposed to exert
                            their good offices on behalf of the draft Convention with the other
                            Governments interested.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Torr<note n="85" xml:id="d251fn85">C. J. W. Torr, Second Secretary of
                                the British Embassy.</note> called by appointment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that he wished informally to explore the ground with
                            regard to the British Government’s attitude in reference to questions
                            raised in the British Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of
                            August 22, 1929, referred to in the Ambassador’s letter to the Secretary
                            of May 23, 1930. The communications in question conveyed inquiry whether
                            the American Government, if officially approached, would be disposed to
                            exert its “good offices on behalf of the draft Convention with the other
                            Governments interested”. He would like to know how great importance the
                            British Government attached to this matter at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Torr said that he must base his opinion on the views expressed in the
                                <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of August 22, 1929. There the
                            British Government stated that it considered it very desirable that
                            every effort be made to secure the adoption of the Convention “since
                            that alone would enable the problem of oil pollution to be dealt with by
                            international agreement”. Mr. Torr said that he did not know what was
                            the situation in British territorial and adjacent waters, whether it had
                            improved or whether it was worse than in 1926 and before, but that he
                            knew that the Board of Trade frequently brought up the question of the
                            desirability of having an international agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that the situation in American coastal waters, in
                            relation to oil pollution, appears to have improved materially in recent
                            years and that there is not the amount of complaint that there formerly
                            was and not the amount of agitation in reference to legislation and/or
                            international agreement. He explained that certain parties particularly
                            interested in both questions have apparently concentrated on the
                            question of domestic legislation and have advanced the view that it
                            would be well for the United States first to get the matter regulated in
                            reference to its own waters by domestic legislation and then, thereby
                            being in better position to enter or take the lead in international
                            action, to revert to discussion of an international agreement.
                            Therefore, it was the thought of the Department that it might be best to
                            let the matter of the draft agreement continue to lie on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Torr inquired whether we knew anything about the views of Canada. Mr.
                            Hornbeck replied that we did not. After some discussion, <pb n="279"
                                xml:id="pg_279" facs="0359"/>Mr. Torr said that he thought he might
                            endeavor informally to see whether the views of Canada could be
                            ascertained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Torr said again that he thought his Government attached quite a
                            little importance to the matter and asked what countries were standing
                            out or indifferent. Mention was made of Japan, Italy and Germany. Mr.
                            Torr advanced, tentatively, the view that the subject might be one which
                            might be taken up by the League of Nations as a question susceptible of
                            practical solution by and among the countries of Europe, inasmuch as the
                            United States and Japan are remote from European waters. But, he said,
                            that did not dispose of the question of acts in the neighborhood of
                            European waters by vessels of countries not party to such agreement as
                            might be concluded. There followed some discussion of the possibility
                            that the United States and Japan would find it convenient to become
                            parties to an agreement first concluded by and among European
                            states.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that we had also had inquiries from the Danish
                            Legation, and that we would like to get such information as could be had
                            with regard to the view of the Danish Government. Mr. Torr suggested
                            that inquiry might be made with regard to the view of the Japanese
                            Government. Mr. Hornbeck said that he would endeavor to discuss the
                            matter informally with an officer of the Danish Legation and an officer
                            of the Japanese Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to the question of extraterritoriality (see
                            separate memorandum of even date).<note n="86" xml:id="d251fn86">Not

                            on June 27 and to call at your Legation soon after their arrival. Please
                            deliver their instruction to them as soon as you conveniently can. A
                            copy of it is attached hereto for your information and the files of your
                            Legation.</p>
                        <p>There is also enclosed a copy of a proposed budget of the expenditures

                            approved by the chairman of the committee, consistent with such budget,
                            and to draw on the Secretary of State for the required amounts, citing
                            on the drafts the appropriation chargeable and rendering a separate

                        <p>You are requested to render to these gentlemen such other assistance in

                        <p>In this connection your attention is especially called to the fifth,
                            sixth and seventh paragraphs of their instruction, from which you will
                            note that the Government to which you are accredited is not one of those
                            which have hitherto requested this Government’s cooperation in the
                            reconnaissance surveys and that they are, therefore, asked to refrain
                            from offering their services to that Government until they shall be
                            informed that this Government’s cooperation has been requested. You are
                            instructed to bring this matter as soon as possible to the attention of
                            the appropriate officials of the Government to which you are accredited,
                            assuring them that your Government is, however, both willing and ready
                            to make available its cooperation with their Government in these surveys
                            as soon as information shall reach the Secretary of State through the
                            Director General of the Pan American Union that such cooperation is
                            desired. You, also, will be promptly informed thereafter and will be
                            authorized to present the Engineers to the appropriate authorities of
                            the Panamánian Government so that they may properly offer their services
                            to it. If that Government’s failure to request this Government’s
                            cooperation should have been due merely to inadvertence and should it be
                            the desire of that Government that the cooperation should begin in the
                            near future, the necessary preliminary correspondence can of course be
                            attended to in a very few days by cable or by air mail.</p>

                                agencies of this Government to cooperate with the other interested
                                states in the preparation of such projects. In his annual message to
                                Congress on December 4, 1928, the President of the United States
                                said: “In my message last year I expressed the view that we should
                                lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal
                                points on this hemisphere south of the Rio Grande. My view has not
                                    changed.”<note n="94" xml:id="d252fn8"><ref

                                from the Second Pan American Highway Congress, which had been held
                                at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 16 to August 28, 1929,
                                attended a conference at Panamá from October 7 to 12 with

                                work, the Pan American Union should appoint an Inter-American

                                the project; and all Governments interested were requested to

                                above, appropriating funds to meet the expense of its participation
                                in the projected reconnaissance surveys, is one of the important
                                steps recently taken by this Government in the requested
                                cooperation. Another is your designation as the agency through which
                                the Secretary of State is to make effective this Government’s
                                cooperation in these surveys. In this connection it is appropriate
                                to allude to the fact that, on May 27, 1930, the President affixed
                                his approval to the Act passed by the Congress of the United States
                                (No. 269, 71st Congress)<note n="97" xml:id="d252fn11">46 Stat

                                Highway Conference at Panamá last October, as will be seen by
                                referring to the enclosed copy of the text of the Resolutions of
                                that conference. A copy of the legislation just referred to is also
                                    enclosed.<note n="96" xml:id="d252fn12">Not printed.</note></p>
                            <p>The Director General of the Pan American Union has informed the
                                Department of State that the Governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua
                                have expressed a desire to have reconnaissance surveys undertaken to
                                determine the most desirable route for the proposed inter-American
                                highway across their respective territories. The chiefs of the
                                diplomatic missions of this Government in those countries had
                                previously informed the Department that they had been apprised of
                                the fact that those Governments had taken the steps mentioned. The
                                steps taken by these two Governments appear to have complied fully
                                with the conditions which the Act appropriating the $50,000 and also
                                the Act approved March 4, 1929, authorizing such an appropriation
                                make a necessary prerequisite to the Secretary of State’s
                                cooperating with the other interested Governments in these
                                reconnaissance surveys. Referring to the resolution adopted by the
                                Inter-American Highway Conference at Panamá recommending the
                                creation of an Inter-American Highway <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284"
                                    facs="0364"/>Commission, the Director General also stated that,
                                in accordance with the terms of that resolution, the Governments of
                                Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panamá had designated their
                                representatives on that Commission. The actions just mentioned
                                appear to indicate that these four Governments also expect to
                                cooperate in the construction of the inter-American highway; but the
                                Director General has not yet informed the Department that any
                                Governments other than Guatemala and Nicaragua have actually
                                requested this Government’s cooperation in the reconnaissance
                                surveys.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the Act approved March 29, 1930, quoted in
                                the second paragraph above, which makes available the appropriation
                                for the reconnaissance surveys, and also the Joint Resolution
                                approved on March 4, 1929, authorizing such an appropriation both
                                clearly contemplate that the cooperation of the Secretary of State
                                in the reconnaissance surveys shall be made available only when the
                                other interested Governments shall have “initiated a request or
                                signified a desire to the Pan American Union” for such cooperation,
                                and since this Government has of course no desire to participate in
                                the contemplated reconnaissance surveys in any country whose
                                Government has not unmistakably indicated a desire to have this
                                Government’s participation, you are instructed to offer your
                                services, for the present at least, only to the two Governments
                                mentioned above as having complied fully with the conditions made by
                                law a necessary prerequisite to the Secretary of State’s making
                                available this Government’s cooperation. As soon as the Director
                                General shall have informed the Secretary of State that the other
                                interested Governments, or any of them, have requested this
                                Government’s cooperation, you will be promptly informed and will be
                                instructed to offer your services also to them. The chief of this
                                Government’s diplomatic mission in each of the countries concerned
                                whose Governments have not hitherto requested this Government’s
                                cooperation is being instructed to embrace an early opportunity to
                                bring this matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities of
                                the Government to which he is accredited, assuring them that his
                                Government is both willing and ready to make available its
                                cooperation with their Government in these surveys as soon as
                                information shall reach the Secretary of State through the Director
                                General of the Pan American Union that such cooperation is desired.
                                To the Minister at Panamá it is being suggested that if that
                                Government’s failure to request this Government’s cooperation should
                                have been due merely to inadvertence and should it be the desire of
                                that Government that the cooperation should begin in the near future
                                the necessary preliminary correspondence can of course be attended
                                to in a very few days by cable or by air mail.</p>

                            <p>Before offering your services to any interested Government, or any
                                official thereof, you are instructed to call upon the chief of the
                                diplomatic mission of the United States at the capital of the
                                country concerned in order that you may be properly introduced to
                                the appropriate officials of that Government. The chief of each such
                                diplomatic mission is being apprised of the fact that you have been
                                designated and instructed to make effective this Government’s
                                cooperation with the Government to which he is accredited, in case,
                                or as soon as, such cooperation shall have been requested. He is
                                also being informed that you will call upon him before establishing
                                any official relations with the Government to which he is
                                accredited; and he is being instructed to introduce you to the
                                proper authorities and to render to you such other assistance as may
                                be possible and proper.</p>
                            <p>You are instructed to submit written reports to the Secretary of
                                State from time to time, through the diplomatic mission of the
                                United States at the capital of the country where you may be at the
                                time each report is made, regarding your progress in the performance
                                of the task which has been entrusted to you. These progress reports
                                should be submitted not less frequently than once every three
                                months; and they may be made as much more frequently as you may deem
                                it desirable to make them. If, as it is understood you contemplate
                                doing, you establish and maintain an office for your headquarters at
                                or near the city of Panamá, the Legation of the United States at
                                that capital will of course be the medium through which you will
                                communicate with the Secretary of State, not only while cooperating
                                with the Government of that country, should you be informed that it
                                has requested your cooperation, but also while establishing your
                                headquarters, if they are to be in that country or the Canal Zone,
                                and, also, should there be such a time, whenever you shall not
                                actually be engaged in cooperation with the Government of any other
                                country.</p>

                            telegram No. 46 of July 11, 11 a.m., which you will of course have
                            already received, you have been informed that the Department perceives
                            no objection to the Commission’s acceptance of the office quarters
                            offered by the Panamanian Government. In that instruction it was
                            suggested that should an appropriate occasion offer you might express
                            through the proper officials your Government’s appreciation of their
                            Government’s offer.</p>

                                xml:id="d254fn2">Not printed.</note> mentioned in the second
                            paragraph of the Department’s instruction to you of July 1, no copy of
                            which, your telegram under acknowledgment states, accompanied that
                            instruction. The second copy of the budget is for delivery by you to the
                            engineers since, from the copy of their instruction enclosed with the
                            instruction of July 1 to you, you will observe a copy of that budget
                            should have gone also to them. Possibly their copy also failed to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>The Department would like to have you ascertain whether the instruction
                            to the engineers bore a date and, if not, wishes you to affix to it the
                            date July 1, 1930. The reason for making this request is that the
                            Department’s file copy of the instruction to the engineers has been
                            found to be undated. It should of course bear the same date as the
                            instruction to you with which it was sent for delivery by you.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the Panamanian Government’s request for this Government’s
                            cooperation, to which the third numbered paragraph of your telegram of
                            July 11 relates, shall have reached the Department from the Director
                            General of the Pan American Union you will be requested by telegraph
                            officially to present the engineers to the appropriate Panamanian
                            authorities so that they may properly offer to cooperate with the
                            Panamanian Government in the reconnaissance surveys.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s mailed instruction No. 33 of July 12, 1930,
                            and the Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 49, dated July 16, 6
                            P.M.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with instructions, I have introduced the members of the
                            Technical Commission on the Inter-American Highway Reconnaissance
                            Surveys to the appropriate Panamanian authorities. In presenting the
                            members of the Commission I stated that the Technical Commission is now
                            prepared to offer its cooperation to the Panamanian Government in making
                            the survey of the Panamanian section of the proposed Inter-American
                            Highways. At the same time, I expressed appreciation orally on behalf of
                            my Government for the Panamanian Government’s kind offer of office
                            quarters to the Technical Commission and accepted the offer.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the second paragraph of the Department’s instruction
                            No. 33 of July 12, 1930, the two copies of the budget mentioned therein
                            have been received and one copy has been delivered to the Chairman of
                            the Technical Commission. In this connection may I state that it is my
                            understanding that I am to draw only that part of their salary accounts
                            which comes under the special appropriation, and that it is my
                            understanding that salary accounts paid from bureau funds will be paid
                            directly to the members of the Technical Commission from their office in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I have investigated the question raised in paragraph three of the
                            Department’s instruction No. 33 dated July 12, 1930, and find that the
                            copy of instructions addressed to the Technical Commission is dated July
                            1. The carbon copy thereof which I have kept for my files was, however,
                            dated July 2, 1930. I have changed this date to read July 1, in
                            accordance with instructions.</p>

                            here as soon as, or whenever, the engineers referred to in the

                            proceed to Nicaragua. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at the same time
                            requested that the Legation express to the Government of the United

                                particularly interested in the country adjoining the Panama and
                                Nicaragua borders insofar that we would be unable to complete our
                                work in northern Panama until we had made a survey of the frontier
                                region of Costa Rica in order that the proposed Inter-American
                                highway in the two countries would join at a common point on the
                                border.</p>
                            <p>The selection of the junction point at the border between Costa Rica
                                and Panama will necessitate a study of the terrain in both countries
                                adjacent to the border in order to select a feasible route of equal
                                advantage to both Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>Since the Costa Rican Minister had been one of the delegates from
                                Costa Rica to the conference held here in Panama in the fall of
                                1929, I was sure that he was familiar with the procedure necessary
                                to arrange for the services of the Technical Committee in Costa
                                Rica. I stated to the Costa Rican Minister that it would be a
                                pleasure to cooperate with the authorities of Costa Rica in a
                                reconnaissance survey within their borders, and that I assumed that
                                he was fully informed as to the proper procedure before our
                                cooperation could be given, namely that his Government through the
                                Pan-American Union in Washington, would make a request or signify a
                                desire to have the cooperation of the Technical Committee to the
                                United States State Department. The State Department would after
                                receiving such request, promptly notify the Technical Committee, who
                                would then immediately make plans to offer their services to Costa
                                Rica.</p>
                            <p>I told the Costa Rican Minister that during rainy season we had been
                                forced to abandon our reconnaissance in northern Panama and were
                                working at present in Honduras. However within a month or six weeks
                                we expected to return to northern Panama to complete the
                                reconnaissance there, and it would be of particular advantage to us
                                if we were able to reconnoitre the country in Costa Rica adjacent to
                                the Panamanian border in order that we might select a proper
                                junction point on the border.</p>

                            of the United States Technical Committee on the Inter-American Highway

                            in those surveys.</p>
                        <p>Your attention is especially invited to the next to the last paragraph of

                            of the Government to which you are accredited and to submit an early

                            obtain in addition to that contained in your Legation’s two despatches
                            cited in the instruction to the engineers. You will note the importance
                            of their being informed at least regarding the points where the
                            Salvadoran section of the Inter-American Highway reaches the frontiers
                            of Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the last paragraph of the instruction to the engineers you
                            are authorized in your discretion to inform the appropriate Salvadoran
                            authorities that your Government’s cooperating engineers would
                            appreciate an invitation to inspect the Salvadoran section of this
                            Highway even though it has already been located and partially, or
                            completely, constructed especially the portions of it near the frontiers
                            of the two neighboring countries in order that the engineers may be
                            better prepared to cooperate with the Governments of Guatemala and
                            Honduras in planning the connecting portions of the Highway in those
                            countries.</p>

                            undertake a study of the subject and to formulate a project that might
                            be transmitted by the Governing Board to the Highway Congress at Rio de
                            Janeiro. The Confederation for Highway Education was organized in 1924
                            by a group of highway engineers of Latin America who were invited to
                            visit the United States as guests of the Highway Education Board and
                            undertake a study of highway construction, administration and finance as

                            of the tour, conferences were held at the Pan American Union, at which
                            the Highway Confederation was created, with National Federations in each
                            country and with the headquarters of the Executive Committee established
                            at the Pan American Union. As the purpose of the Confederation is to
                            promote by every possible means all phases of highway activity, the
                            Executive Committee of the Confederation immediately accepted the
                            invitation of the Governing Board.</p>
                        <p>The Executive Committee of the Confederation made a thorough study of the
                            existing conventions on the regulation of automotive traffic, including
                            the Paris Conventions of 1909 and 1926, and also availed itself of the
                            studies made by the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety
                            appointed by President Hoover while Secretary of Commerce. The results
                            of these studies were incorporated into a draft convention submitted to
                            the Pan American Union, and in turn transmitted to the Second Pan
                            American Highway Congress at Rio de Janeiro. At that Congress the draft
                            convention was approved with virtually no modifications, but as the
                            delegates did not possess the necessary powers to sign a convention, the
                            Congress limited itself to the adoption of a resolution approving the
                            draft and forwarding it to the Pan American Union.</p>

                            traffic recommended that the Director General be authorized to transmit

                            unanimously approved by the Board, and communications were dispatched to

                                <p>“Gentlemen of the Conference:</p>
                                <p>I deem it a very real privilege to extend to you the warmest
                                    possible welcome on behalf of the Pan American Union. You are
                                    assembled to fulfill a most important mission. In giving final
                                    and definite form to the great work accomplished by the Second
                                    Pan American Highway Congress which met at Rio de Janeiro in
                                    August, 1929, you are laying the foundation for important steps
                                    in the development of closer communication between the nations
                                    of the American Continent. The Convention on the Regulation of
                                    Automotive Traffic which is to be submitted to you is destined
                                    to be one of the most important influences in giving the fullest
                                    measure of efficiency to that great factor in inter-American
                                    communication, namely, the motor highway. The successful
                                    operation of a Pan American Highway, which is no longer in the
                                    realm of speculation, but has come within the confines of
                                    reality, requires uniform standards of regulation, which the
                                    proposed convention is intended to supply.</p>
                                <p>Permit me to congratulate you on the services which you are
                                    rendering to the entire Continent in considering this important
                                    matter, and at the same time to wish you the fullest measure of

                                    bringing the peoples of those countries into closer relations
                                    and understanding through the medium of modern motor
                                    transportation. The countries whose representatives have signed
                                    the Convention have said to each other, in effect, ‘The gate at
                                    the frontier is open; the latch-string is out.’</p>
                                <p>“During the past few years, the efforts of leading men of the
                                    various Pan American countries have been devoted to the
                                    stimulation of highway building, which will offer to all the
                                    advantages in social and economic ways that grow out of the
                                    opening of modern highways and the flow of modern motor traffic.
                                    Through long and patient effort upon the part of these men,
                                    devoted to these highways of friendship, this Convention has
                                    been evolved, which represents a large measure of progress
                                    toward the ultimate development of widespread modern highway
                                    transportation facilities connecting the Pan American States,
                                    and it is a vital prerequisite to that end, because adequate
                                    highway transportation cannot be developed unless it is free
                                    from the influence of widely divergent regulations affecting the
                                    use of vehicles upon the highways connecting the various
                                    countries. There are countless matters of an intricate,
                                    technical, and practical nature that bear upon the operation of
                                    vehicles and the use of highways in a safe and effective manner,
                                    and it is no easy task to bring the minds of nineteen countries
                                    to agree upon uniformity. To accomplish that end, a large degree
                                    of concession and compromise is required. Probably no convention
                                    would ever have been agreed upon which would embody all the
                                    proposals that might have been put forward for the regulation
                                    and safeguarding of motor transportation and highway use. But in
                                    a fine spirit of consideration for the views of each other, the
                                    representatives of the signatory states have come to an accord
                                    upon the minimum and essential requirements and have thereby
                                    made possible this Convention. This Convention, therefore,
                                    represents a tremendous gain for those countries, not only in
                                    the economic and social advantages toward which its operation
                                    will assist, but in a larger sense, it is a demonstration of
                                    enduring valuable friendships between the Pan American countries
                                    and peoples and of their willingness and eagerness to meet upon
                                    the common ground of practical affairs in the interests of
                                    closer acquaintance and understanding. The Convention is indeed
                                    a tangible and practical affair that reduces to concrete terms
                                    the real intent of the Pan American countries to cooperate for
                                    the mutual benefit of their peoples in making modern highways
                                    and motor transportation available to all of them.</p>

                            and with a profound appreciation of the significance of the subject
                            under discussion. The subject of highway construction has only within
                            recent years received serious attention in any of the Republics of Latin
                            America, but in that time rapid progress has been made in all the
                            countries, and today every nation of the American Continent has a
                            constructive program of highway expansion.</p>

                        <p>In the highway programs of the several countries one of the items of
                            major importance is that of a road or system of roads that will connect
                            all the Republics of the American Continent, and extend from the United
                            States on the north to Argentina and Chile on the south—in other words,
                            Inter-American Highways. Since the Fifth International Conference of

                            international conferences. As already stated, a commission of Pan
                            American highway engineers visited the United States in 1924 as guests
                            of the Highway Education Board, to study highway construction,
                            administration and finance as practiced in the United States. The
                            outcome of this visit was the creation of the Pan American Confederation
                            for Highway Education, which has ever since been an instrumental factor
                            in promoting road construction on the American Continent. Two Pan

                            Republics of Central America and the United States. At that time an
                            Inter-American Highway Commission was created, to be composed of members
                            appointed by the several Governments. Prior to that time, and as a
                            demonstration of the interest of the Government of the United States in
                            the construction of an Inter-American Highway, the cooperation of
                            engineers of the Bureau of Public Roads of the Department of Agriculture
                            had been offered to any Latin American Republic which might request such
                            cooperation through the Pan American Union. Subsequently an
                            appropriation of $50,000 was made available by the Congress of the
                            United States to provide for such cooperation. Pursuant to requests from
                            a number of the Central American countries for assistance in locating
                            the route of the Inter-American Highway through their respective
                            countries, engineers of the Bureau of Public Roads have been sent to
                            Panama for the purpose of establishing an office and making the
                            necessary preparations to undertake reconnaissance surveys to determine
                            the most feasible route of the Inter-American Highway.<note n="25"

                            Panama to discuss questions connected with the reconnaissance

                            been formally signed. The purpose of this informal gathering was

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the negotiations
                                being carried on in Montevideo between the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                Ministers and the Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding
                                the manner of exchanging Forts Vanguardia and Boquerón, I have the
                                honor to report the following information.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister, Señor Diez de Medina, in a conversation on
                                December 9th, informed me that his Government considered that the
                                terms of the agreement should be carried out in the order in which
                                these terms were set forth, namely, reestablishment of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> in the Chaco before the
                                renewal of diplomatic relations; and restoration of the buildings of
                                Fort Vanguardia by Paraguay before the abandonment of Fort Boquerón
                                by Bolivia. In this connection he declared that the Paraguayan
                                Government held that one of the two designated Uruguayan officers
                                should proceed to Fort Vanguardia and the other to Fort Boquerón,
                                and that Bolivia should abandon the latter Fort upon the
                                commencement of the work of restoration of the buildings of Fort
                                Vanguardia by Paraguay. The Bolivian Government, on the contrary,
                                believed that Fort Vanguardia <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                    facs="0390"/>should first be restored and the two forts then
                                exchanged simultaneously.</p>
                            <p>After an unsuccessful three-hour meeting held at the Foreign Office
                                here on the 9th instant by the Uruguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs and the Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers, the following
                                self-explanatory statement (which I telegraphed to the

                                    <p>(Translation) “In view of the position taken by the
                                        representatives of the contending parties, I thought it
                                        advisable to present in the name of the Uruguayan Government
                                        a formula of conciliation, which was submitted to the
                                        Paraguayan and Bolivian Governments for study. Certain
                                        objections were made by the latter, and many of the
                                        conclusions were rejected by the former.</p>
                                    <p>“Tomorrow the Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs will
                                        submit for the consideration of the Governments of both
                                        countries a formula which is enlarged and in part revised,
                                        taking into consideration the desires of each in such a
                                        manner that without friction or injury to susceptibilities
                                        we might arrive at a definite agreement.</p>
                                    <p>“This formula provides that the Uruguayan officers divide
                                        their tasks, one proceeding to Fort Vanguardia and the other
                                        to Fort Boquerón, where the latter will await the
                                        reconstruction of the structures destroyed in that military
                                        post. Upon completion of this, the Bolivians will take
                                        possession of Vanguardia and the Paraguayans of Boquerón on
                                        the same day.</p>
                                    <p>“As the non-acceptance of this formula would signify a lack
                                        of good will, since there is only opposition to unimportant
                                        details, the Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in that
                                        event would withdraw from any further intervention. This
                                        would be most deplorable, for all the high aspirations of
                                        confraternity which have been manifested in the
                                        consideration of the problem and all the extensive work done
                                        to reach a happy solution in the meetings of the neutrals
                                        held in the United States capital would fall to the
                                        ground.</p>
                                    <p>“The discrepancies consist, I repeat, in slight details
                                        regarding the form in which the evacuation of Boquerón and
                                        the delivery of Vanguardia should be carried out. Our
                                        Government understands that as a proof of friendship and as
                                        the first act of a new era of peace this should be effected
                                        simultaneously.</p>
                                    <p>[“]It is to be hoped that the Uruguayan proposal will be
                                        accepted, since on the contrary it would mean a return to
                                        the moment of the beginning of the conflict, and this would
                                        be a constant menace to continental harmony.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister informed the press that his Government would
                                accept the proposal of the Uruguayan Government. The Paraguayan
                                Minister declined to comment, merely declaring that he was duly
                                forwarding the proposal to Asunción.</p>
                            <p>I shall not fail to keep the Department fully informed of future
                                developments in the matter.</p>

                                couple of weeks in order that an attempt might be made to induce

                                    <p>“I cherish the conviction that the Government of the United

                                        sincere respect which Paraguay gives to the terms of the
                                        protocol and of its decided disposition to fulfill them
                                        honorably. In the Conference of Montevideo the difficulty
                                        which has arisen consists in the exigency of Bolivia backed
                                        up by the Uruguayan Government that the work of
                                        reconstruction of Fort Vanguardia take place first; all that
                                        relates to the obligation in regard to Boquerón being
                                        suspended until that is all accomplished. The proposals made
                                        by the Paraguayan Government do not involve any provision of
                                        treaty for either interested parties.”</p>

                                regarding Uruguayan formula is your despatch No. 957, December 12,
                                and so transmitted it to the Legation at Asunción. The Minister
                                there states that the Minister for Foreign Affairs insists that the
                                Uruguayan formula as presented to the Paraguayan Government is not
                                exactly in accord with the understanding outlined by the Department.

                                Paraguay.</p>

                            <p>6. The Uruguayan mission, convinced that its viewpoint regarding
                                Paraguay was in error, accepted at this morning’s conference the
                                proposal offered by Paraguay, and a new arbitration agreement is now
                                being drafted accordingly. The Uruguayan mission has telegraphed its
                                Government stating that it favored acceptance in preference to
                                former formulas. The mission and the Foreign Office of Paraguay are

                                Chargé d’Affaires showed Department today a telegram from his
                                Government stating that it could not agree to the Uruguayan formula
                                because it would create a very bad precedent if Paraguay should
                                accept something that Bolivia wanted in order that Bolivia might
                                accept some other suggestion. To do this Paraguay would continually
                                have to give up its position on the theory that otherwise Bolivia
                                would not cooperate in bringing about a settlement. You will please
                                point out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this Government
                                first suggested the acceptance of the Uruguayan proposal on January
                                6, and that the present supposed outbreak in the Chaco did not take
                                place until January 20,<note n="33a" xml:id="d280fn33a">See

                            <p>The Department suggested the acceptance of the Uruguayan proposal
                                because it felt that that proposal offers a practicable solution of
                                the difficulty; that a refusal to carry it out would bring about an
                                impasse in the execution of the conciliation agreement signed by
                                both Paraguay and Bolivia on September 12, last. Bolivia having
                                accepted the Uruguayan suggestion, a refusal on the part of Paraguay
                                might make the latter appear as refusing to carry out the
                                conciliation agreement duly signed by it. Department therefore hopes
                                that the Paraguayan Government will see its way clear to accepting
                                the Uruguayan proposal. Please report by cable.</p>

                                that as a reason for not considering the note sent by the neutral

                                sufficient importance to allow it possibly to jeopardize a
                                settlement of the Chaco question.</p>

                                Affairs today informed me that he has just received a letter from
                                Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs containing two formulas. One
                                formula, which had already been rejected by both Uruguay and
                                Bolivia, proposed that Boquerón be turned over to Paraguay before
                                the completion of Vanguardia. This will not even be reconsidered.
                                The other formula merely proposes that the Uruguayan Government
                                appoint two army officers to proceed, with the consent of the
                                Governments of Bolivia and of Paraguay, to Forts Vanguardia and
                                Boquerón and to be present at the execution of the measures designed
                                to restore the state of things which existed prior to December 5,
                                1928. As this is nothing more than a repetition of article 5 of the
                                resolution of conciliation and completely ignores the whole dispute
                                as to the manner of carrying out the protocol, the Uruguayan <pb

                                has telegraphed to the Paraguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs

                                Foreign Affairs in order to prevent misunderstanding or possible

                            <p>You may say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Department,

                                in Washington, has been constantly urging on the Paraguayan
                                Government acceptance of the Uruguayan formula and it has suggested
                                to the other neutral Governments that they do likewise. Please say
                                to the Minister that the Department also feels that it would be very
                                helpful if the Uruguayan Government would urge the Bolivian
                                Government to accept one of the proposals made in the neutral
                                Governments’ communication of January 9th. This Government has done
                                so and is informing the other neutrals thereof and is suggesting
                                that they also could help the situation materially by making similar
                                representations. Please cable action taken by Uruguay.</p>

                                President, developed into a prolonged conversation on the Chaco
                                situation. I expressed the continued concern of my Government and
                                its profound hope that peace would be maintained and he <pb n="317"
                                    xml:id="pg_317" facs="0397"/>repeated with the greatest
                                earnestness that Paraguay had made every reasonable concession and
                                desired nothing further so much as a quick settlement. The Legation
                                lacks record of action taken on the Department’s telegrams numbers
                                1, 4, and 5 of January 6th,<note n="38" xml:id="d284fn1">See

                                familiarity with them. As to telegram number 1, he states that the
                                Department somewhat misunderstood the Uruguayan proposal which in
                                fact provided not that the Uruguayan officers should divide their
                                tasks but that they should proceed together, first to Vanguardia and
                                then to Boquerón. As to telegram number 4, he remarked that the
                                rains unfortunately would not prevent attacks on isolated outposts
                                and that regarding reduction Bolivia’s forces at certain forts it is
                                the expectation that the troops withdrawn will be replaced by new.
                                His point of view is that if the neutral commissioners did not
                                contemplate simultaneous action neither is there any indication that
                                they contemplated that Vanguardia should be restored before
                                Boquerón. I believe this Government is too strongly committed to the
                                principle of simultaneous action to yield this point. What could
                                have been waived at the outset without great difficulty has become
                                more difficult to yield since the agreement upon the new formula was
                                reached here by the Uruguayan Special Mission and the Paraguayan
                                Foreign Office. (See Legation’s telegrams No. 6, January 13, 5 [<hi

                            <p>This morning the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me, in
                                strictest confidence, the Uruguayan Foreign Office has now accepted
                                this new formula but that in so doing it expresses the desire “that
                                there be added to the Paraguayan formula the declaration that the
                                Uruguayan Government shall retain complete liberty to give to its
                                officials such instructions as it deems appropriate”. To this he is
                                at present disposed to object on the ground that proper liberty of
                                action is given them by the terms of the agreement itself. Dr.
                                Higinio Arbo, the newly appointed Minister to Uruguay, left for his
                                post today. In the face of the rumors of continued activity of
                                Bolivian patrols in the Vanguardia sector the Government here shows
                                complete patience and calmness. The movement reported in the

                            <p>8. Referring to the Department’s telegram of February 14, 6 p.m., No.
                                10. I have today informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs as
                                directed. He declared that he believes from various previous
                                conversations with Bolivian Minister that the Bolivian Government
                                would make no reply to the neutral governments’ communication of
                                January 9th until agreement has been reached with Paraguay regarding
                                manner of exchanging forts. However, he agreed to make oral
                                representations, as suggested by the Department, to the Bolivian
                                Government tomorrow, pointing out that in case the negotiations here
                                regarding fulfillment of Washington protocol should be unsuccessful
                                it would be advisable to have a commission to fall back upon in
                                order to prevent serious developments.</p>
                            <p>With reference to telegram of February 15, 3 p.m., from the Legation
                                at Asunción to the Department, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                again confirmed that Uruguayan proposal is, as transmitted in my
                                telegram of January 10, 2 p.m., No. 5, namely, that one officer
                                should proceed to Vanguardia and one officer to Boquerón dividing
                                their tasks. Since the restoration of Vanguardia would take several
                                weeks and the relinquishment of Boquerón only a few minutes, he did
                                not see how more simultaneous action could be devised than as
                                provided in the Uruguayan formula by which means the acts of
                                proceedings of the completion of Vanguardia and the abandonment of
                                Boquerón would be drawn up simultaneously.</p>
                            <p>The new Paraguayan Minister to Uruguay, Señor Arbo, is expected to
                                present his credentials some time next week and bring with him a
                                reply to the Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs’ last
                                telegram.</p>

                                why it cannot accept the so-called double arbitration. It reiterates
                                Bolivia’s adherence to the principle of arbitration and its
                                willingness to arbitrate the present dispute once the extent of the
                                territory to be submitted to the arbitrator is agreed upon. Note
                                terminates with following paragraph:</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>You will note that this reply is favorable to a discussion of the
                                matter between Bolivian and Paraguayan representatives in Washington
                                as soon as the conciliation agreement of September 12, is carried
                                out. It is the Department’s understanding that the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs of Paraguay suggested to Sampognaro, the Uruguayan
                                agent, that a protocol be signed in Montevideo which will be limited
                                merely to designating the Uruguayan officers and the date of their
                                departure for Boquerón and Vanguardia and will mention the
                                commission’s object quoting clause 5 of the Resolution of
                                Conciliation of September 12. In proposing this statement to
                                Sampognaro the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Paraguay stated
                                that, “If the Uruguayan Government wishes the protocol to lay down
                                in detail the procedure of the execution of the obligations,
                                although this is unnecessary, the Paraguayan Government will be
                                obliged to insist on its previous formula whereby on the day the
                                work commences at Fort Vanguardia Bolivia will abandon Boqueron
                                which will not be occupied by Paraguay until the work at Vanguardia
                                terminates. The Uruguayan Government has those to choose from.” The
                                Department understands that Sampognaro expressed his preference for
                                the former. Department feels that through the first proposal
                                Paraguay in effect puts the matter back in the hands of Uruguay and
                                thereby tacitly consents to have Uruguay proceed on the basis of the
                                Uruguayan formula. The Conciliation Agreement of September 12, gave
                                full latitude to Uruguay as to the manner of its execution. This
                                freedom of action was somewhat trammelled by the recent negotiations
                                but now that Paraguay accepts in its first formula to return to the
                                exact wording of the Conciliation Agreement Department feels that a
                                way out of the difficulty is now offered through the acceptance of
                                the Paraguayan suggestion, which it presumes is acceptable to
                                Bolivian representative in Montevideo as it is nothing more than a
                                return to the Conciliation Agreement and that if the proposed
                                protocol is promptly signed in Montevideo the Uruguayan Government
                                could then proceed to send its officers to Boqueron and Vanguardia
                                and carry out the provisions of the Conciliation Agreement through
                                the repair of Vanguardia and the return of that Fort and Fort
                                Boqueron to Bolivia and Paraguay respectively.</p>

                            <p>By this action Uruguay would contribute greatly to the establishment
                                of permanent peace between the two countries by removing this
                                obstacle to the discussion of the settlement of fundamental question
                                at issue between Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>

                            <p>10. Department’s telegram number 11, March 6, 4 p.m. I have duly
                                discussed Paraguayan suggestion to Sampognaro with the Minister of
                                Foreign Affairs and informed him of the Department’s views thereon.
                                He declared that in view of the words “with the consent of the
                                Governments of Bolivia and of Paraguay” in article No. 5 of the
                                conciliation agreement he did not consider that Uruguayan Government
                                ever had such full liberty of action in carrying out the terms of
                                the protocol. He believed that specific consent to the Uruguayan
                                officers’ instructions was necessary from Bolivia and Paraguay.
                                While displaying keen interest in the Department’s interpretation of
                                article 5, he expressed doubt as to whether the two contending
                                Governments and the neutrals’ tribunal unreservedly agree as to the
                                scope of Uruguay’s authority and expressed regret that the protocol
                                was not clearly defined.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs finally declared that he would
                                propose to the Bolivian and Paraguayan representatives here that
                                they make a declaration to the effect that they interpret article 5
                                of the conciliation agreement as permitting Uruguay to give the
                                necessary instructions in the matter to its officers. If the
                                Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers accept this proposal, the
                                Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs will immediately instruct the
                                officers to proceed to Boquerón and Vanguardia to assist in
                                fulfilling the protocol according to the Uruguayan formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to inform me of the results
                                of his proposal.</p>

                            <p>11. My telegram 10, March 10, 10 a.m. Uruguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs has just informed me that, in lieu of proposing that the
                                Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers make a declaration interpreting
                                article No. 5 of the conciliation agreement, he had deemed it
                                preferable to make the following proposals this afternoon: That the
                                Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers sign a protocol to the effect that
                                in accordance with article No. 5 of the conciliation agreement they
                                thereby grant the Uruguayan Government authorization to give ample
                                instructions to its officers with respect to the fulfillment of the
                                terms of the Washington protocol.</p>
                            <p>Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs also proposed that in this or
                                in a second protocol the Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers agree
                                that their countries renew diplomatic relations by appointing
                                Ministers on April 10th, transmitting the agreements through the
                                Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>While both the Bolivian and Paraguayan Ministers expressed approval
                                of these proposals, they wished to telegraph their Governments for
                                and [<hi rend="italic">authorization?</hi>] to conclude the
                                agreement.</p>
                            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs is highly optimistic that the protocol
                                will be signed within a few days. He allowed me to read formula but
                                declined to furnish copy of the text pending the Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan replies as slight changes may be necessary.</p>

                            <p>12. My telegram No. 11, March 10, 8 p.m. The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs informed me this afternoon that the Paraguayan Government
                                has accepted his proposal. A favorable reply from the Bolivian
                                Government is expected at any time.</p>

                                been unable to see him. Bolivian Minister informed me this morning
                                that his Government has authorized him to sign protocol but amending
                                it to fix May 1 instead of April 10 as the date for the renewal of

                            <p>I believe delay in signing is due either to the illness of the

                            <p>15. Your 17, March 27, 2 p.m. Department sincerely hopes that a
                                settlement between Bolivia and Paraguay will not be jeopardized by a
                                quibble over wording. Department confidently hopes that the
                                Government of Uruguay will not wish to imperil a settlement by
                                taking any such categorical stand in the matter as last sentence of

                            <p>Department does not understand why the formula was changed after it
                                had been accepted by Paraguay. Paraguay accepted the Uruguayan
                                formula and if Paraguay does not accept a modified form thereof
                                Department hopes that the Uruguayan Government will not stand out
                                for that change but will revert to original suggestion which was
                                accepted by Paraguay and the Department understands by Bolivia also.
                                Please clarify the situation.</p>

                                Minister for Foreign Affairs on March tenth submitted to the

                                protocol of Washington and fixing April 10, 1930, as the date for
                                the renewal of diplomatic relations. This proposal was accepted by
                                Paraguay on March 14th. On March 18th the Bolivian Government
                                authorized its Minister to sign the protocol but with slight changes
                                in wording and amending it to fix May first instead of April 10th as
                                the date for the renewal of diplomatic relations. The Paraguayan
                                Minister, Dr. Higinio Arbo, agreed that the changes in wording were
                                immaterial but objected to the date May first as being too distant,
                                and declared that he would have to submit the text of the Bolivian
                                acceptance to his government.</p>
                            <p>In an interview on March 27th, the Uruguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs, Senor Dominguez, informed me that the Paraguayan Government
                                had not yet replied … He felt that the date May first was not
                                unreasonable in view of the fact that the ministers would need a
                                short time to wind up their affairs before proceeding to their
                                respective posts. While no objections to the wording had been
                                received from the Paraguayan Government, Senor Dominguez had
                                confidentially learned from the Uruguayan Chargé d’Affaires at
                                Asuncion that such would probably be made. He expressed keen
                                disappointment and disapproval over the Paraguayan attitude and
                                informed me that if the Paraguayan Government did not accept, the
                                Uruguayan Government would make no further efforts in the
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Diario del Plata</hi>, a Nacionalista newspaper
                                of Montevideo, on March 28th contained an editorial criticizing
                                Paraguay for not replying. On the following day the Paraguayan
                                Minister in an open letter answered that his government had sent a
                                reply but owing to his absence in Buenos Aires it had not been
                                delivered. He presented the Paraguayan acceptance with slight
                                changes in wording to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the same day
                                (My telegram No. 20, March 29, 1930).</p>
                            <p>As already stated, the protocol was duly signed on April fourth.

                                <p>On April fourth, nineteen hundred and thirty, convened in the
                                    office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, Don
                                    Rufino T. Dominguez, and in his presence, the Envoys
                                    Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary of Bolivia and

                                    respectively, with the object of continuing the Conversation
                                    begun on November thirteenth last, regarding the instructions
                                    which should be furnished the Uruguayan officers who in
                                    accordance with the fifth article of the resolution drafted by
                                    the Commission of Investigation and Conciliation Bolivia and
                                    Paraguay, should proceed to Forts Vanguardia and Boquerón, both
                                    diplomats declare that “with the purpose of hastening the
                                    execution of the stipulations of the Bolivian-Paraguayan
                                    protocol signed in Washington on September 12, 1929, the
                                    Governments of both countries agree: To accord the Government of
                                    Uruguay sufficient authority in order that it may give the
                                    instructions to the officers whom it is to designate, in
                                    accordance with Article 5 of the resolution, to be present at
                                    the execution of the terms of the same, those instructions
                                    having to be in conformity with the provisions and text of the
                                    above-mentioned resolution of September 12, 1929.” Both
                                    diplomats further agree that in view of the friendly suggestions
                                    offered by the Government of Uruguay, the Governments of
                                    Paraguay and Bolivia resolved to fix the date of May first next
                                    for the effective renewal of diplomatic relations between both,

                                    to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay that it be good

                                    Bolivian and Paraguayan points of view which were unfolded

                                January 9. You will accordingly present the note on that date. The
                                Mexican Government suggested a modification in the ninth paragraph
                                of the note and this modification has been accepted by all the
                                neutral Governments. Paragraph nine of the note transmitted in the
                                Department’s December 6, 4 p.m. should therefore be changed to read
                                as follows: “Noting with pleasure that the Government of Bolivia
                                expects to inform them of its acceptance of their offer of good

                                be of service to the two Governments concerned. In the meantime, in

                                contending Governments, they take pleasure in stating that they are
                                willing that their diplomatic representatives in Washington keep in

                            <p>2. Department’s telegram number 2, January 6, 5 p.m. I presented the
                                note as instructed but I do not believe it will receive serious
                                consideration from the President for some time due to the internal
                                political situation. During the past two weeks the President has had
                                continuous conferences with members of his own party and it now
                                seems certain that in place of calling for elections he will
                                endeavor to remain in office. No announcement has yet been made, as
                                apparently he has not decided the exact method nor is he sure of the
                                entire support of the army. There is a strong feeling against his
                                continuance but the pressure is so great in his own party, which has
                                no other candidate, in addition to his own ambition, that he has
                                been persuaded. There is no way of making such a step
                                constitutional. Should he in fact endeavor to continue in office
                                there are certain to be political disturbances between now and May
                                which, unless he can count on the entire army, he will be unable to
                                    control.<note n="49" xml:id="d297fn49">See “Revolution in

                            <p>14. (1) When Mr. Robert Woods Bliss, Ambassador in Argentina, paid
                                his respects to President Leguia, accompanied by me, the President
                                spoke at considerable length regarding the Chaco dispute. He had
                                been informed of the engagement in the Chaco which had resulted in a
                                number of casualties and felt that this precipitated a most
                                difficult and unfortunate situation. He several times repeated his
                                considered opinion that the Government of the United States should
                                take matters in hand and address the Governments of Bolivia and
                                Paraguay very firmly to the effect that this situation must cease
                                and that the questions involved should be settled by arbitration
                                with plenary powers to determine all matters in dispute once and for
                                all. The President observed, in this connection, that he was firmly
                                of the opinion that despite newspaper reports and statements to the
                                contrary and apparent attitudes dictated by local political
                                consideration the Latin American Republics at heart believed that
                                the United States of America was the one disinterested power capable
                                of exercising a beneficent influence on Latin American affairs.</p>
                            <p>(2) President Leguia stated in continuation that if, as he considered
                                not unlikely, an actual state of war resulted from present
                                conditions in the Chaco, the prestige of the United States in Latin
                                America, as well as in Europe, could not but suffer immeasurably. He
                                added, that as the Government of the United States must know, he
                                stood ready to give wholehearted support to any move we might
                                make.</p>
                            <p>(3) Ambassador Bliss felt as I did that this conversation should be
                                brought immediately to the attention of the Department.</p>

                            <p>3. Department’s telegram No. 5, January 20, 1 p.m.<note n="52"
                                    xml:id="d301fn1">Not printed.</note> and 7, January 22, 6 p.m.
                                Official Bolivian communiqué states that on January 16 a squadron of
                                60 Paraguayan troops armed with machine guns attacked Bolivian
                                observation post of 12 men north of Fort Boquerón dispersing them
                                and killing one. Bolivian troops from Boquerón later repelled the
                                attack. All blame for the aggression has been placed on Paraguay.
                                The general opinion here, in which I concur, is that the attack was
                                provoked by Bolivia on account of the internal political situation.
                                As previously reported President Siles desires to continue in
                                office. In order to postpone elections and justify such action a
                                national emergency must be declared. An attack by Paraguay can be
                                used as a pretext for such a declaration. Before the publication
                                here on January 20 of news of the attack in the Chaco the Cabinet
                                met and decided to call Congress for the purpose of declaring a
                                national emergency. The reception of the news, however, was so
                                apathetic in spite of attempts by the Government press to <pb
                                    n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0411"/>arouse public feeling that
                                this decision has been temporarily suspended. President Siles now
                                seems undecided as to his next move as the last has been too
                                transparent even in Bolivia. The Nationalist Party and a large part
                                of the army on which he must depend for continuance in office are
                                strongly urging him to take further drastic action. The desire of
                                the Military Party is obviously not altogether patriotic, as further
                                military action in the Chaco requires money and the army is the
                                first to be paid at all times. 250,000 bolivianos have already been
                                drawn since January 16 from the extraordinary budget for the use of
                                the army.</p>
                            <p>There are two Bolivian divisions scattered through the Chaco
                                approximating 4,000 men. Much of the war material purchased from
                                Vickers has been concentrated there. Five planes equipped with bombs
                                have been ordered there from La Paz but have been unable to proceed
                                due to weather and mechanical difficulties. It is admitted here that
                                radio messages from the General Staff have been intercepted and
                                deciphered by Paraguay. My opinion is that some of these were for
                                use in case of further hostilities and that others were fabricated
                                as a ruse. I do not think there is danger of further armed action by
                                Bolivia immediately as the effect of the last has not been what
                                Siles anticipated either here or abroad. However, troops in the
                                Chaco are far from central control, communications are bad and
                                hotheaded officers acting irresponsibly may precipitate trouble at
                                any time.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the publication of the notes I believe that it would
                                jeopardize Bolivia’s acceptance of the good offices or of the
                                suggestion contained in the last paragraph of the note of January 9
                                as it would be made to appear here that Bolivia was being forced;
                                that the neutrals were in fact favorable to Paraguay and that
                                Bolivia must stand alone. This might strengthen Siles’ hand by
                                concentrating opinion behind him.</p>

                            <p>9. Your 3, January 24, noon. You do not state whether you made the
                                representations authorized in the first paragraph of the
                                Department’s 7, January 22, 6 p.m., and if so the reaction of
                                Bolivian Government. In view of your statement that you concur in
                                the opinion, which you state is general in La Paz, that the attack
                                was provoked by Bolivia on account of the internal political
                                situation, the Department desires you to call at once on the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs and tell him that the Department has
                                been watching the situation developing in the Chaco with much
                                concern and that it feels sure that Bolivia will not desire a
                                renewal of hostilities there which cannot be of benefit to either
                                country but is bound to react disastrously on both countries and
                                that this Government therefore earnestly hopes that the Bolivian
                                Government will find it possible to accept now one of the
                                suggestions made by the neutral governments in their note of January
                                9. Please cable immediately result of your representations.</p>
                            <p>The Department considers the situation serious and wants to impress
                                upon you the importance of following it closely and of keeping the
                                Department promptly and frequently advised of all developments.</p>

                            <p>4. Department’s telegram No. 9, January 25, 1 p.m. I spoke to the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning at 10, not having been
                                able to see him yesterday. I repeated to him the contents of the
                                telegram under acknowledgment and left with him an <hi rend="italic"
                                    >aide-mémoire</hi> in the same sense. I stated that the present
                                seemed a most propitious time to accept one of the suggestions made
                                by the neutral Governments and that such action would place Bolivia
                                in a most favorable light. He replied that the Bolivian Army was
                                under the complete control of the Government and that there was no
                                danger of any hostilities on the part of Bolivia. Orders had been
                                sent to all contingents in the Chaco to be ready to repulse any
                                attack but to provoke or make none. All alarming messages had been
                                sent out by Paraguay to prejudice the situation and for reasons of
                                internal politics. The Bolivian War Office also had intercepted
                                Paraguayan messages which could be made to appear equally damaging
                                but the Bolivian Government refused to publish them. He stated that
                                he attached no importance to a brief encounter of patrols in a
                                disputed territory as it had been common all over the world where
                                such conditions existed. The agitation of Paraguay was due to the
                                fear that Bolivia would make reprisals as she had done in the case
                                of Boquerón. This fear was unfounded as Bolivia would maintain peace
                                but was prepared to repel any aggression.</p>
                            <p>I asked if the Bolivian Government had as yet had time to study the
                                note of the neutral Governments of January 9. He replied that it had
                                not as the results of the representations of the Uruguayan
                                Government relative to the completion of the terms of the
                                conciliation agreement were being awaited. I asked if the present
                                incident would further delay consideration of the note and he
                                agreed.</p>
                            <p>The press is strictly censored but the tone has been very moderate in
                                the last few days. The public is not excited. Business circles are
                                exerting pressure against military action because of the already
                                depressed financial condition. Siles has not yet announced his plans
                                but as elections must be called according to the electoral law on
                                February 2nd some announcement may be made this week.</p>

                            <p>8. My telegram No. 5, January 30, 10 a.m.<note n="59"
                                    xml:id="d306fn59">Not printed.</note> In spite of President
                                Siles’ statements and promises he has not yet considered the note of
                                January 9. I have used every argument I can muster … The Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs is in favor of acceptance but is unable to
                                persuade the President. Public opinion as far as I am able to
                                ascertain is also in favor. The President is still so occupied with
                                the internal political situation that he can think of nothing else.
                                What he will do is still a matter of conjecture. He leaves tomorrow
                                for Potosi and will be away a week. There is no chance that the note
                                will be considered until after his return. The situation in the
                                Chaco appears to be quiet and there has been no further troop
                                movement there. Three Breguet planes have now reached Villazon.</p>

                            <p>The Brazilian Government have adopted the invariable method of not
                                assuming in the Bolivian-Paraguayan controversy any ostensible role.
                                The Government are of the opinion that the Brazilian contribution to
                                a pacific settlement of the dispute between the two neighbors will
                                be more efficient as a result of our unassuming attitude in the
                                matter. Such attitude allows Brazil to speak frankly both to Bolivia
                                and Paraguay, as well as to the other intervening friendly
                                countries, with the most perfect cordiality, without even the
                                semblance of any suspicion or giving cause to misplaced
                                interpretations. The Brazilian Government, whenever approached by
                                Bolivia and Paraguay, in informal conversations, have always tried
                                to support the diplomatic action of the United States Government.
                                This has been done recently in conversations with Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>We deem it proper that our feelings in the matter should be known by
                                the United States Government although we are convinced that any
                                amount of success to which we could be a factor derives precisely
                                from the fact that we do not actually intervene for reasons of
                                neighborhood and on account of recent Treaties, which are
                                well-known, so as to place us entirely without the range of the
                                slightest appearance of urging for ourselves any attitude of
                                evidence.</p>
                            <p>In bringing our views to the knowledge of the United States
                                Government in an informal conversation, it is our desire, for the
                                sake of historical truth, as well as in a testimony of the friendly
                                interest we attach to the actions of the enlightened and friendly
                                diplomacy of the United States in the pending controversy between
                                Bolivia and Paraguay, to acquaint the Government in Washington with
                                our views and to express that our action, no matter how quiet it has
                                been and in fact is, finds its efficiency in our sincere wishes for
                                the success of the diplomatic action of the United States in the
                                Bolivian-Paraguayan controversy.</p>

                            <p>12. My telegram No. 8, February 1, noon. The President returned from
                                Potosi Tuesday after what the Government newspapers call a triumphal
                                reception. He has not taken up the matter of the neutral note either
                                during his absence or since his return.</p>
                            <p>A [<hi rend="italic">The</hi>] Nationalist Party has issued a
                                manifesto containing the following statement: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Nationalist Party unanimously, with the sole exception
                                        of its founder, Dr. Hernando Siles, who has not yet been
                                        convinced, believes that, in view of the grave international
                                        situation provoked by Paraguay and the present chaotic state
                                        of internal politics, it is of the greatest public advantage
                                        in order to prevent anarchy and maintain peace which will
                                        assure the external defense of the country to execute a
                                        legal extension of the Presidential term of Dr. Siles until
                                        the situation becomes normal and the Nationalist Government
                                        is able to advance its wide constructive program and
                                        national consolidation.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>It is evident that the Nationalist Party intends to prolong the
                                Presidential term and the reluctance of Siles is only a pretense.
                                The party has recovered from the first fright produced by the
                                repercussion of the last Chaco incident and will now carry out its
                                original program. The press is more rigidly censored and the most
                                restrictive measures have been taken against all who express any
                                opinion against the administration or are even suspected of doing
                                so. For this reason the Republican Party has temporarily abandoned
                                its convention to choose a Presidential candidate and it will
                                probably never be held.</p>
                            <p>I believe the President will continue to delay consideration of the
                                last neutral note since the principal reason for his continuance in
                                office is the grave international crisis provoked by the alleged
                                Paraguayan attack and any acceptance of good offices on his part
                                would be construed as weakening his party’s position.</p>
                            <p>Although in urging him to accept I have always pointed out that the
                                United States is only animated by a friendly desire to see this old
                                controversy amicably settled, I am constantly confronted with the
                                expressed or implied feeling that the United States is exerting
                                pressure for reasons of its imperialistic South American policy. As
                                far as I can learn I am the only representative in La Paz who has
                                urged acceptance. Would it be possible to suggest to the other
                                neutral Governments that their representatives also be instructed to
                                keep this matter actively before the President?</p>

                                Affairs has been ill in bed for the past 10 days. The Under
                                Secretary for Foreign Affairs informs me that a special Cabinet
                                meeting had been called to draft an answer to the note of the
                                neutral Governments of January 9, but that it has been postponed
                                until the Minister for Foreign Affairs is able to attend. As the
                                President is well aware of the Foreign Minister’s views, this in my
                                opinion is only another excuse for delay.</p>
                            <p>Last night the central committee of the Nationalist Party and all
                                departmental representatives met formally and unanimously declared
                                themselves in favor of the continuance of the present
                                administration, thus formalizing the manifesto previously
                                circulated. All that is needed now is the President’s consent which
                                will probably be given within the next week. The delay is due to a
                                desire to find some way by which such a step can produce a semblance
                                of constitutionality or, failing that, to permit artificially
                                stimulated propaganda make such a move appear to be the unanimous
                                will of the people.</p>
                            <p>Conditions in the Chaco appear to be quiet. Two of the planes sent
                                there are now out of commission. The floods are reported to be
                                heavy.</p>

                                the diplomatic representatives of Bolivia and Paraguay Embassies. In
                                my opinion this is not clear in the note which I have now translated
                                in full and am coding. He further stated that he had entire
                                confidence in the justice of the United States but would naturally
                                take every precaution to safeguard the rights of Bolivia.</p>

                                        Boreal. In the note under reference, the Governments of the
                                        five neutral nations deem it justifiable to formulate some
                                        opinions regarding the scope of the negotiations initiated,
                                        making clear certain opinions in order to avoid ambiguous

                                        nevertheless considers that to proceed logically both as a

                                        instituting the Commission of Inquiry and Conciliation.
                                        After a lengthy trial and a contradictory examination of
                                        facts, Bolivia and Paraguay subscribed to the conciliatory
                                        pact of September 12th, 1929, whose text establishes that
                                        the events of Vanguardia preceded those which took place in
                                        the Boquerón sector; that the use of coercive methods by
                                        Paraguay were responsible for reaction on the part of
                                        Bolivia; and as a consequence states that Paraguay must
                                        restore the buildings of Vanguardia and Bolivian troops
                                        abandon Fort Boquerón.</p>
                                    <p>Having circumscribed the authority of the Commission at
                                        Washington to the procedure of investigation of the events
                                        of the Chaco at the end of 1928, excluding study and
                                        judgment of the territorial controversy, by clause 9 of the
                                        protocol of January 3rd, 1929, will it be practicable to
                                        initiate discussions of the case “if the resolutions, the
                                        subject of its exclusive jurisdiction, have not been
                                        fulfilled?</p>
                                    <p>In the course of the lengthy debate over the ownership of the
                                        Chaco, Bolivia has shown her desire to find just solutions.
                                        She has subscribed to pacts and submitted herself to
                                        procedure which prove it. Recent incidents in themselves are
                                        an unquestionable proof of her sincere desire to disentangle
                                        the difficulties. On January 16th of the current year an
                                        unfortunate incident took place on the Bolivian-Paraguayan
                                        military frontier; a patrol of Paraguayan soldiers, composed
                                        of 60 men armed with machine guns fired on and scattered a
                                        small Bolivian detachment in the neighborhood of Boquerón,
                                        causing one death. This new aggression is inexplicable at a
                                        time when peace was asserting itself, and proves the
                                        deliberate intention of Paraguay to rebel against the
                                        conciliation pact of Washington and to frustrate an
                                        agreement to which the good faith of the contending parties
                                        and that of the supreme authority of the neutrals
                                        intervening therein, was bound. Paraguay and Bolivia almost
                                        simultaneously carried their complaints to the League of
                                        Nations. My Government did so because Bolivia, as a
                                        signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, has certain
                                        international legal obligations to the League. Faithful to
                                        her pacifist traditions, she agreed to form part in [<hi

                                        acts of violence in the intercourse of nations, to raise
                                        amongst them the empire of justice and to solve their
                                        difficulties by the conciliatory methods proclaimed by the
                                        rights of peoples.</p>
                                    <p>The Ministry in my charge has noted with most [<hi
                                            rend="italic">much</hi>] interest and attention the

                                        judgment later on the boundary question itself, is
                                        discarded. Bolivia only reaffirms the reserve with which she
                                        signed the general treaty of arbitration of January 5th of

                                    <p>Bolivia on different occasions in her history has shown her
                                        enthusiasm for and faith in the international institution of
                                        arbitration and in spite of the fact that numerous authors
                                        of treatises on international law agree that controversies
                                        affecting the honor or sovereignty of nations cannot be
                                        subject to arbitration, entrusted to the judgment of
                                        friendly nations differences of territorial sovereignty. At
                                        present, in her dispute with the Republic of Paraguay, not
                                        only does she agree but has definitely decided to resort to
                                        those means. But her adherence to the principles of
                                        arbitration cannot reach the extreme of submitting
                                        territorial zones, unquestionable part of the national
                                        patrimony, to the decision of third parties, although she
                                        greatly appreciates their probity and Pan American spirit,
                                        as in the case under reference, she has particular
                                        satisfaction in doing.</p>
                                    <p>Neither the nation nor the Bolivian Government could accept
                                        such an arbitration, nor in general terms could any Bolivian
                                        public servant be capable of undertaking such a great
                                        responsibility.</p>
                                    <p>Concerning territorial sovereignty, that is to say of the
                                        country itself, it is not possible in any way to leave to an
                                        unrestricted judgment the determination of the territory
                                        under litigation. Bolivia cannot follow blindly, without
                                        previously knowing what territory she delivers to the
                                        judgment of the arbitrators, or without establishing this as
                                        a basis first in an absolute and undoubted manner.</p>

                                        Bolivia and Paraguay agreed that the parties ‘would
                                        determine the exact zone on which the judgment of [the]
                                        tribunal of arbitration, chosen by common accord, would be
                                        given.’ Therefore, the direct negotiations were charged with
                                        determining in concrete form the boundaries of the territory
                                        under litigation, and on this basis previously decided, the
                                        tribunal of arbitration should pronounce judgment. But as it
                                        is possible that the determining of such a zone will be the
                                        obstacle which will defeat the negotiations, [the]
                                        Government of Bolivia, filled with a desire for a sincere
                                        agreement, has proposed a formula which takes into
                                        consideration not only equity but the historic tradition of
                                        the controversy. This arbitration, proceeding from the law
                                        of treaties, consists, as I made known to Your Excellency in
                                        my note of November 13th, in taking the middle point of the
                                        demarcation established in the three agreements signed
                                        between Paraguay and Bolivia in 1879, in 1887, and in
                                            1894.<note n="72" xml:id="d312fn72">For texts, see

                                        course of half a century of negotiations to arrive at a
                                        Bolivian-Paraguayan agreement.</p>

                                        respect for territorial right which within certain limits
                                        cannot be discussed, such a formula would supply the means
                                        which would make arbitration practicable.</p>

                                    <p>The arguments stated above will justify before the
                                        enlightened opinion of the neutral nations the attitude of
                                        Bolivia which is making an effort to find an equitable
                                        solution of a litigation and the justice of the objections
                                        made to unlimited arbitration. As regards the latter, an
                                        antecedent which gives greater force to the argument is
                                        worthy of mention. The Commission of Conciliation at
                                        Washington, unable by article 9 of the protocol of January
                                        3, 1929, to discuss the territorial side of the question, in
                                        a laudable endeavor to solve the litigation completely,
                                        proposed a compromise frontier line from Puerto Leda on the
                                        Paraguay River to Fort D’Orbigny on the Pilcomayo River. A
                                        careful examination of the suggestion shows that it
                                        possesses nothing in the nature of a compromise. To
                                        compromise means mutual renouncement and common sacrifice in
                                        pursuit of an ideal of concord. In this proposal summary
                                            [<hi rend="italic">such a</hi>] course was only expected
                                        of Bolivia. Taking the line of the Quijarro-Decoud Treaty as
                                        a basis of comparison, Paraguay preserved her penetration in
                                        the Chaco authorized by it, but without granting to Bolivia
                                        an equivalent advance up to the mouth of the River Apa, the
                                        western line being granted to Paraguay. The compensations of
                                        a river coast were expressly denied to Bolivia, and she had
                                        to renounce about one and a half geographic degrees on the
                                        banks of the Paraguay River.</p>
                                    <p>The so-called compromise line suggested does not take into
                                        consideration strict right nor conventional right which it
                                        destroys, nor even equity. It seriously impairs the
                                        situation of Bolivia, disposes freely of her territory
                                        without offering her the compensation of an equivalent
                                        fluvial territory. If such a suggestion had its origin in
                                        the heart of a Commission not empowered to examine the
                                        fundamental issue, what may transpire before an organization
                                        empowered by definite authority to exert its influence in
                                        the delineation of the territory which must be submitted to
                                        arbitration?</p>
                                    <p>It is true that in order to remove any doubts, Your
                                        Excellency is good enough to state the right of each of the
                                        parties to retire from the negotiations should the formula
                                        of the understanding be unsatisfactory. My Government
                                        believes that such a step would seriously affect the
                                        authority of the neutral nations and the prestige of the
                                        country which might try it. The formula, though adverse to
                                        the one damaged by it, would establish a precedent which due
                                        to the strength of its high origin would weaken legal
                                        titles, jealousy defended, and the Government who would
                                        dissent from such opinions would appear refractory to the
                                        ideas of international concord.</p>
                                    <p>These reasons, which will be appreciated to the full by the
                                        neutral governments, induce Bolivia to reaffirm irrevocably
                                        the reserves set forth in her note of November 13th, 1929,
                                        regarding the necessity to establish concrete grounds for
                                        the functioning of the Commission.</p>
                                    <p>My Government wishes to place on record its gratitude for the
                                        generous and disinterested efforts made by the five neutral
                                        powers to solve the difficulties unhappily existing between
                                        Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia recognizes the lofty aims of
                                        the five sister nations. And it is thus that she receives
                                        with pleasure the suggestion to initiate conversations
                                        between the diplomatic representatives of Bolivia and
                                        Paraguay accredited to the Government of the United States.
                                        Notwithstanding the fact that for reasons foreign to
                                        Bolivia, Bolivian-Paraguayan relations have not yet been

                                        conciliation at Washington is executed, it will not be long
                                        before they are resumed. The practical means arrived at by
                                        the neutrals will probably lead us to the terms of an
                                        agreement. The conversations between the diplomats of
                                        Bolivia and Paraguay taking place in the quiet and
                                        propitious atmosphere of Washington, cooperating with those
                                        which will be begun in La Paz or Asunción, will give
                                        satisfactory results. My Government has faith and confidence
                                        in them and if they do not settle the territorial litigation
                                        itself, they will at least offer in concrete form the
                                        correct material upon which a subsequent arbitration may
                                        offer the last word.</p>
                                    <p>Begging Your Excellency to convey to the knowledge of the
                                        Government of the United States of America the tenor of this
                                        note and to reiterate Bolivia’s deepest gratitude for her
                                        laudable and generous effort, I have the honor to offer to

                            <p>16. Department feels that progress is being made and that the
                                penultimate paragraph of the note of February 25,<note n="73"
                                    xml:id="d313fn73">See telegram No. 16, February 27, 5 p.m., from

                                coupled with the statement of the President reported in your 15,
                                February 27, 3 p.m. and a similar statement made to the Department
                                by the Bolivian Minister on the third instant means that Bolivia
                                will, as soon as the conciliation agreement of September 12 is
                                carried out, initiate direct negotiations in Washington,
                                supplemented by similar negotiations in La Paz and/or Asunción.
                                Please call on the President and express the gratification of this
                                Government at the decision of the Bolivian Government in the
                                premises. At the same time you may discreetly point out that (1) the
                                settlement of the fundamental question at issue is not linked up
                                with the conciliation agreement, and (2) the conciliation agreement
                                offers no basis for delaying the establishment of diplomatic
                                relations pending the settlement of the questions of Boquerón and
                                Vanguardia.</p>
                            <p>In carrying out the above you will be very careful to avoid any
                                appearance of pressure on Bolivia or of attempting to hasten it
                                unduly in instituting direct negotiations in Washington.</p>
                            <p>For your information the Department interprets the recent statement
                                of Paraguay as giving complete freedom of action to Uruguay and
                                tacitly accepting the Uruguayan formula for carrying out the
                                agreement of September 12, as regards Boqueron and Vanguardia. The
                                Department is advising the Uruguayan Government of its views <pb
                                    n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0423"/>in the premises and is
                                suggesting that it proceed by sending its officers to the Forts in
                                question. The Department hopes that this last obstacle to prompt
                                initiation of direct negotiations will, therefore, soon be
                                removed.</p>

                            <p>18. Department’s telegram No. 16, March 5, 5 p.m. I spoke to the
                                President this morning in accordance with the Department’s
                                instructions. He expressed great pleasure at the message and stated
                                that he was sure direct negotiations in Washington were the most
                                practical means to reach a satisfactory solution and that he could
                                never have accepted another commission. He added that he was
                                prepared to start these negotiations as soon as the conciliation
                                agreement was fulfilled and that he would send Abelli to Washington
                                as Counselor of Legation with full powers to conduct them.</p>

                            <p>67. My Bolivian colleague has received a telegram from his Foreign
                                Office stating that the Government junta does not favor beginning
                                the boundary conversations in Washington till after the installation
                                of the civil government but that if the United States especially
                                desires that they begin without delay the point will be yielded. He
                                has so informed Zubizarreta.<note n="74" xml:id="d315fn74"

                                that Government to undertake conversations with Paraguayan
                                representative in Washington after the Conciliation Agreement of
                                September 12, 1929, has been complied with. The Conciliation
                                Agreement having now been fulfilled by the reestablishment of
                                diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Bolivia and the exchange
                                of forts, it would appear that the conversations may be entered into
                                at any time convenient to the two Governments concerned. So far as
                                this Government is concerned any time agreeable to Paraguay and
                                Bolivia will be satisfactory to it. This is a matter which could
                                perhaps best be discussed, in the first instance at least, directly
                                between the Paraguayan and Bolivian Governments.</p>

                            <p>47. The negotiations between Guatemala and Honduras have been carried
                                on now for somewhat over three months in a spirit of friendliness
                                but with little or no flexibility on the part of either
                                    delegation.<note n="76" xml:id="d318fn76">The conference was

                                have very categoric and rigid instructions. While very considerable
                                advance has been made, namely, tentative agreement on the line from
                                Cerro Brujo to Cerro Mirador, progress beyond that point has been
                                hampered by the unyielding position taken by both delegations under
                                instructions from their Governments.</p>
                            <p>While the Honduran delegation for some time maintained an
                                intransigent position in demanding the Rio Motagua from Rio Jubuco
                                to the sea it now seems possible that they would consent to a line
                                running from Cerro Mirador to Cerro Jubuco, to Cerro Morjá, to <pb
                                    n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0425"/>Plaza Playitas, to Plaza de
                                las Quebradas, to Quebrada Grande, and from there the Motagua to the
                                sea.</p>
                            <p>Should this line be acceptable to the Guatemalan Government it seems
                                likely that the question could be settled very shortly. The
                                Guatemalan delegation has rejected this line but has consented to
                                its being submitted to the Guatemalan Government. You will therefore
                                please take the matter up as soon as possible with the President,
                                setting forth the matter to him fully, as outlined above, and
                                inquire whether this line would be acceptable to the Guatemalan
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>[Paraphrase.] Should Guatemala definitely reject this line you will
                                then endeavor to have as much latitude as possible given to the
                                Guatemalan delegation to arrive at a solution. You understand that
                                while the Department would be glad should Guatemala accept this
                                line, as it would result in a settlement of the question, yet the
                                Department desires you carefully to avoid giving the impression that
                                this line is one proposed by the Government of the United States.
                                Confidentially it may be said that the Department rather expects
                                this line to be rejected, and then a Guatemalan line of the
                                Cordillera from Cerro Elencia to Cerro San Ildefonso and thence to
                                the Rio Tinto and the Motagua to be rejected by Honduras. With more
                                liberal instructions a definite line could be agreed upon somewhere
                                in between the two. Telegraph Department the result of your

                                and the Minister for Foreign Affairs; they reject definitely the

                            <p>24. Negotiations between Honduras and Guatemala have been carried on
                                now for somewhat over four months in a spirit of friendliness but
                                with little or no flexibility on the part of either delegation. Both
                                delegations apparently have very categoric and rigid instructions.
                                While very considerable advance has been made, namely, a tentative
                                agreement on the line from Cerro Brujo to Cerro Mirador, progress
                                beyond that point has been hampered by the unyielding position taken
                                by both delegations under instructions from their Governments.</p>
                            <p>While the Guatemalan delegation for sometime has maintained an
                                intransigent position in demanding the Merendon range from Cerro
                                Elencia to the sea, it now seems possible that if Honduras is
                                prepared to deal with the matter in a more liberal spirit, not
                                maintaining an intransigent position on the lines it has heretofore
                                taken, that Guatemala will consent to renounce its claim to a
                                portion of the right bank of the lower Motagua River.</p>
                            <p>The Honduran delegates state that they are bound by very rigid
                                instructions limited to listening informally to any proposals that
                                are made. They are thus prevented from entering into any serious
                                negotiations with a view to a settlement. The Department relied upon
                                the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Legation
                                as set forth in your telegrams 114, 117, and 118, of November 26, 10

                                as indicating that the Honduran delegates would have full powers to
                                negotiate a settlement of this question. The Department therefore
                                desires you to recall these statements very earnestly to the
                                attention of the Honduran Government and say that it feels that the
                                two Governments are now nearer a settlement than they have been in
                                the past and that if it will give more latitude to its delegation
                                not binding it to stand out for any particular line but authorizing
                                it to enter into a full and frank discussion with the Guatemalan
                                delegation and the Department it feels that a settlement can be
                                reached. In this connection, I may say that the Guatemalan
                                Government informed the American Minister in Guatemala that the
                                Guatemalan delegate <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0427"/>has
                                been given full powers. Please take this matter up actively with the
                                President and Minister for Foreign Affairs and cable the results.
                                Also cable any indication you may get as to concessions that
                                Honduras would be willing to make to arrive at a settlement.</p>
                            <p>You will of course point out that this Government has no interest in
                                the matter other than to help two friendly Governments arrive at a
                                just settlement of their difficulty and this Government has been
                                expending a great deal of time and effort for the last four months
                                in an endeavor to bring about a satisfactory settlement. If the
                                delegates of the two Governments, however, do not have ample
                                authority to negotiate a settlement this Government’s helpfulness in
                                the matter is limited and an agreement under such circumstances is
                                improbable.</p>
                            <p>[Paraphrase.] The following is strictly confidential. While the
                                Honduran delegation did suggest a line running from Cerro Mirador to
                                Cerro Jubuco, Cerro Morjá, Las Playitas, Las Quebradas, and thence
                                to the Motagua at Quebrada Grande, following the Motagua thence to
                                the sea, they have, nevertheless, very informally indicated in
                                conversation to members of the Department that they might be willing
                                to support a line from Cerro Morjá to the Cordillera and thence
                                along the northern slope to Cerro Chachagualia, leaving Jocornal and
                                Cerro Jocornal in Honduras and from Cerro Chachagualia to the Rio
                                Chachagualia, thence to the Motagua. However, if a settlement is to
                                be made, it will be necessary for Honduras to agree to a line
                                farther east than the Rio Chachagualia. This seems evident from the
                                situation developed in our conversations with the Guatemalan
                                delegation.</p>
                            <p>The Department desires that Minister Lay, immediately upon his
                                arrival in Tegucigalpa, follow up the representations of the Chargé
                                in the same manner indicated in this telegram and report the

                            <p>34. Your telegram No. 24, May 21, 6 p.m. The President has given me
                                to understand that while he would not concede the town of
                                Chachahualia he is willing that Honduran delegation submit to him a
                                proposed line east of the Rio Chachahualia and after consultation
                                with members of his Government and certain deputies he will advise
                                the delegation. The President insists that the Honduran delegation
                                has ample powers to do this without further instructions.</p>
                            <p>The President told me that to cede any of the territory east of the
                                Chachahualia River south of the Motagua River would be the greatest
                                sacrifice Honduras could make and would be very unpopular in
                                Honduras. He intimated that an exchange for other territory
                                southwest of Rio Chachahualia would be better than ceding any of
                                this area. He does not recognize that Guatemala has any legitimate
                                claim to the right bank of the lower Motagua River. [Paraphrase.]
                                The Foreign Minister, in the presence of the President, proposed
                                that the Department of State suggest a line to the delegates. The
                                President and the Foreign Minister undoubtedly believe that a line
                                suggested by the Department of State would stand a much better
                                chance of acceptance here than a line demanded or claimed by
                                Guatemala especially in the area where Hondurans feel they are
                                sacrificing their sovereignty. [End paraphrase.]<note n="79"

                            <p>46. The President of the Republic, in the presence of the Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs, requested me to telegraph you his appreciation
                                for your suggestion to the delegates in Washington that the Arbitral
                                Commission be composed of one delegate proposed by Honduras, one by

                            <p>29. Your 46, June 17, 5 p.m. The suggestion was not made by the
                                Department that the Arbitral Commission be composed of one delegate
                                proposed by Honduras, one by Guatemala, and presided over by the
                                Chief Justice of the United States. The Department’s representative
                                at the meeting of the Commission first asked the Honduran delegates
                                who would be acceptable as Arbitrator and they listed the President
                                of the United States, the Chief Justice, or one of the American
                                Judges on The Hague Tribunal. Guatemala insisted upon the Central
                                American Tribunal as the Treaty of 1923<note n="80"
                                    xml:id="d324fn80">Convention for the establishment of an

                                    296.</note> is binding on both Guatemala and Honduras. Honduras
                                was not favorable to the Central American Tribunal. Inquiry was then
                                made whether that Tribunal would be acceptable if agreement was had
                                in advance as to who would preside over it. The Guatemalan delegate
                                said that the Chief Justice of the United States would be eminently
                                satisfactory to Guatemala as the third and presiding member. The
                                Honduran delegation immediately accepted this proposal but stated it
                                desired to have a Tribunal of three, one appointed by Guatemala, one
                                by Honduras, to be presided over by the Chief Justice. The
                                Guatemalan delegation insists that as the Treaty of 1923 is in
                                effect and binding between the two countries that Tribunal should be
                                accepted with the agreement made in advance, if necessary, as to the
                                members who will compose the Tribunal. Honduras, while admitting
                                that the Convention is in effect, maintains that it does not apply
                                to this one particular case because Article I excepts cases in which
                                the parties have “accepted some other form of arbitration”. The
                                Honduran position is that the Treaty of 1914<note n="81"
                                    xml:id="d324fn81">See <ref target="frus1917#pg_786"><hi

                                1923 and constituted acceptance of some other form of arbitration.
                                The Honduran delegation maintains that the Treaty of 1914 was in
                                effect at the time of the Central American Conference <pb n="350"
                                    xml:id="pg_350" facs="0430"/>in 1923 and that as the Convention
                                signed at that time might not be ratified for some months, Mr.
                                Hughes’ suggestion that the boundary matter be settled in accordance
                                with the 1914 Convention was perfectly proper and acceptable to
                                Guatemala. As you know, the Governments did not agree, however, on
                                the formula for arbitration and no action was taken under the 1914
                                Treaty before it expired by limitation in 1925. That Treaty being
                                now of no effect, Guatemala maintains that it can not be alleged
                                that they have accepted some other form of arbitration and hence can
                                not submit their boundary dispute to the Central American Tribunal.
                                The Department considers that this view is correct and if you can
                                persuade the Honduran Government to accept the Central American
                                Tribunal, with an agreement that the Chief Justice of the United
                                States be asked to preside at its deliberations, it will make an
                                agreement very much easier.</p>
                            <p>The difference between the two delegations is one of form; both are
                                agreed upon the composition of the Tribunal and it is merely this
                                technicality as to whether they have accepted some other form of
                                arbitration or not which is delaying an agreement. This technicality
                                could in any event be waived by the Honduran Government, even should
                                its position be correct, and the Department very much hopes it will
                                do so in the interest of a prompt agreement.</p>

                            <p>51. I have just received a note from the President of the Republic,
                                dated June 23, stating that he has received a telegram from the
                                Honduranean delegation in Washington to the effect that the
                                Department’s proposal that the competency of the Central American
                                Tribunal to try the boundary question be submitted to a special
                                tribunal has been, accepted with the understanding that both parties
                                will abide by the decision of the special tribunal.</p>
                            <p>The President’s note then adds that although the Honduranean
                                delegates have ample powers to act as they think best he has
                                recommended that they observe the greatest harmony with the
                                impartial opinion of the Department of State “principally with
                                reference to the acceptance of the special treaty of juridical
                                arbitration”.</p>
                            <p>In view of the above message from the Honduranean delegation he
                                states that he has decided not to call for the present the meeting
                                mentioned in my telegram No. 49, June 22, 7 p.m.<note n="82"

                            <p>151. Please communicate following as soon as possible to the
                                Honorable Charles E. Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, who
                                is now motoring in northern France, Belgium or the Rhineland, and
                                whose address is care of Bankers’ Trust Company, 5 Place Vendome,
                                Paris: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“After six months negotiations in an endeavor to settle the
                                        boundary dispute between Guatemala and Honduras, a direct
                                        settlement not having been possible, the Delegates of the
                                        two countries have agreed on an arbitration treaty.</p>
                                    <p>There is a difference between them as to whether the
                                        International Central American Tribunal established at the
                                        Conference on Central American Affairs, February 7th, 1923,
                                        has jurisdiction or not, but they have agreed to submit this
                                        question of competency to a Special Tribunal to be composed
                                        in the same manner as the International Central American
                                        Tribunal, provided that the Chief Justice of the United
                                        States is the third and presiding member. This Special
                                        Tribunal will determine the competency of the Central
                                        American Tribunal. If the Special Tribunal decides that the
                                        Central American Tribunal has jurisdiction, it will
                                        immediately constitute itself as the Central American
                                        Tribunal to determine the question at issue between them. If
                                        it decides that the Central American Tribunal has not
                                        jurisdiction, then the Special Tribunal will proceed to a
                                        consideration of the boundary dispute. It is provided that
                                        the Special Tribunal will meet, if it is possible, within
                                        sixty days following the exchange of ratifications of the
                                        Convention which they hope to sign on or about the fifteenth
                                        of this month. Provision is made that while the Parties are
                                        bound by the dates fixed the Tribunal can change them in
                                        order to meet with your convenience if you will accept to
                                        act as Presiding Judge. In other words, should the sixty
                                        days fall within your holiday next year, the court would not
                                        meet until the date fixed by you at your convenience in the
                                        following autumn.</p>
                                    <p>I have been requested by both Parties to communicate with you
                                        and inquire whether you will permit them to provide in the
                                        treaty that the Chief Justice of the United States shall be
                                        the third arbitrator who will preside over the Tribunal.</p>
                                    <p>I may say that there was very considerable difficulty in
                                        bringing them to an agreement on the Tribunal in view of
                                        their difference of opinion as to whether or not the Central
                                        American Tribunal is competent. Guatemala insisted upon the
                                        competency of the Central American Tribunal whereas Honduras
                                        desired the arbitration to be before a Special Tribunal
                                        presided over by you. Guatemala stated that it would accept
                                        the compromise arrangement of arbitrating the competency of
                                        the Central American Tribunal on the condition that the
                                        third arbitrator should be the Chief Justice of the United
                                        States. This was readily accepted by Honduras. After six
                                        months of negotiations it was the first point on which they
                                        were able to agree.</p>
                                    <p>May I ask you to be so good as to transmit your reply to me
                                        through any of our diplomatic or consular officers who will

                                        Honduras, Signed at Washington, July 16, 1930</hi></head>
                                <p>The Governments of the Republics of Guatemala and Honduras, being
                                    desirous of settling the question of territorial boundaries
                                    which is unfortunately pending between the two Republics, have
                                    agreed to submit the said question to arbitration through the
                                    conclusion of this treaty, for which purpose they have appointed
                                    the following as their respective plenipotentiaries, to wit:</p>
                                <p>the Government of Guatemala: <list>
                                        <item>Licenciado Don Carlos Salazar and Licenciado Don
                                            Eugenio Silva Peña,</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <p>and the Government of Honduras: <list>
                                        <item>Dr. Mariano Vasquez,</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0433"/>
                                <p>who, having examined their respective Full Powers, which they
                                    found to be in good and due form,</p>
                                <p>Have agreed upon the following articles:</p>
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article I</hi></p>
                                <p>The High Contracting Parties agree that the Convention for the
                                    Establishment of an International Central American Tribunal,
                                    signed at Washington February 7, 1923, is in effect between
                                    them, in accordance with Article XXVI of the same Convention.
                                    The Government of Guatemala makes this declaration without
                                    reservations. The Government of Honduras affirms that that
                                    Convention is obligatory as to all controversies with the
                                    exception of the boundary dispute between Guatemala and
                                    Honduras, taking as a basis the wording of Article I of the said
                                    Convention, which does not include questions with regard to
                                    which the parties shall have “accepted some other form of
                                    arbitration”. The Government of Honduras believes that this
                                    provision excludes from the jurisdiction of the International
                                    Central American Tribunal its boundary question pending with
                                    Guatemala, by virtue of the fact that the Convention for the
                                    Establishment of an International Central American Tribunal was
                                    signed February 7, 1923, while the Boundary Convention signed
                                    August 1, 1914, was in effect between the two countries.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Guatemala maintains that the International
                                    Central American Tribunal is fully competent to pass judgment,
                                    in judicial arbitration proceedings, on the pending boundary
                                    question, because its jurisdiction extends, in accordance with
                                    Article I of the respective Convention, invoked by the
                                    Government of Honduras, to “all controversies or questions which
                                    now exist between them or which may hereafter arise, whatever
                                    their nature or origin”, a wording which covers and includes
                                    every question of territorial limits, without the competence of
                                    the tribunal being affected by the reservation alleged by the
                                    Government of Honduras, because there is no agreement between
                                    the parties, as to any other form of arbitration, since the
                                    willingness manifested in 1923 to submit the question to the
                                    President of the United States of America lapsed with the treaty
                                    of 1914 on which it was based.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Guatemala believes that the divergence existing
                                    between the points of view of the two governments, with respect
                                    to the application of the Convention for the Establishment of an
                                    International Central American Tribunal, can and must be
                                    adjusted in conformity with Article XIII of the said pact.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Honduras is of the opinion that the
                                    International <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0434"/>Central
                                    American Tribunal is not authorized to determine its original
                                    competence, but only to decide the incidental competence, with
                                    the restrictions of Article I of the said Convention.</p>
                                <p>Both parties, however, agree that the tribunal which takes
                                    cognizance of the boundary question between the two countries,
                                    shall be organized in the same form prescribed in the Convention
                                    for the Establishment of an International Central American
                                    Tribunal.</p>
                                <p>In order to settle the conflict between the opposing points of
                                    view of the two governments, they have decided to establish in
                                    the city of Washington, a Special Tribunal, constituted in the
                                    form prescribed by the Convention for the Establishment of an
                                    International Central American Tribunal and to submit to this
                                    Special Tribunal in the first place, the following question:
                                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>Is the International Central American Tribunal created by

                                            cognizance of the boundary question pending between
                                            Guatemala and Honduras?</p>

                                <p>If the decision of the Special Tribunal denies the competence of

                                    of the pending boundary question, the same tribunal, as Special
                                    Boundary Tribunal, shall proceed to take cognizance of the

                                    International Central American Tribunal, of the boundary
                                    question pending between Guatemala and Honduras and will sit at

                                <p>In both cases, the stipulations of the present Treaty shall be

                                    of 1821. Consequently, they are in accord that the Tribunal
                                    shall determine this line. If the Tribunal finds that one or
                                    both parties, in their subsequent development have established,
                                    beyond that line, interests which should be taken into account
                                    in establishing the definitive boundary, the Tribunal shall

                                boundary. The procedure apparently contemplated by the two
                                Governments embraces the signing <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362"

                                action would be agreeable to the two Governments concerned, to lend
                                its further cooperation by authorizing the American representatives
                                at Tegucigalpa and Managua to collaborate in the preparation of the

                            <p>A similar instruction is being addressed to the American Minister at

                                he will inform you of that fact and inquire whether the situation at
                                Tegucigalpa likewise is propitious for the initiation of similar
                                negotiations. When your respective Legations are in agreement as to
                                the advisability of opening negotiations and the date upon which
                                they shall be initiated and it has been ascertained by informal

                                King of Spain, and that its decisions and demarcation of the line

                                        361</ref>.</note> concerning the reopening of negotiations,
                                the Nicaragua-Honduras boundary matter. When I called upon President
                                Moncada yesterday to keep him informed of developments in connection
                                with recent incidents on the border which have provoked protest from
                                the Government of Honduras, I asked him what would be the effect on
                                the existing situation if negotiations in the boundary dispute
                                should be reopened. He replied that he is convinced that the
                                creation of a boundary commission as heretofore proposed is the best
                                if not the only way by which a permanent solution of the difficulty
                                along the frontier including the suppression of banditry can be
                                attained. He said he has been of this opinion all along and that he
                                is more convinced than ever that negotiations should be reopened as
                                soon as possible. He said I might so inform you if I cared to do so
                                and that he is prepared to carry out his part of whatever program
                                may be decided upon.</p>
                            <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0444"/>
                            <p>I was guarded in my comment on his views and told him it was a matter
                                I wanted to consider maturely. I am, however, in full accord with
                                his views and think there should be no delay in reopening
                                negotiations if the Government of Honduras sees the matter in the
                                same light. I believe that if a commission is created and sent to
                                the border both Governments will be under obligations to afford it
                                protection and that military cooperation between the forces of the
                                two countries will thus be automatically insured. I am convinced
                                that the Government will reply in a friendly and conciliatory tone
                                to the recent protests of the Government of Honduras and it seems
                                probable that the friendly atmosphere which should exist if
                                negotiations are reopened can be created.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the recent incidents involving charges that
                                the <hi rend="italic">guardia</hi> has entered Honduranean territory
                                occurred along the portion of the frontier not embraced in the award
                                of the King of Spain, it may be desirable in the course of the
                                prospective negotiations to discuss broadening the terms of the
                                protocol and the duties of the commission to include re-marking the
                                boundary to the west of the Pass of Teotecacinte. Moreover, if this
                                is not done, a new controversy is liable to arise in the future with
                                respect to this portion of the boundary.</p>
                            <p>I am repeating this to Tegucigalpa and will await the Department’s
                                further instructions.</p>

                            <p>111. Referring to the Department’s instruction No. 1, May 21, and
                                telegram from American Legation, Managua, to the Department June 13,
                                4 p.m. President Mejia Colindres told me this morning that he would
                                be pleased if negotiations in the boundary dispute were reopened and
                                a boundary commission created as soon as possible. He said that the
                                fixing of the boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua promptly in
                                this way would accomplish much to avoid the disputes along the
                                frontier and thereby create a better understanding between the two
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>I am awaiting instructions from the Department and further advices
                                from American Legation at Managua before taking further steps
                                mentioned in Department’s instruction.</p>

                            <p>71. My telegram No. 70, June 13, 4 p.m. The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs told me this afternoon that President Moncada had instructed
                                him to draft a protocol to submit the boundary dispute to a
                                commission. I fear that this will complicate matters and hope that

                            <p>74. Department’s telegram 54, June 19, 7 p.m. President Moncada told
                                me this morning that in his opinion the draft protocol of agreement
                                will be more favorably received by the Government of Honduras if
                                prepared by the Department of State than if prepared by the
                                Government of Nicaragua and that he will welcome the Department’s

                            <p>34. Legation’s 58, July 7, 5 p.m. The selection of the place at which
                                the boundary protocol is to be signed is a matter for agreement
                                between the Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua. Should you find
                                that they are unable to reach an agreement on this point, however,
                                perhaps the difficulty might be solved by signature in Washington.
                                The Department of course, prefers that the protocol be signed either
                                in Honduras or Nicaragua.</p>

                                I expect to receive soon this Government’s reply concerning the
                                draft protocol. The Minister for <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368"
                                    facs="0448"/>Foreign Affairs has just told me that his
                                Government probably will propose the addition of a provision to the
                                effect that the Government of Honduras will guarantee property
                                rights legally acquired by Nicaraguans and others under Nicaraguan
                                law in territory heretofore considered as Nicaraguan but which the
                                Boundary Commission may decide to be Honduranean territory, and that
                                the Government of Nicaragua will give a similar guarantee under
                                similar conditions. He said that this would be the only material
                                change in the draft protocol that his Government will suggest.</p>

                                American Legation in Tegucigalpa. President Moncada does not agree
                                to signing the protocol in Tegucigalpa because in his opinion it
                                would create an unfavorable impression here. He thinks that his
                                Government will be in a much <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0451"
                                />stronger position if the protocol is signed in Managua and has
                                asked me to make this known to the Department and the Government of
                                Honduras. He appears to think that the Government of Honduras should
                                not insist on this point but if it does he will consider signing in
                                neutral territory or in both Tegucigalpa and Managua if this is
                                admissible. I believe this small concession on the part of Honduras
                                to sentiment here might have a beneficial effect now and when the
                                protocol is before the Nicaraguan Congress, and I hope we may induce
                                the Government of Honduras to concede this point. I will postpone
                                suggesting signature in Washington until I am advised as to the
                                decision of the Government of Honduras. If the protocol is signed in
                                the near future it probably will be submitted to an extra session of
                                the Nicaraguan Congress.</p>

                            <p>115. Department’s telegram 86, August 20, 3 p.m. The following
                                telegram has just been sent to the American Legation at Tegucigalpa:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“September 16, 2 p.m. The full text of the boundary protocol
                                        as proposed by the Government of Honduras and transmitted
                                        with your air mail letter of August 17th is accepted by the
                                        Government of Nicaragua with the omission of article 5 which
                                        this Government deems unessential to the execution of the
                                        protocol.</p>
                                    <p>Confidential for your information and discreet use: The
                                        Minister for Foreign Affairs has told me informally that
                                        this Government thinks that article 5 indicates doubt on the
                                        part of the Government of Honduras of the good faith of the
                                        Government of Nicaragua and he said that consequently the
                                        article is not acceptable.</p>
                                    <p>Article 5 would certainly arouse bitter opposition in the
                                        Nicaraguan <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0453"/>Congress
                                        and might defeat ratification of protocol. I have suggested
                                        no substitute for article 5 because the point covered by it
                                        seems unimportant, as compliance with the provision of law
                                        will be a matter of good faith on the part of both
                                        Governments.</p>
                                    <p>The Department’s telegram July 8, 6 p.m., to your Legation
                                        and my telegram to the Department July 31, 6 p.m., repeated
                                        to you concerning place at which the protocol is to be
                                        signed: I anticipate opposition to the protocol which may
                                        seriously endanger its ratification. The impression here
                                        will be much more favorable if the protocol is signed in
                                        Managua than it would be if signed in Tegucigalpa or
                                        [Washington?]. Signing in Tegucigalpa probably would greatly
                                        strengthen the opposition.”</p>

                            <p>157. Department’s 127, November 8, 5 p.m.<note n="98a"
                                    xml:id="d352fn98a">Not printed.</note> The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs told me late yesterday that President Moncada desires to
                                have some definite assurance of effective cooperation by the
                                Government of Honduras in the suppression of banditry before signing
                                the boundary protocol and had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                to discuss the matter with me in an effort to find some acceptable
                                way to attain that desire. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said
                                that President Moncada thinks this a favorable opportunity to ask
                                for such assurance which if given would help to meet opposition of
                                the Conservative Party which has consistently opposed the Award of
                                the King of Spain for a long period of years as well as the
                                opposition of many Liberals who think Nicaragua is conceding too
                                much and Honduras nothing. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stoutly
                                maintained that his Government is not trying to evade signing the
                                protocol and would sign as soon as the assurance mentioned was
                                granted.</p>
                            <p>I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that while I appreciated
                                President Moncada’s desire I would not like to submit to either my
                                Government or the Government of Honduras a proposal to attain the
                                desired assurance if acceptance thereof would be a condition
                                precedent to signing the protocol. I told him a proposal made in
                                such fashion could certainly be misinterpreted and would place this
                                Government in an equivocal position in spite of protestations that
                                it is not trying to evade signing the protocol. He said he thought
                                President Moncada would insist upon having the assurance and I told
                                him that I believe he could count upon the Department’s assistance
                                if the matter is presented to the Government of Honduras in an
                                appropriate manner and at the proper time, but that I did not
                                believe my Government would care to give its cooperation if this
                                Government should now attach some condition to signing the protocol
                                or even delay signing pending consideration of this new point. <pb
                                    n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0455"/>I pointed out that the
                                presence of the Boundary Commission on the frontier would place upon
                                the Government of Honduras an equal share of responsibility for the
                                adequate protection of the Commission and thus automatically bring
                                about the desired cooperation and I reminded him that President
                                Moncada had told me some months ago that he viewed the matter in
                                that sense. I also pointed out that the probability of getting the
                                desired assurance would be improved by signing the protocol. The
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs said he would present my views to
                                President Moncada and advise me further.</p>
                            <p>I deem President Moncada’s desire reasonable if properly presented.
                                The Boundary Commission must be given protection and the presence of
                                an American on the Commission would appear to justify our arranging
                                for Honduras to give an appropriate share of such protection but
                                there should be no delay in signing the protocol pending that
                                arrangement. The political difficulties mentioned by President
                                Moncada exist and merit consideration. I may have some success in
                                minimizing opposition by the Conservative Party but that party is
                                now seeking issues on which to attack the Liberal administration.
                                Please instruct.</p>

                                that the President of Honduras had just increased Honduran forces on
                                the border from 30 to 70 men. The Minister stated that “vigorous
                                pursuit of bandits in Honduras can be expected.”</p>

                                to confer with President Moncada and informally state that the
                                Department regrets, in view of the antecedents in the case, that any
                                suggestion of further delay in the signing of the Nicaragua-Honduras
                                boundary protocol should arise, and the Department sincerely hopes
                                that he may see his way clear to have the protocol as already agreed
                                upon signed in Managua at an early date.</p>
                            <p>The Department feels that the recent actions of the Government of

                                22, 11 a.m., indicate the favorable attitude of that Government.</p>
                            <p>[Paraphrase.] The following is confidential. The Department
                                appreciates the political difficulties which face the President and
                                it hopes that you may be successful in minimizing opposition by
                                Conservative leaders. The Department further hopes that the
                                President himself will be able to avert opposition within his own
                                party. [End paraphrase.]</p>
                            <p>Your actions as outlined in the second paragraph of your telegram are
                                approved and you should continue negotiations along the same

                                Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning concerning other matters,
                                he told me he had conferred with President Moncada as promised in
                                his previous conversation with me (reported upon in my telegram No.
                                163, November 29, 1 p.m.) and that President Moncada had authorized

                                protocol in Managua at the end of this month and that the Department
                                may so inform the Government of Honduras to the end that the

                                    xml:id="pg_377" facs="0457"/>and have him proceed to Managua
                                with powers to sign the protocol. I told the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs I would advise you immediately by cable of the President’s
                                decision in this matter and he concurred.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he personally thinks that
                                publicity in this matter should be delayed as long as possible and
                                that in his opinion this Government will maintain secrecy in this
                                matter until the protocol is actually signed unless it is forced to
                                make some statement to meet reports originating here or elsewhere
                                concerning the negotiations. He said he thought it desirable to make

                                protocol is signed. I told him I would so advise you. President
                                Moncada is absent from Managua and is not expected to return until
                                December 8, his birthday. I will confer with him at the earliest
                                practical moment thereafter; but, in view of the foregoing, I assume
                                the Department will wish me to modify appropriately the instruction
                                given in its telegram 135, December 5, 5 p.m.</p>
                            <p>I will repeat this telegram to Tegucigalpa, but I assume the
                                Department will give the American Legation there appropriate
                                instruction in the matter. With reference to the Department’s No.
                                84, December 5, 6 p.m., to Tegucigalpa,<note n="1" xml:id="d356fn1"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            cumulative results of hard times and the partial paralysis of the normal
                            functions of government are stimulating the feeling that before many
                            months elapse a change will come about.</p>
                        <p>The peso continues to depreciate daily as compared with foreign
                            currencies. In the face of this phenomenon one possibility mentioned is
                            to print more paper money, which would make the situation far worse. The
                            other is to resort to a foreign loan. But the administration continues
                            to delay and the terms of the financiers presumably grow stiffer as
                            conditions get worse.… Labor is in an exceptionally refractory
                            temper.</p>
                        <p>Any administration would be in a serious predicament in the face of such
                            conditions. The present regime is held to be exceptionally dictatorial
                            and extraordinarily inactive. The opposition within the Government party
                            is growing.</p>
                        <p>Rumors are consequently current that the President may soon resign. If he
                            did so his natural successor would be the Vice-President who is reported
                            to be a good man. The latter, however, owes his selection to and is
                            identified closely with the Minister of the Interior, who is considered
                            the leader of one faction of the Radical Party, even as the Oyhanartes
                            are prominent in the other wing, which represents the younger element;
                            hence there is a rumor that both President and Vice-President might
                            resign and that Congress would elect Dr. Alcorta, a former President of
                            the Republic and a member of the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>While I do not at the moment of writing take much stock in reports of
                            presidential or vice-presidential resignations, it is the general
                            opinion that conditions are exceptionally bad and that the President’s
                            age, mentality and the state of his health render his continuation in
                            office, if not problematical, at any rate a serious problem.</p>

                            may have been used by party chiefs in an endeavor to influence the
                            President to believe that his life is in danger, that his only safeguard
                            is to resign. The reinforcement of the guards at the Government House
                            and President’s residence in the last three days may have been done for
                            the same purpose, though it is alleged to be the results of the
                            discovery of plots against the Government. Nervousness has noticeably
                            increased among officials and public. It is said that the military and
                            naval forces favor the elimination of the provisions as to his
                            successor. According to a fairly reliable report which came to me today,
                            the President has consented to resign within the next few days. The
                            situation is very tense but nothing definite has appeared.</p>

                            enthusiasm. At about 5 p.m. the white flag was hoisted at Government
                            House and about an hour later General <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380"

                            civilians was triumphantly brought there by the populace, the Vice
                            President at once signing his resignation as Acting President. The
                            Cabinet officers who had already deserted their posts are at
                            liberty.</p>
                        <p>Asylum had been asked for Irigoyen of the Chilean Ambassador and was
                            accorded though not availed of, Irigoyen fleeing to La Plata where he
                            surrendered himself to the military and resigned. He has not been held
                            under restraint and is as free as his enfeebled physical condition
                            permits.</p>

                            cases of vandalism have been reported. This is a credit to the Argentine
                            populace as well as to military discipline and Uriburu is much gratified
                            at having consummated his coup without serious bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after assuming control the military junta issued a warning
                            against excesses, dissolved Congress, and in Government proclamation
                            stating that the Provisional Government would remain in power only until
                            elections could be held, Government members pledging [<hi rend="italic"
                                >pledged?</hi>] themselves neither to present nor accept their
                            candidacy to the Presidency of the nation. The Uruguayan Ambassador
                            tells me that he called informally this morning on Uriburu who said one
                            of his principal concerns was how foreign countries would envisage his
                            act and the attitude they would assume toward the new Government, for
                            which reason he had selected Bosch as Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            feeling sure a man of his high standing would produce a favorable effect
                            abroad. [Paraphrase.] At the request of Bosch, who desires to talk with
                            me before receiving the other foreign representatives, I am meeting him
                            tomorrow morning at the residence of Adolfo Bioy, the new Under
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs. I shall then make the suggestion, as my
                            personal opinion, that, in the official notification to the Chiefs of
                            Missions of the establishment of a Provisional Government, he should not
                            include a request for recognition. Recognition by the Government of the
                            United States, however, would give not only great satisfaction to the
                            new Government and its many adherents but would also help our situation
                            in Argentina. I believe that the Provisional Government will be able to
                            maintain itself in power until it has realized its declared purpose of
                            holding, at the earliest possible date, elections for national Senators
                            and Deputies and for President and Vice President. The preparation of
                            the necessary machinery toward this <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"
                                facs="0461"/>end in the capital and provinces will require a
                            considerable time. The Provisional Government is comprised of honest
                            patriots, the Minister of the Interior and head of Cabinet being
                            especially competent. All of them are Conservatives and represent the
                            political minority of recent years. Nevertheless, the venality and
                            blatant abuses of the Irigoyen Government have aroused such widespread
                            indignation that it has been possible for Conservatives to overthrow it
                            with the genuine approval of the majority of the population.</p>
                        <p>While following closely the developments of the next few days I recommend
                            that the Government of the United States be ready to recognize this
                            Provisional Government at an early date, and as soon as, if not before,
                            any other important power. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>125.… This morning there was published a declaration of the Independent
                            Socialists giving their approval and adherence to the Provisional
                            Government. Additional indications show that the overthrow of President
                            Hipólito Irigoyen is warmly accepted throughout the country, and my
                            belief that the new Government will be able to maintain itself and hold
                            fair elections is being strengthened constantly by the news received
                            from all parts of the country.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning of September 6 a delegation of minority members of
                            Congress [went to?] Campo de Mayo urging General Uriburu and exhorting
                            troops to overthrow the Government. I again desire to emphasize the
                            civilian composition of the new Government and that the Irigoyen
                            Government was overthrown by a popular outburst of indignation and to
                            renew the recommendation I made previously that the Government of the
                            United States consider an early recognition believing that it would
                            contribute toward the creation of a pleasant feeling on the part of the
                            general public toward the United States.</p>

                            was fully considered by President Hoover. There appears to be no
                            possibility of immediate recognition. I may say in the strictest
                            confidence that a proposal has been made that the United States and
                            Great Britain discuss the matter of recognition with each other. The

                        <p>129. The Department is already aware of the fact that the revolution has
                            resulted in favorable advance of exchange and an offer of a <pb n="383"
                                xml:id="pg_383" facs="0463"/>loan double the amount asked by the
                            Provisional Government; there are, however, other indications of
                            immediate return of confidence; i. e., trade is resuming liabilities
                            eliminated during the past years, commercial houses are making
                            contributions to organizations previously refused in 1930, and in all
                            probability the Supreme Court will manifest its adhesion to the
                            Provisional Government within a few days.</p>
                        <p>The report of the embarkation of Irigoyen on an Argentine warship today
                            is correct.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon the Spanish Ambassador called to inform me that he had
                            received authorization to recognize the Provisional Government; that
                            both he and the Italian Ambassador were desirous of proceeding at once
                            but were disposed to wait if there were any likelihood of the United
                            States taking similar action. I have learned confidentially that Uruguay
                            is also ready to extend recognition. Yesterday the British Ambassador
                            called to inquire about our attitude toward recognition, and I learned
                            that he too had recommended it to his Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Department’s 100, September 11, 1 p.m., it would
                            aid me to know whether the suggestion of American-British cooperation in
                            matters of recognition originated with the British. It appears to me
                            that England as the traditional friend of Argentina gains by keeping the
                            United States from obtaining marked advantage in being first to extend
                            recognition while her own nonrecognition loses her nothing as long as
                            the United States is also withholding recognition. On the other hand, by
                            simultaneous recognition the United States loses an advantage which
                            becomes a British gain.</p>
                        <p>The United States, as the most feared and envied nation, has an
                            opportunity to assist Argentina at a moment when moral support would be

                            here. American business interests desire recognition in order to hasten
                            recuperative business.</p>

                        <p>132. Your 101, September 13, 3 p.m. Immediately after the overthrow of
                            the Irigoyen Government the military authorities took charge of all
                            provincial governments, civilian interventors having since been named
                            for seven, military for two, naval for one and remaining two
                            unannounced. In the two other provinces, Entre Rios and San Luis, the
                            normal government machinery is functioning, anti-inte [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>] Irigoyenists having triumphed in recent elections.</p>
                        <p>The interventors appointed are men of highest type and are qualified to
                            dominate the situation, such as Carlos Ibarguren for Cordoba, <pb
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0465"/>Diego Saavedra for Santa Fe,
                            Marco Aurelio Avellaneda for San Juan and Carlos Meyer Pellegrini, the
                            last named having already assumed control of Buenos Aires Province with
                            marked public approval. All the others will take office this week.</p>
                        <p>The Socialist Party has declared that while registering the illegality of
                            the Provisional Government it acknowledges it and expresses faith in its
                            intentions though, it will not collaborate with it. The Independent
                            Socialist Party has made a like but more explicitly favorable
                            declaration. The leaders of both parties have conferred with the
                            Government and expressed confidence in the new Government. A majority of
                            the members of the Senate, including all parties except the Radical, and
                            the Deputies of all parties except the Radical met separately and
                            declared in favor of dissolution. All parties in the Capital and the
                            provinces except the Radical approve and support the Provisional
                            Government. The overthrow of Irigoyen may justly be described as
                            restoration rather than revolution. It is unquestionably civilian or
                            popular rather than military, a constitutionalist movement
                            unconstitutionally born.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called at my house yesterday morning to say that
                            his Government appreciated our friendly attitude in taking up with him
                            the question of recognition of the new government of Argentina. He had
                            just received a telegram, in which he was instructed to say that the
                            British had studied the question very seriously in the light of reports
                            from South America and had decided that clearly the governments of both
                            Peru and Argentina should be recognized at the same time. The Foreign
                            Office feels that conditions in the two countries are very similar and
                            that it would be invidious to recognize one without recognizing the
                            other. The Foreign Office feels, furthermore, that these governments,
                            having displayed a reasonable stability and having expressed the
                            determination to protect foreigners and to fulfill international
                            relations, that they should be promptly recognized. The British
                            Government wants us to know that Great Britain will recognize both Peru
                            and the Argentine next Wednesday.<note n="3" xml:id="d370fn3">September
                                17.</note> He hopes that this will be agreeable to us and that we
                            shall be willing to recognize at the same time. The Ambassador tells me
                            that, in the meantime, if the question is raised, their <pb n="386"
                                xml:id="pg_386" facs="0466"/>Ambassadors have been told to say that,
                            although there has not yet been formal recognition, they have been
                            authorized to carry on diplomatically exactly as in the past.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the telegrams we have received, it seems to me we should
                            be exceedingly unwise not to do this. I told the Ambassador that I would
                            telephone him some time this morning what we should do.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State stated:<note n="5" xml:id="d375fn5">The statement
                                was transmitted to the American diplomatic missions in Costa Rica,
                                Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras,
                                Nicaragua, and Panama in circular telegram of September 17, 4 p.m.
                                The first four paragraphs of the statement were transmitted to the
                                American diplomatic missions in Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru in
                                another circular telegram of September 17, 4 p.m.</note></p>
                        <p>“I have directed Mr. Bliss, our Ambassador to Argentina, to resume normal
                            diplomatic relations with the provisional Argentine Government; and have
                            directed Mr. Dearing, our Ambassador to Peru, to resume normal
                            diplomatic relations with the provisional Peruvian Government; and have
                            directed Mr. Feely, our Minister accredited to Bolivia, to present his
                            letters of credence and resume normal diplomatic relations with the
                            provisional Bolivian Government. This is to be done tomorrow, September
                            eighteenth.</p>
                        <p>“In reaching the conclusion to accord recognition to these three
                            governments, the evidence has satisfied me that these provisional
                            governments are <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> in control of their
                            respective countries, and that there is no active resistance to their
                            rule. Each of the present governments has also made it clear that it is
                            its intention to fulfill its respective international obligations and to
                            hold, in due course, elections to regularize its status.</p>
                        <p>“The action of the United States in thus recognizing the present
                            Argentine, Peruvian and Bolivian Governments does not represent <pb
                                n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0468"/>any new policy or change of
                            policy by the United States toward the nations of South America or the
                            rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>“I have deemed it wise to act promptly in this matter in order that in
                            the present economic situation our delay may not embarrass the people of
                            these friendly countries in reestablishing their normal inter-course
                            with the rest of the world.”</p>
                        <p>(The Secretary was asked to clarify his statement that this does not
                            represent any change in policy. In reply he stated:)</p>
                        <p>“In acting towards these three Governments, which we are recognizing
                            tomorrow, we are following the regular rules of international Jaw, and
                            the regular policy which has characterized this country ever since the
                            first Secretary of State announced it—Mr. Jefferson in the
                            Administration of President Washington. But with certain countries there
                            are differences made by treaty either with us or between each other. For
                            example, the five Central American countries have entered into a treaty
                            between themselves in which they agreed not to recognize any Government
                            which came into office by virtue of a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>
                            or a revolution. That was done in 1923,<note n="6" xml:id="d375fn6"
                                >General treaty of peace and amity signed at Washington, February 7,

                                Printing Office, 1923), pp. 287, 288.</note> and although we were
                            not a party to the treaty, we were in hearty accord with it and we
                            agreed on our part that we would follow the same policy with respect to
                            the five Republics who had agreed upon it.</p>
                        <p>“I think in order that you may get this clear I will give you a statement
                            Mr. Hughes made in June, 1923, and which represents the present policy
                            of this Government. Mr. Hughes stated the attitude of our Government in
                            regard to these five Central American Governments as follows:</p>

                                the most hearty accord, will be consonant with the provisions of
                                Article II thereof which stipulates that the contracting parties

                            entered into by treaty between themselves with the object evidently of

                            the five Republics, and we endorsed that policy so far as those five

                            States in this and in all other matters and that … he would nevertheless
                            recognize all three governments at the same time as did the Government
                            of the United States.</p>

                            Commission to act in the matter, such action had better be taken at the
                            next meeting which will be held towards the end of this month and which
                            will perhaps be the last meeting at which the Commission would still

                            objections and that the Italian representative said he personally was in

                            objections since recent difficulties between Italy and Austria had now
                            been arranged, but that he would consult with his Government to confirm

                        <p>It is possible that some delegation may insist on adding to the foregoing
                            the phrase appearing at the end of the penultimate paragraph of the text
                            of the original relief bond of 1920, beginning “without prejudice to the
                            obligations of Austria” and ending “by an interested power”. If this
                            should be insisted on, I assume there could be no objection from our
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>I therefore respectfully request early instructions by telegraph as to
                            (1) whether the Department desires the Commission to act in the matter,
                            and (2), if so, whether the suggested draft decision is satisfactory.
                            The foregoing is of course all subject to the Italian Government
                            concurring in the action of the Commission.</p>

                        <p>For further explanation my Government wishes to state, that it considers
                            the probability of resorting to the additional securities mentioned on
                            the third place very remote, nay almost out of question, as the receipts
                            from customs and tobacco monopoly are four times the amount needed to
                            take care of the service of the League of Nations-Loan and will be
                            thrice the amount required for covering interest and sinking fund on
                            both loans (the League of Nations-Loan and the new Investment Loan).</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>In view of the fact, however, that the new Investment Loan, unlike the
                            first one, will not be vouched by an international guaranty, it seems
                            inadvisable to my Government to strengthen this unavoidable discrepancy
                            in the value of these two loans by restricting beforehand the volume of
                            securities accessible for the new Investment Loan.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Government of Austria requests, therefore, the Government of
                            the United States of America to consent to the release from the prior
                            charge in favor of the Relief Bonds, of the custom-revenues, the gross
                            receipts of the tobacco monopoly and of such other revenues and receipts
                            of the Federal Government of Austria as may in future and under certain
                            circumstances be required to cover the service.</p>

                        <p>The Federal Government of the Republic of Austria has notified the
                            Government of the United States that it intends to pledge for the new
                            investment loan the following resources, to wit: (1) the revenues of the
                            customs; (2) the gross receipts of the tobacco monopoly; (3) such parts

                            in view of the proviso contained in the resolution the Secretary of the
                            Treasury will not be in a position to take such action unless and until
                            substantially similar action has been taken by the Governments of

                            and Switzerland. In this connection you will note that the Resolution
                            empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to determine when the proviso has
                            been substantially complied with.</p>

                            15th, 1928, provides that Austria must obtain the consent of the
                            Governments of the Relief-Creditor-Nations prior to settling certain
                            indebtedness incurred by it through the so-called Forfait-agreement
                            entered upon for the execution of Art. 184 of the Treaty of St. Germain.
                            These obligations which were not affected by the Hague-Convention of
                            January 20, 1930 (Art. IV), are as follows: <table rows="5" cols="4"

                        <p>Of these the debt to France amounting to 16.237 gold kronen is secured by
                            a Treasury note, originally due on July 1st 1929 but subsequently
                            deferred to July 1st 1930. As this amount may in the course of pending
                            negotiations be subjected to some minor alteration, the Federal
                            Government of Austria, wishing to provide for a safe margin, places the
                            total amount of the Forfait-indebtedness at 850.000 gold kronen, for the
                            payment of which amount it asks the consent of the Governments of the
                            Relief-Creditor-Nations.</p>
                        <p>A major portion of this indebtedness will not be settled in cash but
                            credited in way of compensation against certain claims which Austria is
                            holding against the aforementioned countries.</p>
                        <p>At the instance of my Government I have the honor to ask Your <pb n="402"
                                xml:id="pg_402" facs="0482"/>Excellency’s kind intermediary with a
                            view of obtaining the consent of the Government of the United States to
                            the settlement by Austria of the so-called Forfait-debts not exceeding
                            the total amount of 850.000 gold kronen.</p>
                        <p>To avoid delays in pending negotiations and in view of the fact that the
                            above referred to Treasury Note to France falls due on July 1st, an
                            early action on this request will be highly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>An identical request was submitted to the Relief Committee by our
                            Minister in London.</p>

                        <p>41. Department’s 43, May 29, 5 p.m. Foreign Office official informs me
                            that according to interpretation by Ministry of Finance of phrase
                            referred to, Italian Government does not wish to agree to any proposals
                            the conditions of which are contrary to the terms of the agreements
                            reached at The Hague, some of which have already been ratified and some
                            of which are still in the process of ratification. For the Department’s
                            further information, Italian text of above-mentioned phrase reads:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“il rilascio di queste garenzie è subordinato agli Accordi dell’

                        <p>[Paraphrase.] I have been told by Austrian Minister here in Rome that the

                            result of conversations held recently with officials of the Italian
                            Foreign Office in which the Minister called attention to certain
                            inaccuracies which he states were contained in the note of May 20. He
                            believes these inaccuracies were based on misunderstandings between the
                            Ministry of Finance and the Foreign Office. The hope has also been
                            expressed by the Austrian Minister that the explanations contained in
                            this last note may be cabled immediately to London where the Austrian
                            Minister of Finance is arriving to confer regarding the Austrian loan. I
                            have told him that I would send the Department information to that
                            effect. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>195. Reparation 312. The Commission has just received a letter from the
                            Austrian Minister at Paris to the effect that in the negotiations taking
                            place in London for the projected Austrian loan the American bankers
                            have stated that United States Treasury before subordinating its relief
                            bond lien on Austrian assets in favor of the new loan would insist on
                            the formal fulfillment of the condition expressed in Public Resolution
                            Number 81, approved February 4, 1929, “that the Reparation Commission
                            has given an appropriate release in respect of such loan”. The Austrian
                            section of the Commission is meeting this afternoon to consider the
                            question and will probably recommend the Commission to adopt at its
                            meeting on the 28th instant a decision to the effect that as of the date
                            of putting into force of the Hague agreement of January 20, 1930,
                            concerning Austria, the first charge on Austrian assets created by
                            article 197 of the Treaty of Saint Germain ceases to have any
                            effect.</p>

                            <p>That the President of the Republic, Dr. Hernando Siles, basing his
                                opinion on the grave condition of the state and desiring to
                                consolidate the institutionary of the country, has resigned today
                                irrevocably his high office, thus preventing himself from
                                intervening in the solution of the political problem raised by
                                parliamentary and popular manifestations soliciting his continuance
                                in the Government;</p>
                            <p>That it is necessary to normalize the institutional progress of the
                                Republic, giving the Nation the possibility of resolving its own
                                problems by itself with high civic spirit;</p>
                            <p>That the majority of the Nation has manifested the urgent necessity
                                of proceeding with the constitutional reform for which it is
                                indispensable to have recourse to the popular will, fountainhead of
                                sovereignty;</p>
                            <p>That the ordinary National Congress is not endowed with sufficient
                                power to resolve the existing problems nor to fix the standard
                                conducive to the normalization of the institutional life of the
                                Republic;</p>
                            <p>That the public administration cannot remain unattended without
                                producing grave disorder and jeopardizing the stability of the
                                Nation;</p>
                            <p>That the merely transitory functions imposed upon the Council of
                                Ministers, by the exceptional circumstances of the present time,
                                should last only for the time strictly necessary to consult the
                                desire of the country, meanwhile [directing] the administration and
                                fulfilling the external obligations which the Republic has
                                incurred,</p>

                        <p>This afternoon there was a meeting of the diplomatic corps to discuss
                            what attitude should be taken toward the new Government. Three points
                            were raised: <list>

                                <item>Whether, in view of the fact that this Government is in
                                    reality a continuation of President Siles’ administration
                                    although unconstitutional, relations should not be continued
                                    normally with the exception of treaty negotiations.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Whether if relations are continued normally this does not give
                                    tacit recognition to an unconstitutional government which might
                                    prove embarrassing later, particularly as there is a grave
                                    possibility that the power may be seized by an individual before
                                    the Constituent Assembly meets.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Whether a formal act of recognition should be made and if so
                                    to whom should it be addressed.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The consensus of opinion was that nothing should be done which would
                            embarrass the present administration and that it was therefore desirable
                            to have uniformity of action by all representatives. However no one was
                            prepared to commit his Government and it was decided that each should
                            cable for instructions. I therefore respectfully request instructions as
                            soon as possible as there will be another meeting of the corps on Monday
                            afternoon in view of the arrival of the new Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <p>As far as American interests are concerned the question of recognition
                            has importance as the bankers must decide whether they will permit this
                            Government to draw on funds now deposited in New York for future
                            payments on the service of the Bolivian external debt.</p>

                        <p>33. My telegram No. 32, May 29, 6 p.m. The Brazilian Minister has just
                            called to inform me that he has received instructions from his
                            Government in the following sense concerning the recognition of the
                            present Bolivian Government. Brazil will assume the same attitude as
                            that taken in 1920 at the time of the Saavedra revolution when Brazil
                            and the United States acted in unison in maintaining cordial relations
                            with the Provisional Government but refused to recognize Government
                            constitutionality or to negotiate with it.<note n="4" xml:id="d413fn4"

                            the United States will also take this attitude, as it is felt that to do

                        <p>34. All diplomatic representatives received practically the same
                            instructions as contained in Department’s telegram 20, June 2, noon.</p>
                        <p>There are signs of dissension among the members of the Cabinet Council
                            and reports from the interior indicate that some of the departments,
                            particularly Cochabamba and Potosi, are not satisfied with the present
                            regime. Fidel Vega appears to be strongest Minister and it is commonly
                            expected that he will place himself at the head of the Provisional
                            Government, thus becoming a formidable rival for Siles should elections
                            actually be held. Both the Liberal and Republican Parties have invited
                            Saavedra to return, but so far he has given no indication of his
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>I gather from conversations with the Paraguayan Minister that his
                            Government will not begin direct negotiations on the Chaco question
                            until there is a constitutional government here.<note n="4a"

                        <p>35. During the past week there have been several demonstrations of the
                            Nationalist Party in favor of Siles and his reelection. They have been
                            fairly orderly although the windows of Saavedra’s house have been
                            broken. There have been smaller counter-demonstrations, during one of
                            which the headquarters of the Nationalist Party were <pb n="419"
                                xml:id="pg_419" facs="0499"/>destroyed. For not controlling the
                            latter, the Chief of Police and his assistant have been transferred to
                            the provinces.</p>
                        <p>An official report this morning announces that Villazon on the Argentine
                            frontier was attacked yesterday by Communists but that the situation is
                            well under control. There is much Communist activity at present
                            particularly among unemployed miners in the Oruro district. Headquarters
                            are said to be in Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of the Interior and Justice Department has resigned and his
                            position filled by Lieutenant Colonel Toro, formerly Minister of Public
                            Works and Communications. Colonel Banzer, previously Minister of
                            Agriculture, has taken the position left vacant by Toro thus giving the
                            Army possession of the two most important Cabinet positions for
                            controlling elections. Ezekiel Romecin has been made Minister of

                            remains very tense. Last night an attempt against the Government here,
                            including plans for Siles’ assassination, was frustrated. There were
                            street demonstrations last night and this morning. In the latter two
                            students agitating against the Government were killed. There is no doubt
                            that the Government exaggerates these demonstrations for the purpose of
                            putting on heavier military restrictions but the situation is serious
                            and there may be grave trouble before the elections next Sunday,
                            particularly as those opposed to the Government are lining up with
                            Communist elements.</p>

                        <p>The Department has received a telegram, dated June 27, 10 a.m.,<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d419fn6">Telegrams from the Chargé in Bolivia, upon
                                which this release is based, are not printed.</note> which was
                            delayed in transmission from Mr. Frederick P. Hibbard, the American
                            Chargé d’Affaires at La Paz, to the effect that on Wednesday night, June
                            25, at 9 o’clock, the cadets of the military college revolted against
                            the Government following the receipt of the news of the successful
                            revolt in Oruro. There was heavy street fighting all during the night
                            and Thursday morning in which other elements opposed to the Government
                            joined and during which the military college was bombarded. The
                            Government troops were able to put down the uprising temporarily,
                            although the majority of the cadets and their sympathizers had not yet
                            surrendered and were barricaded on the outskirts of the city. Several
                            members of the Diplomatic Corps appealed to General Kundt in the
                            interest of humanity to halt the firing, which he did. The telegram adds
                            that the Army has taken control of the Government and a military junta
                            of six ranking colonels is in charge. Most of the members of the cabinet
                            and the nationalist leaders have taken refuge in foreign legations.
                            Ex-President Siles and his family are in the Brazilian Legation.
                            However, the Nationalist Party still refuses to concede control to a
                            military regime, and Mr. Hibbard stated that until this was settled
                            there might be further trouble. Oruro, Cochabamba, Sucre, and Potosi are
                            all in control of military juntas. Everything is quiet in those cities,
                            although there has been street fighting. They are prepared to join La
                            Paz in temporary Army control of the country, but insist that the
                            Nationalist control of the country be broken and that Siles be exiled.
                            Their program is to maintain the present constitution and, when
                            tranquillity is established, to hold the elections in a normal manner.
                            The telegram added that the atmosphere in La Paz was still tense, that
                            shops and public utilities were closed, and that, although the American
                            Legation was in the direct line of firing, no damage had been done to it
                            or to any American property.</p>
                        <p>The Department has received a further telegram, dated June 28, 1 p.m.,
                            from Mr. Hibbard, stating that the cadets, students, and other elements
                            opposed to the Government, who were barricaded on the Altiplano Thursday
                            were joined by the aviation forces and several regiments. Meanwhile,
                            there were continued demonstrations against the Government at La Paz,
                            the crowds demanding the release of political prisoners. The Prefect,
                            Colonel Julio Sanjines, also a member of the military junta, was
                            eventually forced to resign, and the prefecture, <pb n="421"
                                xml:id="pg_421" facs="0501"/>as well as all other Government
                            offices, was taken over by the mob. All political prisoners were
                            released amid a wildly enthusiastic reception. The cadets, aviation
                            troops, line regiments, and armed civilians marched into La Paz where
                            they were joined by the crowd and other military units. During the day
                            there was spasmodic firing. Mr. Hibbard adds that for the time being the
                            Government is controlled by Colonel Pando as military chief, Otero as
                            prefect, with Bustamante, President of the Banco Central, and Elio,
                            former Minister for Foreign Affairs, as advisers. They are awaiting the
                            arrival of military representatives from the other provinces when a new
                            military junta will be formed to govern until constitutional elections
                            can be called. The telegram adds that Friday afternoon the houses of
                            ex-President Siles, Taborga, Romecin, Sanjines, Vega, Kundt, and other
                            Nationalist leaders were sacked and the contents destroyed. Ex-President
                            Siles’ grand piano was burned in the street before the Brazilian
                            Legation. The telegram adds that the battle cries have been for the
                            constitution without mention of individual names and that a white flag
                            is carried with the Bolivian flag. The Army has turned against General
                            Kundt, and he has taken refuge in the German Legation along with the
                            other German military instructors. The majority of the Army is being
                            concentrated at La Paz. Except for enthusiastic street parades with
                            bands, the city is quiet, although many shops are closed and rail and
                            wire communications are irregular. Those in control are taking every
                            measure to prevent further reprisals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hibbard adds that every legation excepting the American and the
                            Italian have political refugees and that it is presumed that
                            arrangements will shortly be made to take them out of the country, or
                            else guarantees will be given them. On Wednesday and Thursday of last
                            week, Bustamante, President of the Banco Central, was in the American
                            Legation. Mr. Hibbard adds that the fact that the American Legation is
                            next to the military college and has been in the center of the trouble,
                            with troops surrounding it, has prevented it from being the asylum of
                            other refugees.</p>
                        <p>Walter I. Gholz, an American teacher in the American Institute, was
                            slightly wounded in the leg by machine-gun fire during the night of
                            Wednesday, June 25, but no other Americans or American property have
                            been injured.</p>
                        <p>A telegram, dated June 28, 4 p.m., from Mr. Hibbard, states that the
                            following junta will govern the country for the present: Colonels
                            Osorio, Pando, Lanza, González Quint, and Bilbao, with Doctor Bustamante
                            as adviser.</p>
                        <p>The telegram states that the junta declares that it will respect the
                            constitution of the nation calling shortly for free elections for
                            deputies and senators and the consequent formation of a constitutional
                            cabinet, <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0502"/>and furthermore that
                            it will comply strictly with the internal and external obligations of
                            the Republic. The telegram added that everything was quiet during the
                            afternoon of June 28, although the people were enjoying a holiday and
                            all shops and offices remained closed.</p>

                        <p>47. The military junta remains well in control of the situation. On
                            Sunday there were threatening demonstrations before those Legations in
                            which political leaders had taken refuge and it was necessary for the
                            diplomatic corps to call on the junta to demand greater protection. This
                            was granted at once and there has been no further trouble. Siles left by
                            automobile at 4 o’clock this morning accompanied by the Secretary of the
                            Brazilian Legation and the Military Attaché of the Chilean Legation and
                            with the protection of the junta. The troops at first refused to let him
                            leave but were pacified and he was taken outside the city and placed on
                            a special train for Arica, where he is now. The other refugees remain
                            where they are but some will leave tomorrow with full guarantees.
                            General Kundt offers the greatest problem. The feeling against him is
                            intense and if he leaves the German Legation it will be difficult for
                            the Government to protect him. On the other hand they do not wish him to
                            leave the country, as it is feared he will sell or divulge Bolivian
                            military plans to neighboring countries. The junta intends to proceed
                            legally against members of the previous Government for malfeasance in
                            office in an effort to secure the return of Government funds. Should the
                            money not be returned, property will be confiscated. Charges are being
                            prepared now.</p>

                        <p>All politicians exiled by Siles are returning but it is interesting to
                            note that there is no mention of party or individuals. For the time
                            being the country is solidly behind the junta. A decree giving the plans
                            of the junta has been issued and has received general approbation.
                            Freedom of the press is guaranteed, martial law, which has been in force
                            for thirty-three months, is lifted and each member of the junta pledges
                            himself not to run for any office.</p>
                        <p>With the aid of the banks, the Government has today telegraphed funds to
                            New York to cover the June 5th and June 15th service payments on the
                            external loan. The Chambers are cooperating fully with the Government in
                            every way. The junta is reducing the number of public employees 25
                            percent and promises to reduce army expenditure. An economic council has
                            been formed to study the needs of the country and make recommendations.
                            Each Ministry is in charge of a member of the junta with a high-class
                            civilian technical adviser. Decrees will be signed by the Under
                            Secretary, the officer in charge, and General Galindo.</p>
                        <p>Elections will be called as soon as there is complete calm. I believe
                            this will not be for some months as it is the desire of the junta and
                            the people in general that all traces of the previous regime be removed
                            and a new start made. Certainly there is an opportunity for a fine
                            example to Bolivia and other South American republics if the junta can
                            follow its original intentions.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that the junta has approached Chile, Brazil, Argentina and
                            Peru for recognition. No answers have yet been received. The question
                            has not yet been raised with the Embassy [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Legation</hi>] although I know the junta is eager for the
                            recognition of the United States. My impression is that the United
                            States will not be asked until they know what reception the request has
                            received in the countries mentioned.</p>

                        <p>48. My telegram No. 47, July 2, 5 p.m. In conversation with an individual
                            in the confidence of the junta, I was informed that the present
                            Government has made no overtures to any neighboring Governments for
                            recognition. The junta, while desirous of recognition, hoped that it
                            would come “spontaneously”. I was asked whether the United States would
                            accord recognition. I stated that I could only reply personally but that
                            my opinion was that the United States would continue normal diplomatic
                            relations with Bolivia; that as far <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"
                                facs="0504"/>as I was aware it had not been customary for the United
                            States to grant <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition to
                            governments constituted as the present Bolivian Government and I advised
                            against raising a question which might prove embarrassing, particularly
                            in view of the announcement of the junta that constitutional elections
                            would be called shortly. I added however that should the Government
                            desire to make a formal request I would, of course, transmit it to the
                            Department at once.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon I called on General Blanco Galindo in accordance with the
                            Department’s telegram No. 24, July 8, 6 p.m.<note n="7" xml:id="d422fn7"
                                >Not printed.</note> He expressed the warm admiration of Bolivia for
                            the United States and a hope that relations would always remain cordial.
                            He added that he hoped relations would shortly be closer between the two
                            countries but that he understood it was not customary for the United
                            States to grant recognition under the circumstances. I made no
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>I have conferred with my Brazilian and Peruvian colleagues who state that
                            in spite of repeated expressions by the junta of the desire to maintain
                            normal and cordial relations with their countries the question of
                            recognition has not been raised. They do not intend to take any action.
                            The Chilean Minister is more vague and my impression is that Chile will
                            endeavor to find some way to strengthen her relations here either by
                            recognition or otherwise in order to hold a predominating influence
                            later.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the Junta
                            Militar of Bolivia has announced elections for the 4th, 5th, and 6th of
                            January, next. On January 4th the electorate will vote on certain
                            amendments or changes in the Bolivian Constitution which have not yet
                            been announced but are now being prepared. These will probably include
                            an extension of the presidential term from four to six years as well as
                            an extension of the congressional term, the inclusion of an article
                            protecting the financial institutions of the country, particularly those
                            established by the recommendations of Professor Kemmerer, such as the
                            Banco Central de Bolivia, the Contraloría General de la República, the
                            National Tax Collecting Company, etc., an article guaranteeing more
                            effectively freedom of speech and action, an article <pb n="425"
                                xml:id="pg_425" facs="0505"/>making the continuance of martial law
                            impossible beyond a limited time, certain educational reforms and other
                            reforms in the electoral law making the control of one party
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>Elections for the presidency and vice presidency will be held on January
                            5th and elections for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on January
                            6th. The old civil registers have been abolished and the citizens of the
                            country will shortly be permitted to re-register. The registration will
                            be controlled by military officers as well as the actual voting though
                            in the latter there may be civil assistants appointed. The stamp tax on
                            cards of identity, which are required of all voters has been abolished
                            and only the voting requirements specified in the Constitution will be
                            demanded. It is expected thus to secure a more popular and
                            representative vote.</p>
                        <p>During the past week representatives of the three political parties, the
                            Liberal, Republican and Genuine Republican, have met at the invitation
                            of the Junta Militar to discuss plans for a representative election
                            which would make possible the accomplishment of the revolutionary ideals
                            and a popular government. There has been much speculation as to what
                            means could be taken to avoid party rivalry and whether the party
                            leaders would be able to submerge their personal ambitions for the
                            benefit of the country. After much discussion of a highly patriotic
                            character, a solution has been reached which seems to be the only one
                            possible. The official representatives of the three parties have
                            officially committed themselves to the following ticket. For the
                            Presidency, Doctor Daniel Salamanca, first vice president, Doctor Ismael
                            Montes, second vice president, Doctor Bautista Saavedra. In this way
                            each party has a representative, although such a system will necessitate
                            a slight change in the Constitution which was amended in 1920 to abolish
                            the position of second vice president. It is presumed that the Congress
                            and Cabinet will likewise be coalition in character.</p>
                        <p>The announcement of this program has been received with universal
                            pleasure. Doctor Salamanca has occupied a unique position in the
                            political life of the country as he has always remained free of party
                            affiliations in spite of his service in various governmental offices. He
                            is honest and intelligent but lacks the force to lead the country from
                            its present crisis. The weakness of his health is a great handicap both
                            physically and temperamentally. His aloofness from party affiliations
                            will also be a handicap as it is impossible for the political life of
                            the country to remain on such an elevated plane and he will be unable by
                            temperament to combat party struggles which must necessarily arise in
                            such a coalition.</p>

                        <p>The Minister stated that the telegram instructed him to inform this
                            Government of the foregoing and he stated that if he might he would
                            report that he had complied with the instructions and that the
                            Department had expressed gratification at the developments cited. I told
                            him that he could of course make such a statement, as we were indeed
                            gratified by any developments which seemed, as this does, to hold
                            promise for the future stability of Bolivia. I told him that we have not
                            as yet received any report from the Legation at La Paz on this
                            subject.</p>

                        <p>59. During the past week there have been several demonstrations of
                            unemployed, many of which have been inspired by Communists. In the
                            southern districts, particularly Oruro and Potosi, several mining camps
                            have been damaged. While the Government is apparently well in control,
                            there is a distinct feeling of uneasiness, especially as there is good
                            reason to believe that members of the former Government are aligning
                            themselves with Communist elements.</p>
                        <p>In view of this situation, I have not yet made informal contacts with
                            members of the junta as I have not wanted to make any move which might
                            be interpreted as even tacit recognition. The question of recognition by
                            the United States frequently arises, especially since the recognition of
                            this Government by Peru and Ecuador and the probable recognition by
                            Argentina. For these reasons my position here is embarrassing and I
                            would prefer to leave La Paz until such time as the situation is more
                            normal. I respectfully request the Department’s instructions.</p>

                        <p>63. Department’s telegram number 38, September 16, 2 p.m. In accordance
                            with the Department’s instructions I called on Colonel Osorio with Mr.
                            Feely this morning at 10 and informed him that I had been instructed by
                            the Government of the United States to enter into full diplomatic
                            relations with the Government of Bolivia. I also handed him a note
                            confirming this and requesting him to set the date for Mr. Feely to
                            present his credentials. In discussing the question of credentials, I
                            informed Colonel Osorio that these documents were addressed to the
                            President of Bolivia and inquired whether it would be inconvenient to
                            present them in that form and was informed that the Junta would prefer
                            to have the credentials addressed to His Excellency General Carlos
                            Blanco Galindo, President of the Military Junta of Government of
                            Bolivia. However the Junta is anxious to avoid delay in receiving Mr.
                            Feely. Accordingly it is being arranged for him to be received by
                            General Galindo probably Saturday. Upon receipt of new credentials these
                            will be deposited at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. If the Department
                            approves it will be appreciated if new credentials can be sent by the
                            next pouch.</p>

                        <p>70. In view of increasing difficulty in meeting foreign debt service and
                            critical financial outlook, this Government is planning to invite a
                            commission of interested American bankers to visit Bolivia for the
                            purpose of discussing plans of consolidation of outstanding indebtedness
                            and for recommending other steps toward avoidance of financial collapse,
                            moratorium, etc. Government will suggest that one member of commission
                            to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] represent State Department or Commerce
                            Department, and also plans the appointment of Bolivian representatives,
                            probably Martínez Vargas and Carlos Arimayo, to proceed to New York for
                            the same purpose.</p>
                        <p>Former Minister for Foreign Affairs Elio in an article yesterday’s <hi
                                rend="italic">La Razon</hi> recommends the suspension of foreign
                            debt service; and pressure is apparent to reduce gold value of boliviano
                            from 18 pence to 12 pence which, in my opinion, might result in collapse
                            of entire financial structure.</p>
                        <p>Financial situation grows more critical daily and unless some plan can be
                            evolved to reduce debt service materially a long period of default seems
                            inevitable beginning with heavy payments due in December and
                            January.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully suggest that bankers should be notified of forthcoming
                            invitation.</p>

                        <p>71. My telegram No. 70 of October 13, 4 p.m. Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            today handed me legalized copy of the Supreme Economist Council, saying
                            that this memorandum represented the views of his Government as to
                            practical remedies for the threatening financial crisis. Memorandum
                            which is being forwarded by air mail recites at length causes for
                            present depression, including fall in prices of Bolivia’s principal
                            exportable products, large budget deficit, heavy foreign debt service
                            and unemployment, and points out danger of <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                                facs="0510"/>spread of communism as a result, and probable inability
                            to meet December and January quotas of debt service in spite of
                            Government’s desire to maintain its credit abroad.</p>
                        <p>Memorandum arrives at certain conclusions which Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs requested I transmit as an official invitation to the bankers
                            concerned, at the same time intimating that the Bolivian Government
                            would welcome the appointment of an official representative of the
                            United States Government on the proposed commission.</p>
                        <p>The conclusions are as follows: That a commission made up of
                            representatives of the American bankers interested be immediately
                            organized and that the Republic of the United States be requested to
                            appoint an official representative on the commission; that said
                            commission recommend a plan of consolidating foreign debt; investigate
                            the possibility of investment American and Bolivian capital in new
                            industries; that the organization of the commission be negotiated
                            simultaneously with the United States Government and American bankers by
                            the American Minister in La Paz and Martínez Vargas already appointed
                            Bolivian Special Agent in New York and Washington; that if Martínez
                            Vargas decides consolidation can be arranged in New York commission need
                            not come to La Paz; that as December-January debt service amounts to
                            $1,838,000 negotiations should be undertaken immediately so that
                            commission’s recommendations may be made effective and if possible
                            short-term credit accorded by bankers for December-January service if
                            consolidation plan is not completed then.</p>
                        <p>In accepting the memorandum I expressed the opinion that, while the
                            Department would undoubtedly be pleased to transmit the invitation to
                            the bankers and would follow the course of any negotiations with
                            interest, I could not assure him that my Government would accept an
                            invitation to participate officially. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            then suggested that invitation be transmitted to the bankers and that I
                            ask what the Department’s attitude would be toward the appointment of an
                            official representative on the commission. Telegraphic instructions
                            would be appreciated.</p>

                            great progress toward their goal of entering São Paulo and Rio <pb

                            they had been occupying for 24 hours. Rumors concerning their approach
                            to São Paulo from the south are believed to be either untrue or based
                            upon the activities of isolated bands of revolutionary sympathizers
                            along the railway in northern Paraná. In Minas Geraes the revolutionary
                            forces appear to have been held in check, if not actually repulsed.</p>
                        <p>Friends of the Government are today optimistic and feel that the only
                            danger to the Government is in an uprising in São Paulo or Rio de
                            Janeiro. Consul General Cameron reports that São Paulo is quiet and
                            friendly to the Government but that account must be taken of the
                            presence of about 800 Communists in the city. The situation in Rio de
                            Janeiro is similar. Business is at a standstill in São Paulo and in Rio
                            de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>Consul at Bahia reports that all is quiet there. American-owned power
                            company reports that the Bahia tramway service is operating again.</p>

                        <p>78. American Consul at Pernambuco telegraphs that he might request
                            assistance in case of a Federal attack upon Pernambuco. A responsible
                            official of the Foreign Office informed me that no effort would be
                            spared by the military and naval commanders, who were approaching that
                            city, to retake it for the Government even if it meant bombardment.</p>
                        <p>The American Consul at Bahia reports street firing between sailors and
                            police and states that Americans are nervous because of anti-American
                            feeling among the lower classes. He requests me to inform him whether
                            any American warships are expected in that vicinity.</p>
                        <p>Since it appears very probable that a serious engagement will take place
                            at Pernambuco which would endanger the lives of Americans and of
                            foreigners I invite the Department’s consideration to the question of
                            having American naval vessels in that vicinity.</p>

                        <p>57. Your 78, October 9, 4 p.m. The Department would be very loath to send
                            any warships to Brazil. Cannot the Consuls in ports where there is apt
                            to be fighting make arrangements in conjunction with the other foreign
                            Consuls by which the foreign colonies can be put in a place of safety?
                            Please take this matter up at once with the federal authorities so that
                            instructions may be sent to the commanders of the federal troops in all
                            places to respect American and other foreign lives and have the Consuls
                            in each place make similar representations to the commanders of the
                            opposition forces so that a neutral zone can be declared and respected.
                            Cable results as soon as possible. Enquire of Consuls whether it is
                            feasible in case of emergency to take Americans off by merchant ships
                            and what ships are now available or will be available in the next few
                            days in each port for this purpose. Cable number of Americans in each
                            port for which means of egress may have to be provided.</p>

                        <p>83. Department’s 57, October 9, 7 p.m. I have transmitted the
                            Department’s instructions to the Consuls at Pernambuco and Bahia in
                            which cities there are prospects of disturbances, but have not yet
                            received replies regarding their representations to the local
                            authorities and regarding the number of Americans and ships in their
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs assures me that the Federal Government
                            will give attention to foreigners insofar as it is able. He states that
                            as Recife is in the hands of the rebels the Consuls should arrange with
                            the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities to remove all foreigners
                            to a place of safety outside the city in the case of an attack.</p>
                        <p>However, it now appears that several days or a week may elapse before an
                            attack on Recife takes place and the Federal Government is convinced
                            that when its forces appear before Recife the rebels will flee. As the
                            foreign Consuls in that city are in the best position to judge this, I
                            shall transmit the Minister’s statement to our Consul.</p>
                        <p>As the Federal naval and military forces appear to be concentrating at
                            Bahia there would seem to be no danger of any trouble there at the
                            present time. I pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the
                            importance of always leaving sufficient forces at Bahia to insure the
                                <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0515"/>safety of Americans and he
                            assures me that attention will be given to this aspect of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>As there is not yet any prospect of a Federal attack upon Porto Alegre I
                            will postpone communicating the Department’s instruction in this matter
                            to our Consul there until I am certain of having established
                            communication with him.</p>

                                <p>“In view of the uncertainty as to the future situation in Brazil
                                    it has been felt prudent to have a ship nearer the zone of
                                    disturbance to take off American refugees, should such action be
                                    necessary for the protection of their lives. The U. S. S. <hi

                                    merely to take off Americans whose lives might be in danger.
                                    This would be the sole object of its visit to any Brazilian

                        <p>88. Department’s telegram number 60. The statement issued by the
                            Department to the press in connection with the ordering of the U. S. S.
                                <hi rend="italic">Pensacola</hi> to Guantanamo is giving concern to
                            the Brazilian Government and I have been informed by a responsible

                            Brazil will not be permitted by the censors. In view of the fact that
                            perfect order reigns in the Districts of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo
                            and that the Brazilian Government is attempting to create greater
                            confidence among the people, it is feared that the publication of this
                            notice issued by a foreign government would produce a very bad
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if the Department would state to the press when
                            the week end is past that this Embassy has continuously been reporting
                            that Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo were quiet and that there has been no
                            danger to American lives or property in these cities.</p>

                        <p>96. Today I have been verbally informed by the Segundo Official de
                            Gabinete of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Brazilian
                            Government has closed the port of Recife. Under date of October 11 it
                            ordered its Consuls throughout the world not to clear any more vessels
                            for that port. He also requested this Embassy to order American merchant
                            vessels already cleared for Recife to proceed to another port. The
                            Consul at Recife is anxious over the food supply of city and in one of
                            his telegrams has urged that American vessels continue calling there as
                            usual. There being a question of international law involved, namely,
                            whether a nation has the right to close a port which though in its
                            territory is not under its control, the matter is referred to the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>97. This Embassy has just received a written communication from the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that Brazilian Consuls have received
                            from the Ministry, in accordance with orders from the Federal Inspection
                            of Navigation, instructions not to visa until further notice for
                            military and administrative reasons the papers of ships destined to the
                            following Brazilian ports: São Luiz, Fortaleza and all ports of Ceará,
                            Rio Grande do Norte, Parahyba, Pernambuco and Alagoas; Paranaguá, São
                            Francisco, and the ports of Rio Grande do Sul, all of which ports are
                            temporarily closed to navigation.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with a responsible official of the Brazilian Foreign
                            Office I have learned that the Brazilian Government is well aware of the
                            claims on the part of foreign shipping companies which may arise as a
                            result of trying to close the above-mentioned ports but considers it
                            essential that the revolutionists not receive arms, ammunition or other
                            supplies. Furthermore, it fears that some such supplies <pb n="437"
                                xml:id="pg_437" facs="0517"/>are on boats which were cleared for
                            Recife before the issuance of the consular instruction and therefore is
                            desirous that foreign governments cause such vessels to proceed to
                            another port.</p>

                            October 16, 1930, contains the following clause: “Considering that in
                            consequence of a subversive movement which broke out in the States of

                            prepared to welcome revolutionists. Cruiser can control city and prevent
                            entrance but its action is doubtful. Launch has been provided to take
                            Americans away in case of emergency, but the only available place is an

                        <p>109. In view of the reports from Bahia, it is recommended that the IT. S.

                        <p>There is a distinct feeling of dissatisfaction in Rio de Janeiro over
                            what appears to the public to be inactivity on the part of the
                            Government in proceeding against the revolutionists. The disturbing news
                            from the vicinity of Bahia and Victoria is threatening the morale of the
                            Government supporters in this city.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] From reliable sources it has been learned that several
                            times during the last two weeks high Army and Navy officials, and
                            possibly an actual member of the Cabinet, have urged the President to
                            reach some agreement with the revolutionists in order to save the
                            country from a long civil war, but he has persistently refused to
                            compromise and they have remained loyal to him. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>Referring to my telegram of October 17, 4 p.m., regarding payments for
                            requisitions, these will be paid by state treasury notes of Rio Grande
                            do Sul to be recalled in 6 months and which can be used at once in
                            payment of all Federal, state and municipal taxes including customs
                            duties, also in payment wages and in purchase raw materials and
                            foodstuffs. All requisitions American property will be paid by these
                                notes.<note n="8" xml:id="d457fn8">In telegram of October 22, 3
                                p.m., the Consul added that “treasury notes bear seven and a half
                                interest.”</note> This should be very beneficial to American
                            companies having requisitions. I have been to see Secretary of the
                            Interior and Secretary of the Treasury several times about this and the
                            present solution of the matter is due mostly to my efforts. Total amount
                            20,000 contos of these treasury notes will be issued having as guarantee
                            like amount of mortgage bonds of State Bank of Rio Grande do Sul to be
                            deposited in state treasury but not all of this issue will be used for
                            requisitions. This measure will facilitate very much all commercial
                            transactions.</p>

                        <p>Some accounts in the press this morning reported that our action in
                            placing an embargo upon the sale of arms and munitions to revolutionists
                            in Brazil was unprecedented. While it is true that this is the first
                            occasion where the United States has placed an embargo on the shipment
                            of arms and munitions to a South American country, it is misleading to
                            call it an unprecedented action, as it is our regular action under
                            similar circumstances. We have placed embargoes on the shipment of arms
                            and munitions on various occasions when there were conditions of
                            domestic violence in Central America, Mexico, Cuba, and the Orient.<note

                            happens that a situation requiring the application of this principle has
                            not hitherto come up in South America, and there has therefore hitherto
                            been no occasion for applying the general principle. There is nothing
                            unprecedented in the principle which we have applied many times before.
                            It is very important that people should not misunderstand it as a new
                            principle. It is important for the reason that the revolutionists who
                            may be hurt by our action in placing an embargo may assert that we are
                            taking sides for some ulterior reason with one or the other of the
                            combatants. Instead of that, we are acting according to general
                            principles of international law. Those principles declare that where we
                            are in friendly relations through diplomatic channels with a government
                            which has been recognized as the legitimate government of a country,
                            that government is entitled to the ordinary rights of any government to
                            buy arms in this country; while the people who are opposing and trying
                            to overthrow that government and are not yet recognized as belligerents
                            are not entitled to that right. It is not a matter of choice on our
                            part, but is a practice of mankind known as international law. We have
                            no personal bias and are doing nothing but attempting to carry out the
                            law of mankind.</p>

                            establishing normal conditions which have only been slightly disturbed.
                            President remains a prisoner in Presidential Palace. Popular enthusiasm
                            expressed in carnival spirit. Offices of late Government newspapers
                            sacked and building, property of <hi rend="italic">O Paiz</hi>, burnt.
                            Red flags displayed indicate revolution and not communism. An Army
                            detachment has occupied the Bank of Brazil to protect it and the

                        <p>141. A circular note, dated November 3rd, from the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs was received yesterday afternoon stating that the <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0527"/>provisional junta had delivered the
                            administration of the country to Dr. Getulio Vargas who assumed its
                            direction in the character of chief of the Provisional Government as
                            delegate of the victorious revolution.</p>
                        <p>The circular also gives the names of the Ministers of State appointed by
                            Vargas and repeats the statement regarding respect for national
                            obligations contracted abroad, existing treaties, etc., contained in
                            circular reported in Embassy’s telegram 131, October 27, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>The note closed as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In addressing Your Excellency I assure you that we desire to

                        <p>78. Your 139, November 4, 3 p.m. I recognize how difficult it is to
                            appraise the present situation in Brazil and, for that reason, I am
                            going very slowly in making a decision regarding the question of
                            recognizing the present authorities in Brazil. The Department’s
                            information is extremely meager, and now, when this very important
                            matter is under consideration, I need especially very careful advice
                            from you based not only on your long experience as a diplomat, but also
                            on your long residence in Brazil and your knowledge of the situation <pb
                                n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0528"/>in Brazil. I desire to receive
                            from you, therefore, an appraisal of the present situation, based not
                            only on your present information, but also on your long residence in
                            Brazil, as to the causes of the revolution and the hold that the present
                            administration has on the Brazilian people. Your statement in this
                            respect should be based not on the assertions of the present members of
                            the Government but on your estimate of their past history and character.
                            While Brazil is a large country with scanty means of communication, I
                            desire, nevertheless, as complete information as you can furnish with
                            regard to the attitude of the various states toward the new
                            administration, and whether there is likely to be any counterrevolution
                            or independent uprising against its authority. I also desire your views
                            regarding the ability of the present administration to maintain its
                            control throughout the country, to protect life and property, and its
                            willingness and readiness to recognize international obligations.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the large extent and difficult character of the country,
                            scantiness of communications, etc., it is my view that we should go
                            slow; and we will not be hurried by Great Britain in determining what is
                            the proper action for us to take; but in this matter I desire your full
                            and frank views and recommendations. I shall not be able to come to a
                            proper determination of the matter without complete information, and
                            rely on you to keep me fully informed in regard to everything which
                            bears in any way on the situation. For instance, the press reported that
                            the present administration would ask for a recount of the votes cast
                            during the last election on the charge that Senhor Prestes was elected
                            by fraud. If this is done and should the recount show that Senhor Vargas
                            was constitutionally elected, this would, of course, materially alter
                            the situation after November 15, when the term of office will regularly
                            begin. Again I say that I am relying on you for full information and
                            suggestions in the premises.</p>

                        <p>79. Your 141, November 5, 11 a.m. This afternoon the British Ambassador
                            called to say that he is being instructed to answer the Foreign
                            Minister’s circular note on November 8, unless he receives later
                            instructions to the contrary, by saying that the change in Government in
                            Brazil will not cause any change in the diplomatic relations between
                            Great Britain and Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador added that he trusted that this action would not
                            inconvenience the Government of the United States in its consideration
                            of the matter.</p>
                        <p>We had an understanding with the British Ambassador that the American and
                            British Governments would keep one another informed of their intended
                            action in the matter. The British Ambassador was told that the
                            Government of the United States had not yet reached a decision in the
                            matter; that a request was sent to our Ambassador in Brazil on November
                            5 for further information on which to base our decision and that when we
                            had the reply of our Ambassador and had determined upon a course of
                            action he would be advised thereof.</p>
                        <p>I am not prepared to make a decision in the matter and therefore cannot
                            give you the instructions requested in the last sentence of your
                            telegram No. 141, November 5, 11 a.m., until I receive a full detailed
                            reply to my telegram No. 78, November 5, 2 p.m. Please reply as soon as

                                    the Executive will has been growing for 20 years and could be

                            </list></p>
                        <p>All states have accepted the new administration and a counterrevolution
                            or independent uprising against the authority of the new administration
                            is unlikely. Military leaders may disagree, but improbably to a degree
                            which would seriously disturb the public order. I believe that the
                            present administration is able to maintain its control of the country
                            and to protect life and property. The present administration has
                            officially declared its willingness and readiness to recognize
                            international obligations. See my 141, November 5, 11 a.m.</p>
                        <p>Press report that the present administration will call for a recount of
                            the votes of the last election is not true. It is probable that the
                            Provisional Government will dissolve Congress and issue a call for the
                            election of a body to revise the present Constitution following to a
                            certain extent the precedent established when the Empire fell. An
                            official declaration of this intention has not yet been made. If by
                            November 15 the situation is unaltered and is likely to remain so,
                            recognition might be advantageous.</p>

                        <p>81. Your 144, November 7, noon. While your telegram indicates that the
                            new administration is in <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> control and
                            promises and <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0531"/>is able to fulfill
                            the international obligations upon which recognition would be
                            postulated, yet you do not advise me directly as to your views upon
                            recognition and the inference of the last paragraph seems to be that you
                            do not advise recognition at present in spite of the facts which you
                            have previously stated. I am not able to understand the object in
                            waiting for a call for an election of a constitutional convention unless
                            we also wait for the resulting action of such a convention which would
                            involve a very long delay. In the cases of Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru
                            we recognized upon the frank basis of a control by a <hi rend="italic"
                                >de facto</hi> government. Are you willing to advise that the <hi

                            Brazil is sufficiently complete for similar prompt action?</p>

                            my opinion that the Provisional Government fully controls the country
                            and is supported by the people. Do not see the necessity of postponing
                            recognition until after Nov. 15, since conditions appear to be fulfilled
                            here which justified recognition of present Argentine Government.</p>

                        <p>83. After you have answered circular note of November 3, as instructed
                            earlier this morning, you will please say to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs that in carrying out its traditional policy of friendship for
                            Brazil, the Government of the United States is continuing the embargo on
                            the export of arms from the United States to Brazil.<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d480fn16">At the request of the Brazilian Embassy, the
                                President of the United States on March 2, 1931, issued a
                                proclamation (46 Stat. 3050) lifting the embargo on the export of
                                arms and munitions to Brazil (832.113/61).</note> Under this embargo
                            the export of arms is prohibited except to the Government of Brazil,
                            which is now recognized by the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>At the same time you may make it clear, in case there should be any doubt
                            in the mind of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the action of the
                            Government of the United States in placing an embargo on the export of
                            arms to Brazil was not motivated by any partisan feeling whatsoever in
                            the recent revolutionary movement. Such action is required by a
                            convention now in force between the United States and Brazil, signed at

                            was ratified by the President of the United States on May 7, 1930, the
                            ratifications of the United States being deposited at the Pan American
                            Union on May 21, 1930, and the treaty proclaimed by the President on
                            June 6, 1930. This treaty has also been ratified by Brazil, the
                            ratifications having been deposited at the Pan American Union on
                            September 3, 1929.</p>
                        <p>It is the feeling of the Department that if you will bring this matter to
                            the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs it should dispel any
                            possible misunderstanding which may exist as to the action of the
                            Government of the United States in the premises.</p>

                        <p>77. Your 140, November 4, 4 p.m. There were negotiations during most of
                            the summer with the Brazilian Ambassador regarding the change desired by
                            the Brazilian Government in paragraph 16 of Article 4 of the contract
                            for the Naval Mission to Brazil.<note n="23" xml:id="d487fn23"><p>The
                                    paragraph under reference reads as follows: “The officers of the
                                    Mission will be accorded rights and privileges habitually
                                    granted to diplomatic representatives accredited to Brazil and
                                    of corresponding rank, except with regard to rights of
                                    importation already covered in a preceding clause.”</p>
                                <p>The Brazilian Government had suggested that it be modified to
                                    read as follows: “The American officers of the Naval Mission are
                                    exempt from civil and criminal jurisdiction in Brazil and are
                                    not subject to personal taxes.” (832.30/209.)</p></note> The
                            Navy Department did not wish the change. The Ambassador finally
                            discussed the matter with the Secretary of State on October 9th and it
                            appeared that the English wording was all right but the Portuguese text
                            was not a very accurate translation and that that was perhaps the cause
                            of the difficulty. The Secretary of State and the Ambassador agreed that
                            this paragraph should be changed to read as follows: “The officers of
                            the Mission will be accorded rights, immunities and privileges
                            habitually granted to diplomatic representatives accredited to Brazil.”
                            The Secretary of the Navy also agreed. The Ambassador cabled his
                            Government to obtain its consent and asked for authority to propose this
                            wording as the suggestion of the Brazilian Government. This
                            authorization was granted and the Ambassador submitted a note dated
                            October 21 that was received in the Department the following day and in
                            the office handling the matter on October 23. A copy of the note was
                            sent to the Navy Department for its formal approval and this was not
                            received until the 24th, or after the revolution had taken place.</p>
                        <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0536"/>
                        <p>The Secretary discussed the matter with the Ambassador on October 31. The
                            latter stated that he had cabled the previous day to Mr. Mello Franco
                            outlining the negotiations and stating that he had sent the Department a
                            note on October 21 under instructions of Mr. Mello Franco’s predecessor
                            and asking instructions in the premises. The Ambassador added that the
                            only way out he could suggest would be that, as the agreement was to be
                            consummated by an exchange of notes and his note had already been
                            despatched before the Brazilian Government fell, the Secretary answer
                            that note dating his answer October 21 also so that there would be no
                            question of recognition. If the Secretary agreed to this proposal the
                            Ambassador would make it to his Government as the Ambassador’s own
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was not in favor of this course of action
                            because the new authorities in Rio perhaps do not know us and might
                            think we were trying to bring pressure to bear to continue the Naval
                            Mission and also because there might be changes in the present Brazilian
                            authorities. If the present authorities were later succeeded by others,
                            the new authorities might feel that the United States Government had
                            foisted upon the temporary authorities an agreement for 4 years for the
                            Mission which would not be to their liking. The Secretary said that he
                            thought a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> could be entered into
                            until a new government is recognized which can decide whether it desires
                            to make a definite contract.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador recurred to his suggestion for a note from the Secretary
                            dated October 21. The Secretary again declined and said that the problem
                            is to find out whether the present Brazilian authorities desire our
                            Naval officers in Brazil or not. If they do not, the quicker we can get
                            them out the better. On the other hand if they desire them to stay, it
                            would be a very easy matter to make a temporary arrangement bridging
                            over the time until a definitive one can be made. The Ambassador said
                            that he would cable to his Government in this sense and indicated a
                            preference that the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> be entered into
                            by you and the Foreign Office in Rio, but promised to advise us of the
                            reply of his Government.</p>
                        <p>This Government of course understands that the Brazilian authorities are
                            very fully preoccupied with more pressing matters and is perfectly
                            willing to have the Mission carry on after the termination of the
                            present contract on November 6th until the Brazilian Government has an
                            opportunity to reach a decision in the matter.</p>

                        <p>153. The Brazilian Foreign Minister told me yesterday in conversation
                            that his Government could not renew the contract of the Naval Mission
                            for reasons which are wholly of a financial character since the work of
                            the Mission and its personnel have been invariably satisfactory. This
                            reason bore evidence of sincerity and it is desirable that the press
                            shall not represent that any other motive exists.</p>
                        <p>As contract for Naval Mission was virtually renewed under former
                            Government and temporary extension requested by present Government,
                            Chief of Mission feels that a sufficient period of time should be
                            arranged to permit official and personal business, such as leases for
                            residences, to be closed with propriety and dignity for all
                            concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With the departure for home of the
                            American Naval Mission to Brazil at the end of January, 1931, I have the
                            honor to request that the Department will discuss with the Navy
                            Department the reassignment of a Naval Attaché to this Embassy. The
                            office of Naval Attaché was discontinued when Captain William Alden
                            Hall, U. S. N., who was assigned in June, 1927, was detailed as a member
                            of the Naval Mission in April, 1929, and employed as an instructor in
                            the Brazilian Naval War College. For a number of years after the Mission
                            was established, however, the Navy Department continued to be
                            represented by an attaché.</p>
                        <p>A new naval attaché might be instructed not only to perform the usual
                            duties of his office, but to serve as a liaison officer between the
                            Brazilian Navy and the traditions of cooperation between the American
                            and Brazilian navies which the Mission during the period of eight years
                            has so efficiently created and developed. It would be indeed regrettable
                            if the moral effect of what has been accomplished should be allowed to
                            fade out because the preservation of suitable means were wanting.
                            Certain departments of the Brazilian Navy must for many years depend on
                            foreign assistance, and when national finances improve, a few foreign
                            officers will be engaged for the Naval War College and for certain
                            technical departments. As large a mission as the one which is to be
                            discontinued will not be necessary because it cannot be adequately
                            employed until the material of the naval service is increased by
                            additional naval vessels of one or another category. The presence of an
                            American Naval Attaché, especially if he has Mission’s associations,
                            will perpetuate the influence of the United States in the Brazilian Navy
                            and will discourage that Navy from turning to European Powers for
                            technical assistance and advice.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that Lieutenant Commander W. H. P. Blandy, U. S.
                            N., who recently arrived to join the Mission, and who having two years
                            shore duty before him need not soon go afloat, shall be detailed as
                            Naval Attaché. Since he and his family are already established in Rio de
                            Janeiro, the Navy Department will be saved the expense of
                            transportation. Personally and professionally he is well equipped for
                            attaché’s duty, and the contacts which he has already made and which he
                            will increase in local naval circles are sound. His rank under existing
                            conditions is sufficiently adequate to prevent embarrassment to himself
                            or to the service from the fact that it is not of higher grade, and he
                            informs me that he will gladly perform the Attaché’s duty if the Navy
                            Department shall detail him.</p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister has told me that the only Naval Attaché whom the
                            Brazilian Navy intends, if possible, to maintain in a foreign capital is
                            the Attaché in Washington, D. C.</p>
                        <p>The subject of this despatch is of unusual importance for the maintenance
                            of our prestige and I bespeak the Department’s earnest consideration of
                            my proposals.</p>

                            which officers of the Mission have enjoyed under the said contract shall
                            be continued to them until January 31 next, upon which date the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: Since having had the
                                pleasure of talking with you on the diplomatic reception day, my
                                Government has informed me that it will be agreeable if the date
                                upon which the connection of the American Naval Mission with the
                                Government of Brazil shall cease shall be fixed for the last day of
                                January, 1931. That is the date which I suggested to you and which
                                you accepted unofficially.</p>
                            <p>If Your Excellency’s Government agrees to that date, may we consider
                                that it shall be the one upon which the work of the Mission shall
                                terminate and the pay shall cease, which the Mission receives from
                                the Brazilian Government.</p>
                            <p>In regard to other expenses relative to the Mission which Your
                                Excellency’s Government will presumably desire to assume, they are
                                covered by Article IV, Sections 4 and 6, of the late naval contract.
                                Although that contract ceased to be operative on November 6 last, it
                                would appear to be proper that the provisions of those sections
                                shall continue to operate inasmuch as they relate to traveling
                                expenses of the Mission to the United States and to the return there
                                of their families, personal effects and household goods. I enclose a
                                copy of the text of Article 4, which includes the two sections in
                                question in case Your Excellency has not a copy at hand.</p>
                            <p>As the termination of the contract of the American Naval Mission with
                                Your Excellency’s Government has been conducted through a
                                “gentleman’s agreement” and not by the interchange of diplomatic
                                notes, I would suggest that Your Excellency should write me
                                personally in the same manner in which I am writing you, expressing
                                your concurrence with the views which this letter contains, or
                                suggesting such modifications therein as Your Government may desire
                                to propose for submission to my own Government.</p>

                                correspondence exchanged between Your Excellency and the Chief of my
                                Cabinet on November 5 last, I have the honor to renew to you and
                                through your intermedium to the American Government, the thanks both
                                of the Brazilian Government and of myself for the attentive manner
                                with which the American Embassy and the State Department met the
                                wishes of the Provisional Government in establishing a temporary <hi
                                    rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between our respective
                                Governments until we were able to examine the question of the
                                renewal of the contract of the American Naval Mission, which
                                terminated on November 6th last.</p>
                            <p>Confirming what I declared verbally to Your Excellency, and in answer
                                to your letter of the 2nd instant, it is my duty to inform you that
                                the Provisional Government, much to its regret, is unable to renew
                                the said contract to continue to utilize the services which, since
                                1922, the brilliant and competent American Naval Mission has so
                                efficiently rendered to our War Marine.</p>
                            <p>The present financial condition of Brazil constitutes the essential
                                and prime preoccupation of the Provisional Government, which, in
                                order to regulate the same, and to meet its obligations abroad, has
                                adopted the strictest program of a reduction of expenses which can
                                be followed without disorganizing the public services.</p>
                            <p>For this purpose, it has carefully examined the budgets inherited
                                from the former Government and has suppressed all expenses which may
                                be postponed.</p>
                            <p>It is my duty to add that, in accordance with the statement which I
                                had the honor to make verbally to Your Excellency, the Provisional
                                Government guarantees to the Naval Mission the rights which are
                                contained in the contract of November 6th, 1922, until the 31st of
                                January next, upon which date all the responsibilities and
                                obligations which the Brazilian Government assumed under the terms
                                of that instrument, shall end.</p>
                            <p>I believe that these terms are fully in accordance with those which
                                Your Excellency and I agreed upon during our last conversation and
                                with the contents of the letter I am now answering.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself [etc.]</p>

                        <p>6. The Department was informed this afternoon by telephone by the
                            National City Bank, New York, that they have received notice that the
                            Government of Brazil will fine the São Paulo branch approximately three
                            million dollars. The fine was recommended by the Inspector General of
                            Banks and two-thirds of the amount goes to the Government and one-third
                            to the Inspector General. The bank states that basis of fine is that
                            their exchange man at São Paulo conspired with a broker without the
                            knowledge of the bank and had been selling sterling exchange in London,
                            Berlin and Buenos Aires to the amount of about one million pounds. The
                            items were not entered on the books and when confirmatory letters came
                            in they were confiscated by him so that managing officer of branch knew
                            nothing of the transaction. On December 30, 1929, the auditor discovered
                            entries in the books not in accordance with the day’s rate and took the
                            matter up first with the exchange man and then with the manager. It
                            appears that if the transactions were successful the exchange manager
                            was to get 25 per cent profit. The transactions were thus disclosed and
                            the bank has since been trying to straighten out the matter with the
                            banks outside of Brazil. These dealings were illegal because made at 120
                            and 180 days whereas local regulation, although it is not a law,
                            prevents such transactions in excess of 90 days.</p>
                        <p>Bank states all facts presented by bank to Inspector General and the
                            Minister of Finance and they believe facts are known to President
                            Washington Luis and also to the Ambassador. Local representatives of
                            bank want the matter reported to Washington and state that if the
                            regulations are valid they did not become effective until January 18, or
                            nearly 3 weeks after the facts were disclosed and the transactions
                            terminated. Bank states it is ex post facto legislation or rather
                            regulation of the banking department designed to permit the fine. Wide
                            publicity of the fine has been given in the Brazilian press but no
                            notice has been served on the bank. Fifteen days after notice is served
                            the bank must put up three million dollars in cash or securities before
                            it can appeal to the Minister of Finance. Bank states there is
                            possibility that matter is done for political effect and requests that
                            notice be not presented to the bank for the time being and certainly not
                            until after the elections next Saturday.</p>

                        <p>8. Your February 28, noon. National City Bank advises Department of the
                            receipt of cable from manager of São Paulo branch stating they are
                            confidentially informed that on February 28, the Minister of Finance
                            issued General Order prohibiting giving guarantees instead of making a
                            cash deposit when appealing fines in the future. Cable adds that if this
                            information is correct the order apparently was issued to apply to the
                            bank’s case and that the Department should call for extraordinary
                            activities on the part of Embassy in order to avoid that one official
                            could levy such a large fine and demand such a large deposit based on
                            his personal judgment which is so openly prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>Please investigate and report also please use your good offices with the
                            Government for an extension of time and also in view of the fact that
                            the National City Bank is a responsible institution that it not be
                            required to make the deposit of guarantee. Cable results.</p>

                            Bank has infringed Brazilian banking regulations and cannot escape the
                            penalty of a fine. These regulations provide that inspectors shall
                            receive a portion thereof. Inadequate supervision by the local officers
                            of the bank created the situation.</p>

                            deposit of the fine has been made subsequent to which it should be
                            possible to obtain a modification of the amount which is excessive. I am

                        <p>12. The Department considers that the fine imposed on the National City
                            Bank has created a most serious situation. Even should the National City
                            Bank be guilty of the infraction of a regulation as charged the fine is
                            out of all proportion to the offense. All profits of the Bank in Brazil
                            will be wiped out if this fine is levied.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information you are informed that the

                            fine be levied. The National City Bank does not want to make any threats
                            to the Government of Brazil and, of course, is not <pb n="468"

                            can readily appreciate the effect this would have on American interests

                            of regulations even on the basis that the Bank is guilty of all the
                            charges made, and the Bank alleges that this is not the case. Please

                        <p>14. Your 10, March 12, 3 p.m. Please say to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs that the Department very much appreciates the interest he has
                            taken in the National City Bank matter and the efforts he is making to
                            bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion. Department feels, as
                            evidently His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil
                            does, that this is a matter of very great importance in the relations
                            between the United States and Brazil, which have been increasing rapidly
                            and which this Government desires to strengthen in every proper way. In
                            this connection it is interesting to note that in 1913 Brazilian imports
                            were $324,000,000, $50,900,000 of which came from the United States, or
                            15.7 per cent. The Brazilian exports in that year were $315,700,000, of
                            which $101,800,000, or 32.2 per cent went to the United States. The
                            National City Bank entered Brazil in 1915 and since that time has been
                            helpful in promoting trade relations between the United States and
                            Brazil. Although not claiming of course that all the increase since that
                            date is due to any one institution it is interesting to see not only how
                            trade has increased but also the increased proportion of Brazil’s trade
                            that is done with the United States. In 1928 Brazilian imports were
                            $442,290,000, of which $117,510,000, or 26.6 per cent came from the
                            United States. Brazilian exports were $475,242,000, of which
                            $215,992,000, or 45.4 per cent went to the United States. Also in 1913
                            Brazil had outstanding loans to the value of $504,335,000, all from
                            European sources. In 1928 Brazil had outstanding loans of £106,970,000
                            Sterling, 333,577,000 Francs, and $152,800,000. The United States share
                            is thus somewhat over 20 per cent of the whole.</p>
                        <p>Banking, of course, plays the most important part in trade and economic
                            relations between two countries and it is therefore very important to
                            guard against anything which might disturb that relationship. The
                            interest and action which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken in
                            this very important matter is another instance of his friendly
                            disposition and desire to cooperate with the United States which is very
                            highly appreciated and reciprocated by this Government.</p>

                        <p>11. Foreign Minister requests me to telegraph you that your intervention
                            has succeeded in modifying the attitude of his Government regarding the
                            National City Bank affair. Period for meeting fine expires tomorrow.
                            Since the Government considers that the banking regulations do not
                            provide for payment through a “termo de responsabilidade” and that form
                            of payment may not be possible, the Bank of Brazil will combine with the
                            National City Bank to make payment easy. Subsequent to payment the way
                            will be open for President Washington Luis to receive Hart and for full
                            discussion between bank and Government of the ultimate amount of
                            fine.</p>

                            their contentions. Conferred again with that office on March 31st.
                            Foreign Minister fully appreciates bank’s viewpoint which he is

                                xml:id="d527fn37">Not printed.</note> and in accordance with
                            information received from the Ministry of Finance, I have the honor to
                            hand Your Excellency the following explanations:</p>
                        <p>The exemption mentioned in Article 6 of Law No. 5,623, of December 29,
                            1928, shall be applied to all companies or associations established in
                            North America, which conduct the industry of navigation and have
                            agencies or branch offices in Brazil or exercise activities here, under
                            conditions of reciprocity for Brazilian navigation companies.</p>
                        <p>Under the express terms of the law, this privilege is restricted to these
                            companies and therefore does not include the income of North American
                            citizens, derived from the operation of one or more ships, registered
                            under the laws of their country.<note n="38" xml:id="d527fn38">By a
                                despatch dated March 31, 1930, the American Ambassador at Rio de
                                Janeiro informed the Secretary of State that he had been advised by
                                the Brazilian Foreign Office that shareholders in foreign companies
                                are required to pay the Brazilian income tax on their shares, the
                                amount of the tax being collected before the interest thereon is
                                paid them. This statement is construed by the Treasury Department to
                                mean that the Brazilian Government imposes a tax on the shareholders
                                of such corporations, but does not impose a tax on the income or
                                profits of such corporations derived from the operation of ships
                                documented under the laws of the United States. The Treasury
                                Department understands that such provision of the Brazilian law is
                                merely a method of collecting income tax at the source by means of
                                requiring the tax to be paid by the corporations before the
                                distribution of dividends on the shares of stock, which is similar
                                to the provision contained in American law requiring income tax to
                                be withheld at the source before the payment of bond interest or
                                other fixed or determinable income of nonresident aliens as provided
                                by section 144(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the Revenue Act of
                                1928.—Letter of the Secretary of the Treasury, July 28, 1930, to the
                                Secretary of State (811.512332 Shipping/16, 17).</note></p>
                        <p>Finally, I can inform Your Excellency that from December 29, 1928 onward,
                            no taxes were collected on income derived by navigation companies
                            operated by North American citizens or companies established in that
                            country.</p>

                        <p>The notice reads: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    parents. In adopting this attitude the Brazilian authorities are

                                    passports. They must enter and leave Brazil on Brazilian

                            462 of April 1, 1930, from this office, reporting the publication of a
                            notice concerning dual nationality of persons born in Brazil of British
                            parents, by H. B. M. Consuls-General in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo;
                            and calling attention to the possibility that the evident international
                            agreement on which such notices were founded might be invoked in the
                            case of persons born in Brazil of American parents.</p>
                        <p>The first case of this nature affecting American citizens in this
                            district has just arisen and has been adjusted as follows:</p>
                        <p>On April 8, 1930, Mr. Charles M. Pratt an American citizen formerly
                            registered in this office but now a permanent resident of New York on a
                            temporary visit to Rio de Janeiro, called at the Central Police Bureau
                            for the purpose of having the American passports of <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0561"/>himself and family visaed for journey
                            to the Argentine. The police, without question, visaed his passport and
                            the passports of his wife and one daughter who was born in the United
                            States. However, they refused to visa the Department passport of his
                            daughter Martha, who was born in Rio de Janeiro in February 1909. Miss
                            Pratt resided in the United States from 1911 to March, 1930
                            inclusive.</p>
                        <p>The Police informed Mr. Pratt that in accordance with Brazilian law his
                            daughter was a Brazilian and would have to travel on a Brazilian
                            passport. In order to avoid trouble, Mr. Pratt was disposed to comply
                            with this decision but before doing so came to the Consulate General, on
                            April 9, 1930, for advice. The Consul General advised Mr. Pratt to
                            refrain from obtaining a Brazilian passport for his daughter and
                            arranged for a call on the Chief of Police, with Mr. Pratt, for the
                            purpose of adjusting this matter. The Chief of Police was not in, but
                            the Secretario Geral, Dr. Cicero Machado, the official evidently
                            responsible for this order, was interviewed. Dr. Machado was told that
                            Miss Pratt was of age, the daughter of Americans, that her birth had
                            been recorded at the American Consulate, and that she had resided in the
                            United States practically all of her life. Dr. Machado stated that cases
                            had come to the attention of the Police where individuals born in Brazil
                            of foreign parents were travelling with two passports. (He referred to
                            so-called Anglo-Brazilians). Dr. Machado was informed that under no
                            circumstance would this office sanction such procedure and all cases of
                            this nature coming to our attention would be reported. Mr. Machado then
                            ordered that the visa for travel to the Argentine be placed on Miss
                            Pratt’s American passport without further impediment or delay.</p>

                            The Department is interested to learn the basis of the apparently new
                            policy of requiring Brazilians of dual nationality to use Brazilian
                            passports on leaving Brazil. It is desired that when taking up this
                            matter with the Brazilian authorities you point out that it has never
                            been the policy of this Government to require that a person having
                            American nationality and also the nationality of another country be in
                            possession of an American passport in order to depart from the United
                            States and it is desired that in all cases where persons having both
                            American and Brazilian nationality have indicated their preference to
                            travel on American passports they be permitted to depart from Brazil

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s instruction
                            N° 1541, of June 12 last, concerning the subject of dual nationality in
                            relation to United States citizens who are also considered to be
                            Brazilian citizens, I have the honor to report that the basis of the
                            policy requiring the use of Brazilian passports by the Brazilian-born
                            children of foreigners and Brazilian-born citizens married to citizens
                            of the United States previous to the recent alteration of our laws of
                            citizenship, is based upon Art. 69, 1. of the Brazilian Constitution,
                            which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Persons born in Brazil though of a foreign father, if the latter
                                    is not there resident in the service of his country, are
                                    Brazilian citizens.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is only recently, however, that the Brazilian police has attempted to
                            compel the persons above referred to to secure a police visa upon a
                            Brazilian passport and not upon a United States passport before leaving
                            this country for abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Foreign Office has instructed the Brazilian Ambassador <pb
                                n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0563"/>to confer with the Department
                            regarding a recognition of the status of the children born in Brazil of
                            American citizens, which children under the Brazilian Constitution are
                            Brazilian citizens, and also of Brazilian citizens married to United
                            States citizens before the recent change in our citizenship laws by
                            which nationality was not altered through marriage to such citizens.</p>
                        <p>Pending the solution of this matter, I recommend that American Consuls in
                            Brazil do not resort to the police authorities in order to obtain
                            permission from the local police for a person born in Brazil but bearing
                            an American passport to leave the country. It will be more satisfactory
                            and expeditious if such persons apply to the Embassy where, through
                            diplomatic channels, their cases can usually be arranged. The case of
                            Miss Mary A. Bevam, which the Consul General in Rio de Janeiro brought
                            to my attention on July 22, was settled as soon as I conferred with the
                            Foreign Office thereon.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to report also that I have called the attention of the
                            Brazilian Government to the fact that it has never been the policy of
                            the United States Government to require that a person having American
                            nationality and also the nationality of another country be in possession
                            of an American passport in order to depart from the United States and it
                            is desired that in all cases where persons having both American and
                            Brazilian nationality have indicated their preference to travel on
                            American passports they be permitted to depart from Brazil upon such
                            passports.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Several occasions have arisen in
                            which the Federal Government of Brazil have had to examine and discuss
                            the doubts of foreign Governments or of their diplomatic Missions
                            accredited in the country—the Mission of the United States of America
                            being included in the number—with regard to the viséing on passports of
                            persons of double nationality.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the
                            United States of Brazil, has received instructions from his Government
                            to bring to the knowledge of the United States Government the viewpoint
                            held by the Brazilian Government concerning passports issued to persons
                            of double nationality, whenever one of these is the Brazilian
                            nationality.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Government of Brazil recognize, as a fact, the double
                            nationality, inasmuch as it is within the rights of every Power to
                            freely establish, in conformity with its Constitution and laws, the
                            qualifications of the individuals whom it considers its own nationals.
                            It is in virtue of this precept that persons of double nationality,
                            whenever one of them is the Brazilian nationality, can only enter the
                            Brazilian national territory or absent themselves from it when they are
                            actual bearers of Brazilian passports, notwithstanding the fact that
                            this requirement does not preclude them from having passports issued by
                            other Powers that may also consider them as being their own
                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Government consider that these rules are the natural
                            sequence of the necessity of not entitling any persons, duly qualified
                            as Brazilian citizens, to claim protection, within the Brazilian
                            national territory, of any laws or authorities other than the Brazilian
                            laws and the Brazilian authorities.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned ventures to believe that in so far as the United States
                            Government are concerned in this matter, the proper directions may be
                            issued for the adjustment of the interests of bearers of American
                            passports whenever they happen to be also citizens of the United States
                            of Brazil.</p>

                            Embassy’s despatch No. 3387, of July 23, 1930, on the subject of dual
                            nationality in relation to the United States citizens who are also
                            considered by Brazilian law to be Brazilian citizens, and to transmit to
                            the Department the following information for its use in any discussions
                            which may be had with the Brazilian Ambassador in Washington.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy has had occasion to discuss with the Brazilian Foreign
                            Office the status of several American citizens who are also Brazilian
                            citizens, according to Brazilian law, and who prefer to leave Brazil
                            carrying an American passport rather than a Brazilian one. In some of
                            the first cases taken up officials of the Foreign Office intervened with
                            the police and obtained police visas on the American passports, thereby
                            permitting the departure of the bearers from Brazil. However, it was
                            stated that such a course would be considered exceptional and it has
                            been impossible to obtain action in the case of several minors. They
                            have presumably been forced to leave Brazil carrying an American
                            passport and a Brazilian one.</p>

                                respectively,<note n="1" xml:id="d538fn1">Neither printed.</note>
                            setting forth the views of Mr. Sydney Waterlow, the British Minister in
                            Sofia, regarding Bulgaria’s relations with neighboring Balkan States and
                            the steps which in his opinion are necessary in order to bring about a
                            diplomatic adjustment of Bulgaria’s troubles and a solution of the
                            problem of Balkan peace. The Department has noted Mr. Waterlow’s
                            proposal “to have all questions of dispute between Balkan countries
                            referred to France, Italy, Great Britain and the United States for
                            friendly settlement but that this can only be achieved by the Balkan
                            countries having the fullest confidence in the disinterestedness of the
                            motives of the more powerful nations.” Mr. Waterlow has accordingly
                            expressed the hope that you would be ready to be called upon at any time
                            to use your friendly influence “to uphold the sincerity” of the
                            intentions of himself and of his French and Italian colleagues in any
                            representations that they may make to the Bulgarian Government.</p>
                        <p>In reply to your request for an expression of the Department’s views as
                            to the proper course to be followed in case you receive an invitation
                            from your British colleague to participate in the “friendly advice”
                            which he and his other colleagues may decide to give to the Bulgarian
                            Government, the Department desires that you scrupulously refrain from
                            associating yourself with your colleagues in making representations or
                            giving advice of any kind to the Bulgarian Government regarding its
                            domestic affairs or relations with European States unless you have been
                            specifically authorized to do so by the Department.</p>

                        <p>By the foregoing the Department does not intend that you should refrain
                            from giving free expression on any appropriate occasion to this
                            country’s profound interest in the development of a better understanding
                            among nations and in the maintenance of world peace by all appropriate
                            means. Bearing this in mind, you will of course keep the Department
                            promptly and fully informed, if necessary by telegraph, of any situation
                            affecting Bulgaria of sufficient gravity to warrant, in the opinion of
                            your colleagues, representations on their part to the Bulgarian
                            Government. The Department will in such cases instruct you as to the
                            action, if any, which it desires you to take.</p>

                                Phillips’ note No. 349 of April 20, 1929,<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d539fn3">Not printed.</note> with regard to measures
                                under consideration for the further control of smuggling operations
                                along the border between Canada and the United States, and
                                particularly to Mr. Phillips’ statement that the Government of the
                                United States was convinced that the only effective means of dealing
                                with the smuggling problem along the border would be the conclusion
                                of a treaty amending the Convention <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489"
                                    facs="0569"/>of June 6, 1924, to the end that clearance be
                                denied to shipments of commodities from either country when their
                                importation is prohibited in the other.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian Government has been giving further consideration to the
                                question in the light of experience in Canada as well as of
                                developments in border enforcement by the authorities of the United
                                States, and has reached the conclusion that further action is
                                desirable as regards both the special problem of the smuggling of
                                intoxicating liquors and the general problem of commercial
                                smuggling.</p>
                            <p>As to the export of intoxicating liquors from Canada, which involves
                                the use of governmental agencies in the release of liquors from bond
                                as well as in the issue of clearances, it has been considered
                                advisable that action should be taken forthwith by Dominion
                                legislation. A bill has accordingly been introduced into the House
                                of Commons to amend the Export Act, the main purpose of the
                                amendment being to require officials of the Dominion Government
                                having charge of liquor in bond and the granting of clearances to
                                vessels to refuse to release such liquor or to grant such clearances
                                where the granting of such release or clearance in any case would
                                facilitate the introduction of intoxicating liquor into a country
                                where the importation of such liquor is forbidden by law. This
                                measure has received second reading in the House of Commons and is
                                now being considered in detail in committee. It will be observed
                                from the copy of the bill which I enclose that it is general in its
                                terms, applying to export to any country where the importation of
                                intoxicating liquor is forbidden by law.</p>
                            <p>As to the general problem, it will be recalled that in discussing the
                                holding of a conference to consider the various proposals put
                                forward for further action to ensure the prevention of smuggling,
                                the Canadian Government indicated, in February, 1927, its desire
                                that the discussion should not be confined to the question of the
                                smuggling of liquor but should cover all forms of commercial
                                smuggling from each country into the other. The Canadian Government
                                believes that the present would be an opportune time to conclude
                                with the United States a treaty as suggested amending the Convention
                                of June 6, 1924, to provide on a reciprocal basis for the denial of
                                clearance of shipments of merchandise by water, air, or land from
                                either country to the other when their importation is prohibited by
                                the latter, and for such further reciprocal measures for the
                                suppression of smuggling as may be found feasible.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian Government would therefore be prepared to take the
                                necessary steps at an early date for the conclusion of such a
                                convention.</p>

                                printed.</note> Prime Minister who leaves tomorrow for Bermuda how
                            believes conference impractical at present since Easter recess of
                            Parliament begins tomorrow. Several Cabinet Ministers including Minister
                            of National Revenue will be absent until April 28 when House of Commons
                            reconvenes. He suggests meanwhile that drafts of treaty be exchanged as
                            between Legation and Department of External Affairs with a view to
                            determining more definitely whether differences are sufficient to
                            necessitate proposed conference. Under Secretary of State for External
                            Affairs hopes to have Canadian draft ready around April 16 and suggests
                            that if American draft were available by that time we might examine the
                            two drafts and exchange preliminary impressions before submitting them
                            to the respective Governments for examination. Decision as to conference
                            could then follow. He also desires to know whether it would be
                            convenient to have signature of treaty take place at Ottawa since this
                            would facilitate procedure for Canadian Government. If American
                            Government consents he proposes to apply to London for full power for
                            Prime Minister to sign treaty.</p>

                            April 29, 1930,<note n="7" xml:id="d544fn7">Not printed.</note> covering
                            the remarks made by the Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs
                            regarding the draft of a proposed convention to supplement the
                            Anti-Smuggling Convention between Canada and the United States of June
                            6, 1924, I have the honor to transmit herewith an outline of the counter
                            proposals advanced on behalf of Canada in the course of a two hour
                            discussion which took place between Dr. Skelton, Mr. Beaudry and myself
                            yesterday afternoon at the Department of External Affairs. References by
                            line and page will be made in this despatch to the draft transmitted
                            with the Department’s instruction No. 819 of April 16, 1930, (file No.
                            711.429/263a). Line numeration will begin with No. 1 for the first line
                            of each section of the Convention, namely, the Preamble and each of the
                            various Articles, so that each one will have its own line
                            numeration.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Preamble</hi></p>
                        <p>In line 2 of the Preamble, in the expression “the British dominions
                            beyond the Seas” the Canadian Government desires to write the word
                            “dominions” with a small “d”. The reason given is that in the King’s
                            title the word “dominions” refers to the whole of the King’s domain and
                            was in use before Canada came into existence. It is therefore desired to
                            draw by this means a distinction between the King’s dominions and the
                            various Dominions which are members of the British Commonwealth of
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, after the expression “Emperor of India” in line 3, it is
                            desired to insert “in respect of the Dominion of Canada” in order to
                            conform with present Canadian treaty practice.</p>
                        <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0575"/>
                        <p>After the expression “desirous of” in line 3 the Canadian Government
                            desires to change the language of the Preamble to the following:
                            “supplementing the provisions of the Convention of June 6, 1924, between
                            Canada and the United States of America, for the suppression of
                            smuggling operations along the border,” to replace the language in the
                            American draft from the point indicated above down to and including the
                            date “June 6, 1924” in line 8 of the Preamble. The Canadians do not like
                            the expression “more effective … than” occurring in the American
                            Preamble, since they feel that it makes an invidious comparison between
                            the proposed Convention and that of 1924, by suggesting that the latter
                            was ineffective. Although it was not actually stated, I believe that the
                            substitution of the expression “along the border” instead of “between
                            the territories” is preferred by the Canadians to avoid any suggestion
                            that the Convention could be construed to cover indirect smuggling via a
                            base on the territory of a third party.</p>
                        <p>In line 9 it is desired to insert after the word “concerning” the
                            expression “the transportation of”, since the Canadians desire to
                            emphasize that that is the particular phase of the question covered by
                            the Convention. They also prefer the word “additional” instead of the
                            word “supplementary” in line 10.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article I</hi></p>
                        <p>In line 3 the Canadians point out that the expression “High Contracting
                            Parties” in so far as it refers to the Canadian side, refers to the
                            King. They therefore prefer to refer to “the ports of the Dominion of
                            Canada or of the United States of America” and to eliminate the word
                            “territory” in this Article. They state that “territory” as used in the
                            American draft must inevitably refer to the King’s territory and that
                            unfriendly critics and legalistic opponents might raise the contention
                            that by using such phraseology the Dominion was unconsciously passing
                            legislation which could be construed as affecting portions of the King’s
                            territory other than the Dominion of Canada. They also desire this
                            change since they claim it to be a reversion to the original American
                            draft presented to them in 1925.</p>
                        <p>After the expression “denied if” in line 5, the Canadians desire to
                            change the rest of Article I as shown in their enclosed draft. I gather
                            that they do not wish to undertake the responsibility of having to
                            guarantee the absence of prohibited articles in an apparently regular
                            and bona fide shipment of merchandise. This is in line with the replies
                            made in Parliament in the course of the discussion of the Liquor Export
                            Bill and the proposed Convention. They therefore prefer the expression
                            “shipment of merchandise” instead of “shipment comprises articles the
                            introduction of which is prohibited.”</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0576"/>
                        <p>They also desire the elimination of the word “restricted”. Dr. Skelton
                            stated that his understanding was that the word “restricted” had been
                            inserted to cover goods such as narcotics and sacramental wines which
                            are normally articles of prohibited importation, but which may, under
                            certain conditions and for certain purposes, be imported under special
                            Government permit. The Canadian authorities fear that the word
                            “restricted” could be construed to cover articles which are subject to
                            tariff restrictions, such as countervailing duties, et cetera, and they
                            prefer that there should be no ambiguity. Consequently, in the Canadian
                            counter draft, lines 8, 9 and 10 also disappear.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that they also desire to include in the Convention
                            under Article I mention of lists of articles of prohibited importation
                            in both countries, to be changed from time to time by communication
                            between the two Governments. They have also inserted in this Article a
                            paragraph incorporating in the Convention a provision covering the
                            prohibited admission of articles included under Item 1201 of the
                            Canadian Customs Tariff, namely, “books, printed paper, drawings,
                            paintings, prints, photographs or representations of any kind of a
                            treasonable or seditious, or of an immoral or indecent character”. This
                            is an effort to meet the difficulty explained by Dr. Skelton as related
                            in my despatch No. 1388 above mentioned.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article II</hi></p>
                        <p>In line 2 it is desired to restore the word “attached” instead of
                            “attach” in order to conform with the language of Article VII of the
                            Convention of 1924. Likewise and for the same reason it is desired to
                            eliminate “from one place in Canada to another place in that country” in
                            line 5 and to substitute “under guard by Canadian authorities” instead
                            of “under such guard as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United
                            States of America may require” in lines 6 and 7. There is also a slight
                            change in the language of lines 9 and 10, which does not, however,
                            apparently affect the sense and is considered better phraseology by the
                            Canadian side. They also contend that the “c” should be eliminated from
                            the spelling of the name “Stikine” in line 9.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article III</hi></p>
                        <p>In line 2 it is desired to substitute the word “attached” instead of
                            “attach” as explained above under Article II. In lines 4 and 5, the
                            Canadians desire the substitution of “under guard by Canadian
                            authorities” instead of “under such guard as the Secretary of the
                            Treasury of the United States of America may require”, for the reasons
                            explained above in Article II.</p>
                        <p>In lines 6 and 7, it is desired to eliminate “between Montreal, Quebec,
                            and St. John, New Brunswick”, and to substitute therefor “from Canadian
                            territory to Canadian territory” since Dr. Skelton stated that Montreal
                            is not the only possible point of destination and that <pb n="497"
                                xml:id="pg_497" facs="0577"/>shipments might also be made to such
                            points, for instance, as Sherbrooke or the city of Quebec. He also
                            desires to eliminate in lines 9 and 10 the phrase “such liquor to be
                            destined only for the Liquor Control Boards of the several Provinces of
                            Canada”. He pointed out that this is an internal Canadian matter and
                            that difficulties might arise in connection with the Convention if, for
                            instance, one or more of the Provinces were to abolish Government
                            control. He also pointed out that the expression “Liquor Control Board”
                            does not apply in every Province, since in Quebec, for instance, these
                            authorities are officially termed “Liquor Commissions.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. Skelton also asked me whether there is any reason for the discrepancy
                            between the expression “under seal” in lines 13 and 14 of Article II and
                            “under Canadian and United States customs seals” in lines 8 and 9 of
                            Article III. His rough draft had eliminated this expression entirely. I
                            pointed out that there might well be some good administrative reason for
                            this provision in Article III due to a possible difference in the
                            activities of smugglers and “hijackers” in the State of Maine. He told
                            me that he would be willing to allow it to stand in the Convention if it
                            were considered essential but he requested that I ask for an explanation
                            of the discrepancy between the reference to seals in Articles II and
                            III.</p>
                        <p>The Canadians desire to eliminate the whole of the last sentence of
                            Article III comprising lines 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22. Dr. Skelton says
                            that the matter of payment by the Canadian Pacific Railway is understood
                            as a matter of course and that the Government does not see the necessity
                            for mention of it in the Convention.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article IV</hi></p>
                        <p>In lines 9 and 10, after the word “given” the Canadians desire to
                            substitute the words “notice to the other of a desire to terminate the
                            Convention” instead of “such notice to the other party.” This change is
                            preferred in order to revert to the phraseology of Article VIII of the
                            Convention of 1924, and is in conformity with the disposition manifested
                            by Dr. Skelton and Mr. Beaudry throughout the discussion of yesterday
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>I desire to apologize to the Department for not preparing a draft text
                            with suitable lining and underlining, showing at a glance the
                            alterations proposed in the Canadian counterdraft; the necessity to get
                            this draft off at the earliest mail has rendered the preparation of such
                            a text impossible.</p>
                        <p>I am also advised by Dr. Skelton that the Prime Minister has received
                            from London the full power necessary for the signature of this
                            Convention and is disposed to sign it as soon as agreement can be
                            reached as to the text.</p>

                                between Canada and the United States of America, for the suppression

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Legation’s despatch
                            No. 1428 of May 22, 1930, transmitting the Canadian counter-proposals
                            with respect to the proposed convention to supplement the anti-smuggling
                            convention between the United States and Canada of June 6, 1924, the
                            Department informs you that the Canadian counter-proposals have been
                            given thorough consideration in collaboration with the Treasury
                            Department and the Department of Justice. The following comment is
                            arranged, in accordance with the system employed in the Legation’s
                            despatch:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Preamble</hi></p>
                        <p>This Government accepts the Canadian draft as far as the phrase “along
                            the border” in lines 7 and 8. Since there may be smuggling elsewhere
                            than along the border, as, for example, by air shipments destined for
                            points in the interior, this phrase should be eliminated, unless, for
                            some reason not known to the Department, Canada strongly desires it. In
                            the latter case, this Government may reconsider its position. The
                            remainder of the preamble of the Canadian draft is acceptable to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article I</hi></p>
                        <p>It is desired that lines 1 to 5 of this article be worded as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The High Contracting Parties agree that clearance of shipments of
                                    merchandise by water, air or land <hi rend="italic">from any of
                                        the ports of the Dominion of Canada or of the United States
                                        of America to any port or place in the other shall</hi> be
                                    denied, etc.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is deemed advisable that clearance should be denied to any prohibited
                            article whether destined to a place that is technically a port <pb
                                n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0581"/>or to any other place in the
                            United States or the Dominion of Canada, respectively. It is recognized,
                            however, that the point is not likely to be of practical significance
                            and, if the Canadian Government indicates a strong preference for the
                            language used in the draft which it submitted, you are authorized to
                            agree thereto.</p>
                        <p>After careful consideration, the Department believes that it will be
                            impracticable to attach to the convention schedules setting forth lists
                            of the articles the importation of which is prohibited. Such lists, it
                            would seem, should be communicated between the Governments at the time
                            of the exchange of ratifications and thereafter changes may be
                            communicated as in third paragraph of Article I of the Canadian draft.
                            Accordingly, it is desired that the second and third paragraphs of
                            Article I of the Canadian draft be omitted and the following language
                            inserted in their place: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Lists of articles the importation of which is prohibited in the
                                    Dominion of Canada and the United States of America,
                                    respectively, shall be exchanged between the two Governments
                                    immediately after the exchange of ratifications.</p>
                                <p>The Government of either country may, from time to time,
                                    communicate to the other any changes made in its list.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>All of the other counter-proposals relating to Article I are acceptable
                            to this Government.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article II</hi></p>
                        <p>This Government is prepared to accept all Canadian counter-proposals in
                            regard to Article II. The Department is informed that there is no
                            requirement for a United States customs seal in the Panama Canal Zone
                            because that territory is solely under the jurisdiction of the War
                            Department and the customs authorities exercise no jurisdiction there.
                            The customs authorities are understood not to be in a position actually
                            to maintain agents to protect American customs seals on shipments in
                            transit via the River Stikine.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article III</hi></p>
                        <p>With reference to line 5 of the Canadian counter-draft in which the
                            phrase “under guard by Canadian authorities” has been substituted for
                            “under such guard as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States
                            may require”, you are informed that, while there is little likelihood
                            that this Government will care to have American guards on Canadian
                            trains in transit through Maine, it desires to provide for the exercise
                            of such right at its option. The United States customs seals may be
                            tampered with or forged, or other circumstances may arise which would
                            make it desirable to have American as well as Canadian guards on these
                            trains. In view of the statement referred to on page 7 of the Legation’s
                            despatch No. 1428, it is assumed that the Canadian Pacific Railway would
                            furnish free transportation for <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0582"
                            />United States customs guards on its trains, in the event this
                            Government should desire to employ them.</p>
                        <p>You are, accordingly, requested to propose the insertion of the words
                            “and/or authorities of the United States of America” after the phrase
                            “under guard by Canadian authorities” in line 5, and to say that all
                            other changes in Article III are acceptable to this Government. If it
                            should prove to be impracticable to obtain the foregoing amendment to
                            the Canadian draft without materially delaying the conclusion of the
                            convention, you are authorized to withdraw the proposal.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Article IV</hi></p>
                        <p>All changes are acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Full powers to sign the treaty on behalf of the United States will be
                            transmitted in an early pouch.</p>

                            the Canadian Government further proposals and suggestions based on
                            consideration of the Canadian counter-proposals of May 22, 1930,<note

                            convention between the United States and Canada of June 6, 1924. The
                            American reply to the Canadian counterproposals, embodied in the shape
                            of a note, was presented to the Canadian Department of External Affairs
                            on the first instant.</p>
                        <p>When discussing the matter informally, Dr. Skelton the Under–Secretary of
                            State for External Affairs who is now absent on leave, stated that it
                            would not be possible to reply to this note until Mr. Bennett<note

                            from the Imperial Conference in London and given the suggested changes
                            his consideration. He said that, moreover, account must be taken of the
                            possibility that the present Government may not see eye to eye with the
                            late Liberal government <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0583"/>in the
                            matter of such parts of the draft as have already been approved in
                            negotiation; he did not, however, mean that he actually knew of such a
                            difference in views since, apparently, the new Government has had no
                            opportunity to examine into the matter. No oral discussion was attempted
                            as regards the changes proposed in the Department’s instruction under
                            acknowledgment, since Dr. Skelton stated that these changes would have
                            to be studied by other interested Government departments before the
                            stage of oral discussion or reply could be reached.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s instructions with regard to the possible withdrawal of
                            the suggestions for changes in lines 1 to 5 of Article I and line 5 of
                            Article III, have been noted, and should stubborn opposition be
                            encountered, the suggestions will be withdrawn. Needless to say, no
                            mention of this possibility has been made in the note to the Canadian
                            Government, but in response to a suggestion from the Legation, the
                            Department of External Affairs has agreed to have an oral discussion
                            before transmitting the final reply, should any of the desired changes
                            prove definitely inacceptable.</p>

                            body to its ratification, if his judgment approve thereof, a convention
                            between the United States of America and His Majesty the King of Great
                            Britain, Ireland and the British dominions beyond the seas, Emperor of
                            India, in respect of the Dominion of Canada, for the protection,

                        <p>This convention is in substitution of the convention for the protection,
                            preservation and extension of the sockeye salmon fisheries of the Fraser
                            River system, signed by the Secretary of State and the Minister of

                            on April 18, 1929, and was returned by the Senate to the President by
                            Resolution of December 13, 1929.</p>
                        <p>The necessity for the revision of the 1929 convention was seen in the
                            fact that during the summer of 1929, subsequent to its signature,
                            fishermen, for the first time, took large quantities of sockeye salmon
                            in the Pacific Ocean beyond territorial waters of the United States and
                            Canada. It became apparent from the success of that fishery that the
                            sockeye salmon fisheries in the Fraser River, Georgia Strait, Juan de
                            Fuca Strait and contiguous waters cannot be adequately protected and
                            developed unless the fishery on the high seas is controlled. There are
                            included, therefore, in the waters covered by the new convention, the
                            territorial waters off the western coasts of the United States and
                            Canada between the 48th and 49th parallels of north latitude, and
                            likewise the high seas of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to these
                            territorial waters between the same parallels, in addition to the Fraser
                            River and the boundary waters between the United States and Canada which
                            were embraced in the convention signed in 1929.</p>
                        <p>The authority which the convention gives to the International Pacific
                            Salmon Fisheries Commission to limit or prohibit fishing on the high
                            seas and to prescribe the size of the mesh of gear that may be used on
                            the high seas is, of course, applicable to nationals and inhabitants <pb
                                n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0585"/>and vessels and boats of the
                            United States and of Canada only, as are the provisions of the
                            convention in regard to the arrest and detention of violators of the
                            prohibition against fishing on the high seas covered by Article IX of
                            the convention.</p>
                        <p>Other points of difference between the convention signed on March 27,
                            1929, and the present convention are that there is omitted from the
                            latter the provision that the Commissioner of Fisheries of the United
                            States shall be one of the members of the Commission; that it is
                            specifically provided by the new convention that the commissioners
                            appointed by each of the High Contracting Parties shall hold office
                            during the pleasure of the Contracting Party by which they were
                            appointed; and that instead of the limitation by dates of the period of
                            the year within which the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries
                            Commission might limit or prohibit fishing, which was provided in
                            Article IV of the convention signed on March 27, 1929, the new
                            convention contains a provision under which the Commission is at liberty
                            to limit or prohibit the fishing in the waters of the United States,
                            Canada and the high seas, respectively, for such periods as may be
                            required by the particular conditions of each year. The greater
                            flexibility in regulation thus provided, as well as the extension of
                            authority of the Commission to regulate fishing for sockeye salmon by
                            American and Canadian fishermen and fishing vessels on the high seas,
                            will enable the Commission to so regulate the fisheries that there will
                            be, as nearly as possible, an equal division of the catch between the
                            fishermen of the United States and Canada.</p>
                        <p>By Article V of the convention now submitted the Commission is given
                            authority to regulate the size of meshes in salmon fishing gear used on
                            the high seas by American and Canadian fishermen and fishing vessels at
                            any season of the year, in addition to the authority given to the
                            Commission in the Convention of 1929 to regulate the size of meshes in
                            fishing gear used in national waters of the two countries during the
                            spring or Chinook salmon fishing season.</p>

                            spawning ground conditions and other related matters. It shall conduct

                            determine to be necessary for the propagation of sockeye salmon in any
                            of the waters covered by this Convention, and to stock any such waters
                            with sockeye salmon by such methods as it may determine to be most
                            advisable. The Commission shall also have authority to recommend to the
                            Governments of the High Contracting Parties removing or otherwise
                            overcoming obstructions to the ascent of sockeye salmon, that may now

                            action to overcome obstructions to be desirable. The Commission shall
                            make an annual report to the two Governments as to the investigations
                            which it has made and other action which it has taken in execution of

                            overcoming obstructions that may be approved, shall be borne equally by
                            the two Governments, and the said Governments agree to appropriate
                            annually such money as each may deem desirable for such work in the

                            Government as a counterproposal to the draft which the Legation
                            submitted to that Government pursuant to instruction No. 548 of May 29,

                        <p>Note has been made of the criticism made by the Canadian Government in
                            its note No. 128 of October 3, 1929,<note n="19" xml:id="d551fn19">Not

                            presented by this Government, and of the alterations made in that
                            paragraph by the draft forwarded to the Department with the Legation’s
                            despatch of October 7, 1929. As will be indicated hereinafter in detail,
                            this Government is prepared to accept, with the insertion of two phrases
                            and two verbal changes, the paragraph as revised by the Canadian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>On a comparison of the Canadian draft enclosed with the Legation’s
                            despatch and the draft transmitted to the Legation with instruction No.
                            548 of May 29, 1929, changes made by the Canadian Government have been
                            noted in the Preamble and in Articles II, III and V. References made in
                            this instruction to line number are to the draft received from the
                            Canadian Government in October, 1929, and in many cases do not
                            correspond exactly with the line number in the revised draft herewith
                                enclosed.<note n="19a" xml:id="d551fn19a">Revised draft convention

                        <p>The Preamble of the draft submitted by Canada is acceptable to this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The word “mutually”, appearing in the expression “as may be mutually
                            agreed upon” in Article II in the American draft, was omitted from the
                            Canadian draft. This omission is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The expression “convention between His Britannic Majesty and the United
                            States” in the first paragraph of Article III and in Article V of this
                            Government’s draft was amended in the Canadian draft to read “convention
                            between His Britannic Majesty and the President of the United States”.
                            This Government does not agree to the insertion of the words “the
                            President of” in this expression at these places. The expression used in
                            the Halibut Convention concluded March 2, 1923,<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d551fn20"><ref target="frus1923v01#pg_468"><hi rend="italic"

                                        >i</hi>, p. 468</ref>.</note> to which reference is made at
                            these two places in the convention under negotiation, is “the United
                            States” and not “the President of the United States”. In the view of
                            this Government the same expression, namely, “the United States”, should
                            be used in the reference in the present Convention. The term “the
                            President of the United States of America” at the other places where the
                            expression “the President of the United States” or “the President of the
                            United States of America” appears in the Canadian draft is acceptable to
                            this Government.</p>
                        <p>Other differences between the two drafts appear to be confined to Article
                            III. The differences noted in detail are as follows:</p>
                        <p>The expression “Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea” was substituted at
                            one place in the first paragraph and one place in the second paragraph
                            for the expression “Northern Pacific Ocean including Bering Sea”.
                            Inasmuch as that expression as used in the first paragraph is a
                            reference to the description in the Convention of 1923, it is believed
                            that the word “including” should be restored at this place, as it is
                            used in the Convention of 1923. “Including” was retained, quite properly
                            in the view of this Government, in the second paragraph of Article V of
                            the Canadian draft of the new Convention. This Government has no
                            objection to the use of the word “and” in the same expression in the
                            second paragraph of Article III and in the Preamble of the new
                            Convention, as it appears in the Canadian draft.</p>
                        <p>The provision “and this Commission shall publish a report of its
                            activities from time to time” also in the first paragraph of Article III
                            was amended in the Canadian draft to read “which Commission shall make
                            such investigations as are necessary into the life history of the
                            halibut in the treaty waters and shall publish a report of its
                            activities from time to time”. The revision is acceptable to this
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>In provision (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the words “statistics of the
                            catch of halibut” were substituted for the words “statistics of the
                            catch”; the words “as will enable the International Fisheries
                            Commission” were substituted for the words “as will enable the
                            Commission”; and the words “trend of the halibut fishery” were
                            substituted for the words “trend of the fishery”.</p>
                        <p>This amended statement, with the substitution of the word “convention”
                            for “treaty” in subdivision (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) as hereinafter
                            proposed, is acceptable to this Government.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed to make the following proposals for the revision of
                            the Canadian draft of the Convention:</p>
                        <p>(1) that the words “including Bering Sea” in the seventh line of the
                            first paragraph of Article I be replaced by the expression “including
                            the southern as well as the western coasts of Alaska”. The Pacific Ocean
                            is not mentioned in this paragraph. Reference to the coasts of Alaska,
                            for the purpose of including the waters of Bering Sea, is analogous to
                            the description of the waters of the Pacific Ocean by reference to the
                            coasts of the United States of America and of Canada. The new expression
                            proposed by this Government embraces all the waters intended to be
                            covered by the expression “including Bering Sea”. It is believed also
                            that it is well to include expressly the waters off the southern coast
                            of Alaska, which otherwise would only be embraced by inference in the
                            waters off the western coasts of the United States and of Canada.</p>
                        <p>(2) This Government is of the opinion that it should be clearly expressed
                            in the Convention that the authority which will be conferred on the
                            Commission by the second paragraph of Article III is limited in its
                            application to nationals and inhabitants and fishing vessels and boats
                            of the United States of America and of the Dominion of Canada. It,
                            therefore, proposes that there be inserted after the word “may” at the
                            end of the sixth line of the paragraph the words “in respect of the

                            States of America and of the Dominion of Canada”.</p>
                        <p>(3) The expression “from time to time” in the sixth line of the second
                            paragraph of Article III in the draft transmitted to the Legation with
                            the Department’s instruction No. 548 of May 29, 1929, does not appear in
                            this paragraph as revised in the Canadian draft. In the view of this
                            Government the expression should be restored, and <pb n="516"
                                xml:id="pg_516" facs="0596"/>should be placed after the insertion
                            proposed in the foregoing paragraph of this instruction.</p>
                        <p>The insertions proposed under items (2) and (3) read together are as
                            follows: “in respect of the nationals and inhabitants and fishing
                            vessels and boats of the United States of America and of the Dominion of
                            Canada, from time to time”. This clause will immediately precede the

                            instruction No. 793 of March 6, 1930, (file No. 711.428/1329), directing
                            me to submit to the Canadian Government an amended draft of the Halibut
                            Convention, together with the Department’s observations regarding
                            suggested changes, I have the honor to transmit herewith copy of the
                            Canadian Government’s reply received today.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Canadian Government is prepared to accept the
                            draft transmitted in the Department’s instruction under reference, with
                            two very minor changes. The expression “the United States
                            counter-draft”, quoted in the Canadian reply, was used by me in the note
                            to the Department of External Affairs, together with two other similar
                            expressions, for convenience in reference and to avoid the tedious
                            circumlocution which would otherwise have been necessary whenever one of
                            the three drafts under discussion was mentioned.</p>
                        <p>I understand informally that the Canadian request to London for the full
                            power to sign this Convention was despatched some time ago and that the
                            full power is consequently expected very shortly.</p>

                                Canadian Government, subject to the two following alterations in the

                                of Canada” after the words “His Majesty the King of Great Britain,
                                Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of
                                India”, for the purpose of reverting to a formula which had been in
                                use in recent years, and (2) a change in the punctuation relating to
                                the following words “and His Majesty: for the Dominion of Canada:”
                                so as to read “and His Majesty, for the Dominion of Canada:”.</p>

                            the case was argued in October. The answers of the Court were given on
                            February 5th. 1929. Some of the points at issue were clarified, but the
                            Court found itself unable to give conclusive answers to a number of the
                            more important questions.</p>

                            concluded that it would not be advisable at present to seek a solution
                            of the question of federal and provincial jurisdiction by further
                            reference to the courts. It has therefore invited the two governments of
                            the provinces of Ontario and Quebec to take part in a conference on the
                            problem of the St. Lawrence development, to be held as soon as possible
                            after the close of the present parliamentary session, at which it is
                            hoped it will be possible to reach a solution by direct agreement.</p>

                                >1928</hi>] to the necessity of reconciling the divergent views as

                            the St. Lawrence. The Ontario Government has now agreed to co-operate in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I do not know, of
                            course, what attitude you wish me to adopt in regard to the St. Lawrence
                            waterway project, but in the absence of instructions I am continuing to
                            urge the Canadian Government to agree to the appointment of
                            commissioners at the earliest possible date. You will recollect that Mr.
                            Kellogg’s note to the Dominion Government, dated March 12, 1928,<note
                                n="25" xml:id="d557fn25"><ref target="frus1928v02#pg_71"><hi

                            the two countries should proceed with the appointment of commissioners
                            to discuss jointly the various problems with a view to the formulation
                            of a convention appropriate to the whole subject. Ever since the receipt
                            of this communication I have been trying to get the Canadian Government
                            to agree to such a discussion, but up till now without much success.
                            However, I have had a further talk with the Prime Minister this morning
                            and am beginning to be really hopeful. He tells me that after the
                            adjournment of the present session of Parliament some time during the
                            middle or end of May, he has called a meeting of the Premiers of Quebec
                            and Ontario to talk over the whole problem arising out of the ownership
                            of power to be developed from navigable waters. A favorable reply to his
                            invitation has already been received from Mr. Taschereau, and Mr.
                            Ferguson of Ontario is also understood to have agreed to attend the
                            meeting. The Prime Minister is confident that he can settle to the
                            satisfaction of the people of both Quebec and Ontario the disposition of
                            their respective portions of the power, and that the moment this point
                            is settled he believes the two Provinces will raise no further objection
                            to proceeding with the discussion of the navigation problems.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry as to whether he would be in a position to agree
                            to the appointment of Canadian commissioners shortly after the
                            adjournment of the proposed conference, he intimated that he hoped he
                            would be able to do so. He will not commit himself any further in the
                            absence of precise information as to what our Congress proposes to do in
                            tariff matters.</p>
                        <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0604"/>
                        <p>I hope I am doing right in continuing to follow Mr. Kellogg’s wishes in
                            this matter, but I am counting upon you to let me know if I am not
                            acting in accordance with your views.</p>

                            that you should continue urging the appointment of Commissioners to
                            discuss jointly plans appropriate to the whole subject. While the
                            uncertainty of the action of our own Congress in reference to tariff
                            matters will play an important part in the success of your efforts in
                            that direction, still one of the best answers to the advocates of a
                            higher tariff on Canadian products would be a cheap means of water
                            transportation for our own farm and other products to the larger markets

                            Department in my telegram No. 182, dated September 19, 1929,<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d559fn1">Not printed.</note> that the forthcoming conference
                            between the Prime Minister and the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec
                            regarding power developement on the St. Lawrence would probably be
                            postponed until November, and in a telegram No. 181 of the same
                                date<note n="26" xml:id="d559fn2">Not printed.</note> that the
                            Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs had inquired as to whether
                            the United States would allow the Canadian Government to undertake the
                            channel improvements from Lake Ontario to Prescott on both sides of the
                            frontier on the understanding that the United States would reimburse
                            Canada at some future time for expenses incurred in the American
                            channels. These two subjects are in my opinion closely interwoven and
                            should therefore be given simultaneous consideration.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I beg to enclose a copy of a memorandum on the Great
                            Lakes–St. Lawrence seaway which has been forwarded to me <pb n="525"
                                xml:id="pg_525" facs="0605"/>by Mr. Charles P. Craig, Executive
                            Director of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Tidewater Association, under
                            date of September 9th,<note n="27" xml:id="d559fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            which deals with the Thousand Islands section, or in other words, with
                            that section of the river to which the Under-Secretary of State referred
                            in his conversation of September 19th. As the Department will note, Mr.
                            Craig is strongly of the opinion that the United States should join with
                            Canada in improving that portion of the American channels lying within
                            the Thousand Islands district. He believes that inasmuch as the whole
                            St. Lawrence waterway project is being undertaken by Canada in a
                            piecemeal fashion, through the completion of the Welland Canal in
                            Ontario and through the concession plan in Quebec, as revealed by the
                            recent Beauharnois concession, the Government of the United States
                            should not place itself in the position of refusing to cooperate with
                            Canada in developing a portion of the international section of the
                            river. He presents an argument which I believe the Department will wish
                            to study with care.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it may perhaps be helpful to consider another aspect of
                            the matter. The city of Prescott has excellent railway communication
                            with Montreal. Ogdensburg which is immediately across the river on the
                            American side, has very inadequate rail connection with the trunk lines
                            in New York State. It is the declared purpose of the Canadian Government
                            to develop the port of Prescott, and for this purpose large sums of
                            money have been appropriated during the last session of Parliament.
                            Elevators are to be erected for the storage of grain and large piers are
                            to be constructed for the accommodation of Lake vessels and for the
                            transfer of grain. In other words, it is the desire of the Canadian
                            Government that upon the opening of the Welland Canal in 1930 the
                            grain-carrying ships on the Lake will be enabled to proceed through Lake
                            Ontario and as far down the river as Prescott, discharging their cargoes
                            at this point for Montreal and other points east. The only difficulty to
                            this conception lies in the fact that the river channels between Lake
                            Ontario and Prescott-Ogdensburg are situated half in Canada and half in
                            the United States; but such importance is attached to Prescott that
                            Canada herself is willing to develop the American channels if the United
                            States Government is not now prepared to do so. Prescott and not
                            Ogdensburg is to be the great station for the transfer of grain from
                            ships to canal boats or to the railways, and Ogdensburg is to remain,
                            apparently, a mere ferry terminus for the transportation of passengers
                            to and from Prescott.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recollect that in my confidential despatch No. 464 of
                            June 7, 1928,<note n="27" xml:id="d559fn4">Not printed.</note> I
                            reported a conversation with the Under-Secretary <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0606"/>of State for External Affairs which was
                            to the effect that the “deepening of the channels in question between
                            Lake Ontario and Prescott-Ogdensburg was not designed as a step in the
                            broader development plan; that it could not be so, since the Canadian
                            Government had not as yet committed itself to embark upon the
                            development of the whole St. Lawrence”. Dr. Skelton advised me that it
                            was in fact “the outcome of the debates which had been going on ever
                            since the work had begun on the Welland Canal, and that it was,
                            therefore, related directly to the Welland Canal”.</p>
                        <p>It seems natural, therefore, that the United States would have no
                            especial interest in the development of channels in the international
                            section of the river which are declared by Canada herself to have no
                            relation to the larger project of navigation and which, moreover, may
                            deprive American ports such as Buffalo of a large part of their
                            transport trade. When Prescott becomes the terminus for Great Lakes
                            transportation, new and powerful influences will be at work to preserve
                            this trade for Prescott—influences which may be counted upon to be
                            unsympathetic to the larger navigation project to which the United
                            States is committed. Prescott has always been Conservative in its
                            political faith and not unnaturally the Liberal government would be glad
                            to transfer the allegiance of this section of the Province of Ontario to
                            the Liberal fold.</p>
                        <p>In brief, we have the picture as presented by Mr. Craig of the
                            desirability of cooperating with Canada in a section of the river which
                            will ultimately be a part of the Lakes-to-the-Sea development, but at
                            the same time we have to consider the possibility that the Canadian
                            Government will be less inclined to proceed with navigation development
                            in the entire international section until Prescott at least shall have
                            reaped some benefit from her new and increased activities.</p>
                        <p>In my telegram No. 182 of September 19th I ventured to suggest that we
                            might now take the position that we expect the Canadian Government to
                            give a definite decision with respect to the appointment of
                            commissioners to discuss jointly the various problems involved, which,
                            as the Department will recollect, was put forward by the Secretary of
                            State in his note to the Canadian Government of March 12, 1928.<note

                            opinion that something is needed from us at this time to strengthen Mr.
                            Mackenzie King’s hand in dealing with his Provincial Premiers so that
                            the conference will not adjourn with the comfortable feeling that since
                            the United States is not pressing matters the thorny problems relating
                            to the St. Lawrence can be sidetracked, at least for some months to
                            come.</p>
                        <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0607"/>
                        <p>As I have said, we have before us for consideration two matters which
                            would seem to be closely connected: (1) Canada’s interest in the
                            Thousand Islands section, and (2) the interest of the United States in
                            the appointment of a commission to discuss jointly the details relating
                            to the international section. It would seem possible that the Department
                            might go so far as to say that since the purpose of the proposed
                            commission was to settle details and costs of improvements in the
                            international section the United States Government would prefer to have
                            the benefit of the judgment of the commission before undertaking any
                            piecemeal improvements, since in this manner, and in this manner only,
                            could Congress be induced to make the necessary appropriation for a
                            portion of the international section of the river. In other words, if
                            Canada will appoint commissioners, the United States will, with the
                            approval of the entire commission, undertake to deepen the American
                            canals in the Thousand Islands section.</p>
                        <p>The appointment of commissioners, in my opinion, is important because it
                            will keep before the Canadian and American publics the idea that the St.
                            Lawrence seaway is a living project and something which is actually in
                            the process of adjustment. We might perhaps afford to take the risks
                            involved in the improvement of the channel to Prescott if at the same
                            time the public in both countries is assured through the appointment of
                            commissioners that ways and means for the completion of the undertaking
                            are actually under discussion by both governments. In my opinion it
                            would not be wise for us to proceed in accordance with Mr. Craig’s
                            suggestion without some sort of guarantee that Canada would not hold up
                            indefinitely the work of improving the international section of the
                            river as a whole.</p>
                        <p>I should be very grateful to have the benefit of the Department’s
                            judgment in this whole matter.</p>

                        <p>104. The President has followed with the greatest interest your reports
                            concerning the proposed conference between the Prime Minister and the
                            Premiers of Ontario and Quebec to decide the question of the ownership
                            of the Canadian share of power which will be developed in connection
                            with the proposed Great Lakes–St. Lawrence seaway and has been gratified
                            to note that this conference will take place at an early date.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that Secretary Kellogg’s note of March 12, 1928, to <pb

                            countries proceed with the appointment of Commissioners to discuss

                            project with a view to the formulation of a convention appropriate to
                            the subject. The final sentence of Mr. Beaudry’s reply dated April 5,
                                1928,<note n="32" xml:id="d560fn32"><ref target="frus1928v02#pg_75"

                            follows: “Following this consultation (with the Provinces of Ontario and
                            Quebec) His Majesty’s Government in Canada will be in a position to
                            inform the Government of the United States further of its views on the
                            proposals contained in your note of March 12th.”</p>
                        <p>In view of the above-quoted sentence and the statements of the Prime
                            Minister to you from time to time since then, the President feels
                            confident that the appointment of Commissioners will be agreed upon in
                            the near future. On this account you are authorized, if you deem it
                            advisable to do so, to initiate informal discussion with the Canadian
                            Government concerning the matter of the number and character of
                            Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Government’s proposals as set forth in its note to you of
                            August 7th last<note n="33" xml:id="d560fn3">Not printed.</note> in the
                            matter of providing forthwith a 25 foot channel in the international
                            section of the St. Lawrence River have received the Department’s careful
                            consideration. As you are doubtless aware, the Army engineers made a
                            survey of this section in pursuance of an Act of Congress and submitted
                            estimates of the cost of removing shoals with a view to providing a 22
                            foot channel between Lake Ontario and Ogdensburg on the theory that a
                            channel of that depth is sufficient for the requirements of existing
                            shipping. In these circumstances, the War Department cannot under the
                            law give the matter further consideration unless directed to do so by
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>This Government is, of course, committed to the construction of the Great
                            Lakes–St. Lawrence Seaway which would involve a 27 foot channel in the
                            international section and stands ready to appoint Commissioners to
                            settle jointly details of the project. The United States Government,
                            however, would prefer to have the benefit of the judgment of the
                            Commissioners before undertaking any piecemeal improvements. You may
                            accordingly suggest to the Prime Minister the appointment of such
                            Commissioners at the earliest practicable moment and say to Mr. King
                            that if the Commissioners recommend the immediate improvement of the
                            international section, as proposed by the Canadian Government, and as a
                            part of the broader project, the President will immediately thereafter
                            recommend to Congress that appropriations be voted to carry out the
                            works in American waters.</p>

                            agree to allow the Canadian Government to proceed with the necessary
                            improvements in American waters as well as in Canadian waters on the
                            understanding that the United States Government would ultimately
                            reimburse Canada for expenses incurred in deepening American channels.
                            Such an undertaking could only be given by Congress and in view of the
                            positive action already taken and the definite recommendations made by
                            Army Engineers (Mentioned in paragraph one above) it would probably be
                            exceedingly difficult to convince Congress that more extensive
                            improvements are necessary or desirable unless they could be linked with
                            the whole St. Lawrence project.</p>

                        <p>222. Department’s 104 of October 25 regarding St. Lawrence development.
                            In absence of Prime Minister I have had an informal conversation with
                            Minister of Public Works on lines of Department’s instruction, without
                            mentioning the instruction itself, in an attempt to ascertain his
                            reaction. He felt that, if the United States could not allow Canada to
                            proceed with necessary improvement of American channels on the
                            reimbursement plan, Canada would certainly be permitted to do the
                            improvement without reimbursement. He was of the opinion that the United
                            States could not well object to such a course in view of the fact that
                            at other points in the St. Lawrence waterway system, in particular I
                            believe the Great Lakes, the United States had with the consent of
                            Canada undertaken at American expense certain work on the Canadian side
                            of the boundary, he felt therefore that to refuse Canada now a similar
                            request would be widely criticized.</p>
                        <p>It seems possible therefore that, when I take up the matter with the
                            Prime Minister on his return, he may make a proposal on the above lines
                            and it would be helpful to me to know beforehand the Department’s
                            attitude. The records of the Legation do not reveal the points upon the
                            St. Lawrence system where the United States has at its own cost made
                            improvements on the Canadian side. It is said that a drill boat equipped
                            with 12 drills has already started work at the Brockville Narrows.
                            Canada is, therefore, now going forward with her part of the channels in
                            the Thousand Islands sections and may be expected to press for an early
                            reply regarding her interest in the American channels in this
                            section.</p>

                        <p>230. I presented to the Prime Minister this afternoon the substance of
                            the Department’s 104 of October 25th regarding the St. Lawrence. He told
                            me that he is most anxious to have the conference of Premiers during the
                            second week in December and was telegraphing today to the Minister of
                            Justice and to Dr. Skelton, who are both at London, to ascertain whether
                            they will be back by that date. He does not wish to hold the conference
                            without their presence. Speaking of the appointment of commissioners, he
                            thought that from the Canadian viewpoint it might be better to have the
                            International Joint Commission undertake the work rather than new
                            commissioners, partly, I believe, for the reason that Mr. McGrath,
                            Chairman of the Canadian section of the Commission, is intimately in
                            touch with Premier Ferguson and would therefore be helpful in bringing
                            the Province of Ontario into line. Mr. King asked whether this would be
                            satisfactory to us. I said that I had no information on this point but
                            thought that possibly in view of the technical details to be considered,
                            both engineering and financial, the President might feel the need of
                            appointing other commissioners having the technical knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The question as to the personnel of commissioners would seem to be
                            something which could be taken up either at the time of the meeting of
                            the Premiers or immediately thereafter.</p>

                            that neither Minister of Justice nor Doctor Skelton will return to
                            Ottawa in time to hold conference of Premiers before Christmas and that

                            Lawrence River. In this regard may I point out that the Chargé
                            d’Affaires of the United States Legation at Ottawa was instructed on
                            January 22 last to inform the Canadian Government that the American
                            members of the Joint Board of Engineers would be prepared to meet with
                            the Canadian engineers at any time to deal with the St. Lawrence
                            waterway. It was added that it would be desirable if several days notice
                            of the proposed meeting could be given. It is suggested that your
                            Government indicate a date on which it would be convenient for the Joint
                            Board of Engineers to convene. It might be desirable to save time for
                            the Chairman of the Canadian section of the Board to communicate direct

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, I have the honour to acknowledge your
                                note of September 2nd indicating the readiness of the Government of
                                the United States to proceed with the development of the proposed
                                St. Lawrence waterway at an early date.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian Government has given consideration to some phases of the
                                St. Lawrence waterway question, but in view of the fact that the
                                Parliament of Canada is now in session, and that the opening of the
                                Imperial Conference has been set for September 30th, it will not be
                                possible to deal with the question in a comprehensive manner at the
                                present moment. I purpose, however, to go into the matter
                                immediately upon my return from the Conference in November, and
                                following this examination I shall communicate with you further.</p>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Commissioner Starbuck presided over the meeting as chairman of the host
                            delegation. He welcomed the representatives present and called attention
                            to the fact that it seemed to be the unanimous desire to make this
                            conference a purely informative one for the mutual exchange of ideas
                            between the representatives of aviation radio from both countries
                            present.</p>
                        <p>He then suggested that Colonel Young, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
                            Aeronautics, describe the purpose of the conference.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Young pointed out that the interests of the United States and
                            Canada in aviation radio are of the same character, and stated that
                            aviation radio falls naturally into two distinct classifications:—1.
                            Radio navigation aids to aircraft; 2. Radio communication with
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Commander Edwards then stated that all aviation services in Canada, both
                            civil and military, come under the Department of National Defense, while
                            the allocation of frequencies comes under the jurisdiction of the
                            Department of Marine. Representatives of both Departments were included
                            in the Canadian group present. He suggested that the logical procedure
                            for the conference might be to have the system now being followed in the
                            United States outlined, following which the Canadian representatives
                            could describe the procedure now being followed in Canada, and after
                            this mutual exchange of information some satisfactory arrangement might
                            be worked out.</p>
                        <p>At the suggestion of the Chairman, Captain Hingsburg then proceeded to
                            describe the present system of radio aids to air navigation being
                            followed in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Starting with the teletype circuits which are being extended over United
                            States Civil Airways, he described the operation of these circuits and
                            stated that data are being collected and brought up to the minute every
                            fifteen minutes so that a pilot can depend upon regular weather
                            broadcasts at regular periods. In addition to the collection and
                            dissemination of weather information, the same teletype circuits are
                            used for message and other dispatch work.</p>
                        <p>The information collected by the teletype circuits is broadcast on
                            standardized 2 K W transmitting sets operating in the frequency band
                            237–350 kc.</p>
                        <p>Transmitting sets used for radio beacon work operating most of the time
                            are only interrupted for the periodic weather broadcasts. These
                            broadcasts last usually only three minutes so that the interruption to
                            the beacon service will not be long.</p>
                        <p>The present beacon system makes use of the aural signal, but in view of
                            the development of the visual beacon it is planned to install a <pb
                                n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0617"/>double beacon at one of the
                            stations along the airways, namely Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, so that
                            practical tests on both systems may be carried on. There are at present
                            nine aural beacons in operation and it is planned by next summer to have
                            thirty-five beacons of the aural type operating.</p>
                        <p>Commander Edwards then pointed out that the International Radio
                                Convention<note n="40a" xml:id="d571fn40a">Signed at Washington,
                                November 25, 1927, <ref target="frus1927v01#pg_288"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1927, vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 288</ref>.</note> applies only
                            to international service, and that the convention provides that for
                            regional groups special arrangements may be made. For example, on the
                            North American continent if new arrangements appear to be desirable
                            between the United States, Canada, Mexico and other nations, such
                            arrangements may well be made by a Regional Agreement. Commander Edwards
                            then asked concerning the tie-up between marine and aviation
                            beacons.</p>
                        <p>Captain Hingsburg replied that in this country the services were handled
                            in the same department and were so arranged as to avoid interference. In
                            all cases where interference had been found it has been adjusted by the
                            proper distance separation. He further stated that some thought had been
                            given to the question of having one additional frequency in the same
                            general band for communication messages to planes which messages might
                            be too long to interrupt the regular beacon service. At Commander
                            Edwards’ inquiry Captain Hingsburg explained that the band referred to
                            was from 237 to 350 kilocycles.</p>
                        <p>Major Steel then asked as to how planes would be taken care of from
                            stations using both the visual and aural systems, and Captain Hingsburg
                            replied that only one station at present was proposed for such joint
                            testing and that both services would be made available.</p>
                        <p>Commissioner Starbuck then suggested that the only object of the
                            conference is to provide safe and reliable communication for aircraft in
                            flight and said that undoubtedly the conference will find itself in
                            general agreement. He then asked Mr. Gross to describe the radio
                            communication system now being followed in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross then described in detail the aviation plan adopted by the
                            Federal Radio Commission in cooperation with other United States
                            governmental departments and commercial aviation companies. The plan was
                            distributed to the representatives present and appears as Annex A<note
                                n="41" xml:id="d571fn41">Not printed.</note> to these minutes. He
                            pointed out that the plan was intended to be flexible and had been
                            modified from time to time to suit the requirements of the growing art.
                            There are undoubtedly a number of ways in which the aviation plan can be
                            improved and it is proposed to improve and revise it gradually as more
                            and more practical operating data become available. After some general
                            discussion on this aviation plan, the conference adjourned for lunch at
                            1 p.m.</p>
                        <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0618"/>
                        <p>The meeting reconvened after lunch. Major Steel then described the
                            Canadian system of aviation radio, pointing out that most of the
                            airplane companies are subsidized by air mail contracts. The air mail
                            route starts from Halifax and runs through to Windsor. At Windsor the
                            mail is at present transferred through St. Paul and Minneapolis by
                            American companies to Winnipeg. From Winnipeg the mail is carried by
                            Canadian companies to Vancouver.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed that planes may leave Montreal and proceed through Ottawa
                            to Sudbury. From Sudbury they would travel along the north shore of Lake
                            Superior to Winnipeg. The other main route is the one flying into
                            northern Canada from Edmonton as shown on the attached map<note n="41a"
                                xml:id="d571fn41a">Not reproduced.</note> from opposite page 40 of
                            the 1928 Canadian Aviation Report. In general the radio service is
                            conducted in Canada on 1200 meters (250 kc). The information is
                            collected by teletype and broadcast by radio.</p>
                        <p>In general the system is similar in nature to that used in the United
                            States with the difference that one transmitter is used jointly for
                            aural beacon service, visual beacon service or voice.</p>
                        <p>Three stations are now operating on the above system, in Montreal,
                            Toronto and Winnipeg. It is planned to put eight more into service by
                            next summer.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion on the merits of the visual vs. the aural beacon,
                            Major Steel stated that the Canadian authorities are strongly in favor
                            of the visual beacon and intend using that system.</p>
                        <p>Commander Edwards suggested that a technical committee be appointed to
                            consider the question of how best to link the systems operated by both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>During some discussion on receiving sets Major Steel pointed out that a
                            number of receivers today will cover the range from 850 to 1300 meters
                            (353 to 230 kc), and Captain Hingsburg stated that the best ratio on
                            frequency range is 2.5 or 2.0 to 1. Major Steel then stated that the
                            Canadian authorities do not propose to have communication traffic
                            carried on within bands used for beacon and weather service. It is
                            expected, however, to handle emergency messages of an urgent nature for
                            operating companies by broadcasts to the planes.</p>
                        <p>Major Steel further stated that it is proposed to carry on communication
                            services in entirely different bands but that 100 meters (3000 kc) is
                            entirely too long a wave for this work in Canada.</p>
                        <p>Commander Edwards then stated that the communication might perhaps be in
                            the band around 5000 kc. Itinerant plane communication service is
                            especially important in Canada, but due to the more northerly latitudes
                            higher frequencies are necessary.</p>
                        <p>Major Steel then suggested that the harmonic relationship might <pb
                                n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0619"/>be followed and that if the
                            United States used around 3000 kc, Canada might use a frequency in the
                            neighborhood of 6000 kc. He also stated that the Canadian government
                            contemplated a series of stations from Halifax to Vancouver to be
                            assigned one frequency throughout the chain. Commander Edwards then
                            stated that with reference to his previous suggestion it might be
                            desirable to appoint a technical committee to study this question and
                            formulate some general statements of policy, such committee to report to
                            the main conference at 2 P.M., Friday, April 11.</p>
                        <p>Without objection the suggestion was carried and the following committee
                            was designated for this work: <list>

                        <p>Commissioner Starbuck presided. He suggested that the report of the
                            Technical Committee which met Thursday night and Friday morning be read
                            and discussed. Each item of the report was considered separately and
                            discussed at length, and some improvements in the <pb n="540"
                                xml:id="pg_540" facs="0620"/>language of the suggested texts were
                            made. The corrected report was adopted unanimously. This appears as
                            Annex 1 to these minutes.</p>
                        <p>Commander Edwards then brought up the question of priority of marine over
                            aviation beacons in the band 285–350 kc. and considerable discussion
                            took place. After several resolutions touching on the subject had been
                            presented and considered it was decided that no formal resolution should
                            be adopted on this point.</p>
                        <p>The minutes of the first meeting were then read and after some
                            corrections had been made were adopted.</p>
                        <p>At 6 P.M. the conference adjourned sine die.</p>

                            <p>The coordination of airways communications and radio aids to air
                                navigation in Canada and the United States is desirable, and the
                                following principles are proposed as a guide in the operation of
                                these systems.</p>
                            <p>The conference recommends that the two Governments study these
                                principles and attempt to apply them to their respective systems and
                                that by correspondence and future conferences these principles be
                                further developed and closer coordination obtained.</p>
                            <p>It is further recommended that: <list>

                            America is disposed to sign with the Republic of Chile a Convention for
                            the Prevention of the Smuggling of Alcoholic Liquors that will permit

                            return. This occasions much trouble, as is natural, and much loss of
                            money through theft, leakage and breakage, etc., and places our boats in
                            a very unfavorable situation in comparison with those of countries that
                            have signed this class of Convention with the United States.—</p>

                            59 (Chapter III) of the said Convention. The proceedings shall be
                            regulated by so much of Chapter IV of the said Convention and of Chapter
                            III thereof (special regard being had for Articles 70 and 74, but

                            applicable and to be consistent with the provisions of this agreement.
                            All sums of money which may be awarded by the tribunal on account of any

                            awarded by it, at a rate of five per cent on such sums, or at such lower
                            rate as may be agreed upon between the two Governments; the deficiency,
