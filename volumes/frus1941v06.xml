                <p>The principles which guide the compilation and editing of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> are stated in Department of State Regulation 1350 of
                    June 15, 1961, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925, by Mr. Frank
                    B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the current regulation is
                    printed below:</p>

                        Diplomacy</hi></p>
                <p rend="flushleft">1351 <hi rend="italic">Scope of Documentation</hi></p>
                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States,
                        Diplomatic Papers</hi>, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                    policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                    security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of
                    the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which
                    contributed to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                    supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                    understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers should
                    be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers</hi>, shall be
                    edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the Department of
                    State. The editing of the record shall be guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity. There shall be no alteration of the text, no deletions without
                    indicating where in the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts
                    which were of major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing shall be omitted
                    for the purpose of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as
                    a defect of policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for
                    the following reasons: <list>

                        <p>23. Your 27, January 13, 11 p.m. Please inform Dr. Fenwick as follows on
                            behalf of the Under Secretary.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the preliminary draft of the security zone convention
                            dated December 14, the Department considers the last part of Article II
                            ambiguous as to whether both the attack and operations must have begun
                            outside the zone. With respect to Article III a serious question has
                            arisen whether the Article would be inconsistent with the legislative
                            proposals now before the Congress designed to give assistance to states
                            defending themselves. Article VI is considered too mandatory and it is
                            suggested that there be added in the third line after “shall” and before
                            “undertake” the words “determine <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0012"
                            />whether they should”, and that in each of the subsections of the
                            Article “shall” should be changed to “may”.</p>
                        <p>Please make the following oral confidential statement to Professor
                            Fenwick: In view of the rapidly changing international situation and of
                            the recent problems in Brazilian-British relations,<note n="5"

                            such an attitude should be strongly encouraged.</p>

                            to submit merely a preliminary draft, permitting inference that
                            governments would want to suggest changes before final draft submitted
                            to signature. Hence the Department is entirely free to suggest
                            alterations in the text. I would recommend, nevertheless, that instead
                            of attempting to alter phrases in the convention, to prevent obvious
                            conflicts with pending legislation, the Department could shelve the
                            whole convention by delaying its return to the Committee. Committee will
                            submit draft convention to Pan-American Union as confidential documents,
                            with the request that the Union transmit it to the American Governments
                            as confidential. Can delay arrival of convention at the Pan-American
                            Union at least 1 month. [Fenwick.]</p>

                        <p>The Department’s telegram of the 17th [<hi rend="italic">16th?</hi>]
                            inst. arrived after the definitive text of the treaty had been agreed
                            upon,—the text not differing substantially from the one submitted to you
                            in my letter of Dec. 14th. In answering the Department’s telegram it
                            seemed to me that under the circumstances it was not advisable to
                            attempt to revise the text already agreed upon, but rather to bury the
                            whole convention by delaying its submission for signature. For, apart
                            from the particular clause in Article III which conflicted with
                            legislation pending before Congress, the convention as a whole was out
                            of line with the new policy of the United States. I arranged, therefore,
                            to have the convention forwarded to the Pan American Union as “not for
                            publication”, and also to delay the forwarding almost a month.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to my expectations, when the convention came before the
                            Committee for final signature, the proposal was made to eliminate the
                            clause in Article III referring to warships making repairs and obtaining
                            fuel in neutral ports, and after considerable discussion a majority
                            voted in favor of it. With that clause out, it will not make much
                            difference if the text is published in spite of our recommendation that
                            it be withheld from publication.</p>
                        <p>You will understand my embarrassment in trying to act at once in a
                            technical and judicial capacity and yet take account of the practical
                            aspects of the situation and of the new developments in the policy of
                            the United States. I am trying to use the best judgment I can under the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I might add that Ambassador Labougle, of Argentina, substituting <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0014"/>for Podestá Costa, is proving to be
                            a very helpful member of the Committee. He combines right principles
                            with good common sense.</p>
                        <p>One word more. The Committee expects to take up the Uruguayan proposal
                            for the extention of territorial waters at its next meeting. I note the
                            Department’s views on the subject. Also, the long-delayed problem of
                            contraband will come up next week; but that is now water under the
                            bridge.</p>
                        <p>I have completed the preliminary draft of a code of neutrality in some
                            130 articles, along the lines of the analysis I submitted to you two
                            months ago. Each article will be accompanied by “Comment” explaining the
                            background of the rule laid down and justifying its adoption. My plan is
                            to submit the articles to the Committee one by one for discussion and
                            criticism. That will keep the Committee going as long as the American
                            Governments consider it should be kept going. I might add, on that
                            point, that the Committee is serving a useful purpose just now quite
                            apart from its technical functions as a Neutrality Committee. It is
                            constantly referred to in the press as a “symbol” of inter-American
                            unity. Even symbols have their value in these troubled times.</p>

                            extend the scope of its functions in every appropriate way during these
                            critical times. My judgment is that the points made in the memorandum
                            are satisfactory. Will you let me have your reaction?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Professor Fenwick</hi>: I thoroughly agree
                            with you that the functions of the Neutrality Committee might be
                            extended in scope, as suggested by you in the memorandum which you left
                            with me on May 9th.</p>
                        <p>However, it is my view that if the Committee undertakes to deal with the
                            subject of claims growing out of the present war in Europe, it should
                            limit itself to a consideration of the basis of liability, that is to
                            say, whether the government is, in all the circumstances, liable for the
                            acts giving rise to the claim, as distinguished from the basis of the
                            compensation to be paid once liability is determined. Generally <pb
                                n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0017"/>speaking, the amount of
                            compensation properly payable for loss of property is the same whether
                            the destruction results from bombardment, for example, or from other
                            cause, if the illegality of the act be established.</p>
                        <p>For various reasons, I am of the opinion that the suggestion contained in
                            the last paragraph of your memorandum should not be advanced. The
                            general subject of inter-American claims would not seem to fall within
                            the competence of the Neutrality Committee. The subject of pecuniary
                            claims was referred, as you doubtless know, to the Committee of Experts
                            established pursuant to a resolution adopted at Montevideo in 1933.<note

                            which I put before the Committee during the sessions at which the

                        <p>When the problem first came up for study, I presented to the Committee a
                            tentative draft of an opinion based upon what seemed to me to be the
                            lesson to be drawn from the Conference for the Codification of
                            International Law held at The Hague in 1930,<note n="15" xml:id="d9fn4"

                                facs="0018"/>the conflicting opinions, no agreement could be
                            reached. This draft (see Enclosure No. 1) proposed as a compromise that
                            the existing situation in respect to strict territorial waters should be
                            maintained; but that a limited jurisdiction or control be recognized to
                            a distance of twelve miles for customs, police and sanitary
                            administration, and to a distance of not less than twenty-five miles (as
                            proposed by the Uruguayan Government) for protection against hostilities
                            in time of war.</p>
                        <p>This compromise, however, proved unacceptable to other members of the
                            Committee, and a majority insisted that there must be an extension not
                            merely of control but of sovereignty. I raised the objection that this
                            would involve encroachment upon existing fishing rights on the high
                            seas, as well as other rights associated with the freedom of the seas;
                            and that these were problems that could only be settled at a general
                            international conference of all nations. Besides, the Committee had no
                            data before it to justify recommending an extension of exclusive fishing
                            rights, quite apart from the fact that the three-mile limit was fixed in
                            numerous treaties. But the objection was waived aside as of minor
                            consequence.</p>
                        <p>I then argued that an extension of sovereignty, being made for the
                            obvious purpose of protection against hostilities, would weaken the
                            force of the Security Zone convention now pending adoption by the
                            American Governments. In line with this approach I introduced a project
                            (see Enclosure No. 2) reciting the fact that the Havana Meeting had
                            indicated the determination of the American Governments to maintain the
                            Zone in spite of violations of it, and affirming that the pending
                            convention could furnish the desired protection against hostilities in
                            so far as the American Republics were willing to resort to sanctions to
                            enforce it. No mere assertion of a wider sovereignty, not accepted by
                            the belligerents, would have any greater effect.</p>
                        <p>This second project being unacceptable, I then insisted that before the
                            Committee could come to an adequate decision in respect to the variety
                            of questions associated with the extension of territorial waters in
                            addition to the primary interest of protection against hostilities, it
                            should be better informed in respect to the intentions of the American
                            Governments with regard to these problems. With that object in view I
                            introduced a third project (see Enclosure No. 3), reciting the fact that
                            there were other interests at issue as well as protection against
                            hostilities, and recommending that an inquiry be made of the American
                            Governments to find out which of the various objectives they had in mind
                            in asking the Committee to give an opinion on the general subject. But
                            this project met with no greater favor than the others.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the discussions the Chairman of the Committee
                            introduced a lengthy statement in answer to my objections to the
                            extension of territorial waters. I made a formal reply to the statement
                                <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0019"/>at the next meeting of the
                            Committee (see Enclosure No. 4). My reply more or less sums up the
                            situation as it had developed in the Committee by that time. It had no
                            effect in changing the opinions of the members in respect to the
                            advantages, as they saw them, of the extension of sovereignty. Much
                            stress was put upon the alleged approval which the Havana Meeting had
                            given, in principle, to the extension of territorial waters, by the fact
                            that the sub-committee had revised the Uruguayan proposal so as to make
                            it read that territorial waters “should be extended” instead of that it
                            was “desirable” to do so, I argued that the change introduced by the
                            subcommittee was merely one of drafting, and that the project came to
                            the Neutrality Committee without a prior expression of approval or
                            disapproval from the Meeting. But to no effect.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy (see Enclosure No. 5<note n="16" xml:id="d9fn5">The
                                enclosure printed below.</note>) of the dissenting opinion which I
                            entered in the minutes and which was attached to the copy of the
                            recommendation sent by the Committee to the Pan American Union. While it
                            was with regret that I found it necessary to disagree with the majority
                            of the Committee, it was better to disagree than to compromise on issues
                            that I felt were fundamental. Besides, the dissenting opinion gave me an
                            opportunity to emphasise points which it would have been impossible for
                            me to have introduced into the <hi rend="italic">Considerando</hi>

                            convenient. I assume that the next Meeting of Foreign Ministers will
                            refer the matter to the Ninth International Conference of American
                            States, which is due to meet in 1943.<note n="17" xml:id="d9fn6">The

                                would have convened in 1943 was, on January 6, 1943, postponed. The

                                territorial waters submitted to us by the Second Meeting of
                                Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics. The reasons
                                for my dissent appear in detail in the Minutes of the Committee.
                                They may be summarized here, as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The chief objective of the proposal of the Government of
                                        Uruguay is to secure better protection against the
                                        commission by belligerents of acts of hostility within the
                                        waters adjacent to neutral coasts; and it appears to be the
                                        belief of the Government of Uruguay, as it is also the
                                        belief of the majority members of the Neutrality Committee,
                                        that this objective would be more adequately attained if the
                                        sovereignty of the state were extended over a wider area of
                                        adjacent waters than that over which it now legally
                                        extends.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>In so far as concerns the war now in progress, in respect
                                        to which the American Republics are at this moment neutral,
                                        I am unable to find any reason for believing that an
                                        assertion of sovereignty over adjacent waters to a distance
                                        of twelve miles would be any more effective than the
                                        proclamation of the Security Zone made by the Declaration of
                                            Panama.<note n="18" xml:id="d9fn7"><ref

                                        would be under no legal obligation to respect a mere
                                        assertion of sovereignty which they themselves had not
                                        agreed to; and it is to be anticipated that the same reasons
                                        that might lead the belligerents to violate the Security
                                        Zone would lead them to conduct their hostilities in the
                                        wider area of waters over which the majority of the
                                        Committee recommends that sovereignty be extended.</item>

                                    <item>But in addition to the ineffectiveness, with respect to
                                        present hostilities, of a mere declaration that sovereignty
                                        should be extended to a distance of twelve miles, there is
                                        the more important consideration that such a declaration
                                        would greatly weaken the effectiveness of the convention for
                                        the Security Zone now pending adoption by the American
                                        Governments. The resolutions taken at Havana clearly
                                        indicate that the American Republics did not intend to
                                        retreat from the Declaration of Panama establishing the
                                        Security Zone. Rather they expressed their determination to
                                        stand by the Security Zone; and they called upon the
                                        Neutrality Committee to draft a solemn treaty reaffirming
                                        the principles underlying the Security Zone and proposing
                                        measures of cooperation for the enforcement of the Zone. If
                                        now the Uruguayan project were to be adopted, under
                                        circumstances clearly indicating that the object in so doing
                                        was to secure greater protection against hostilities by the
                                        belligerents, the belligerents would naturally interpret
                                        such action as a confession that the Declaration of Panama
                                        went too far and that the American Republics were now
                                        prepared to modify their original demand. Under such

                                        against hostilities should be considered at a general
                                        international conference at the close of the war. The
                                        experience of the present hostilities convinces me that the
                                        protection desired will be more adequately attained by the
                                        cooperative action of all nations to outlaw acts of
                                        aggression, rather than by accepting the legality of war and
                                        then attempting to regulate the conduct of belligerents. But
                                        whether or not this forecast be correct, it would seem to be
                                        better at this time to leave the decision as to the best
                                        means of securing in more permanent form the desired
                                        protection against hostilities until an international
                                        conference can be called at which a general legal agreement
                                        might be reached.</item>

                                    <item>There remains the question of the desirability of
                                        extending territorial waters to attain other objectives than
                                        the primary one of protection against hostilities by the
                                        belligerents. Such other objectives include the extension of
                                        exclusive fishing rights over the wider area of territorial
                                        waters, the enforcement of customs and sanitary regulations,
                                        police control in the interest of preventing crimes
                                        initiated outside territorial waters, and jurisdiction over
                                        acts performed on board vessels entering territorial waters.
                                        These matters are of greater importance for some of the
                                        American States than for others; and it is not clear that a
                                        uniform rule would be the most convenient regulation of
                                        them. I agree that in the presence of an emergency these
                                        matters could and should properly be subordinated to the
                                        more important objective of the prevention of hostilities.
                                        But in as much as the proposed extension of territorial
                                        waters does not carry with it, in my opinion, any greater
                                        protection against present hostilities, I see no reason why
                                        the other problems involved in the extension of territorial
                                        waters should be set aside without due consideration.</item>

                                    <item>Not only are these other problems involved in the
                                        extension of territorial waters important in themselves and
                                        worthy, in the interest of the individual American
                                        Republics, of more careful study than it has been possible
                                        to give them, but they are problems in which other,
                                        non-American, nations have vital interests at stake and have
                                        traditional rights solidly founded in international law.
                                        Hence the solution of these problems should await an
                                        international conference at which all of the nations could
                                        be represented. The American Republics do not have it in
                                        their power to change the law of the sea. I believe that the
                                        Declaration of Panama in respect to the Security Zone was
                                        justified by the fact that the belligerents themselves had
                                        departed from the <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0022"
                                        />traditional law of the sea by the unlawful use of the
                                        submarine and by the establishment of combat zones and the
                                        imposition of unwarranted restraints upon neutral trade. But
                                        that is as far as we can go,—defense against illegal acts of
                                        the belligerents. We are not justified, in my opinion, in
                                        proposing to change the law of the sea in respect to other
                                        matters which have no connection with emergency defense
                                        against hostilities. At this time when international law has
                                        been shaken to its foundations by the lawless acts of the
                                        Axis Powers, it is all the more incumbent upon us to
                                        maintain the fundamental principles of the equality of
                                        states and of the freedom of the seas, and to avoid doing
                                        anything that might be interpreted by other nations as an
                                        attempt to introduce new rules of law without taking into
                                        account not merely the interests of the American Republics
                                        but the interests of all members of the international
                                        community.</item>

                                    <item>The proper procedure for our Neutrality Committee appears
                                        to me to be to give an opinion (1) calling attention to the
                                        pending draft convention for the maintenance of the Security
                                        Zone and pointing out that in so far as the American
                                        Republics are prepared to enforce it the convention would
                                        give as much protection against hostilities as is obtainable
                                        during the present war; and (2) recommending that at the
                                        close of the war the American States participate in a
                                        general international conference at which they may consider
                                        whether a united and collective demand for a further
                                        extension of territorial waters may not be the best means
                                        for protecting neutral states against hostilities in the
                                        future, if other more comprehensive measures for the
                                        prevention of war itself should fail.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: May I make a brief report to
                            you of the work of the Neutrality Committee during the past month.</p>
                        <p>Since the completion of the recommendation on the Extension of
                            Territorial Waters the Committee has devoted its entire time to the
                            preparation of the General Convention on Neutral Rights and Duties which
                            the Havana Meeting of Foreign Ministers asked the Committee to
                            undertake. The basis of our discussions has been the draft code which I
                            prepared some six months ago, a copy of which I left with Mr. Bonsai
                            last spring. Work on the code proceeds slowly, chiefly due to the fact
                            that two of the members of our Committee are so preoccupied <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0023"/>with other official duties that it is
                            impossible for them to attend meetings oftener than once a week.
                            Doubtless if the completion of the code were a matter of greater
                            urgency, this difficulty could be overcome. But the members are aware
                            that the American Governments have already determined upon their
                            policies in relation to the belligerents during the present war, so that
                            the decisions of the Committee on the problems raised by the code are
                            more or less academic in character.</p>
                        <p>Some thirty articles of the code have been approved in tentative form and
                            are now being forwarded to the Pan American Union for submission to the
                            American Governments for criticisms and suggestions. This procedure was
                            not provided for at Havana, but the Committee is of the opinion that in
                            view of the controversial nature of so many of the problems of
                            neutrality it is desirable to submit a tentative draft before proceeding
                            to the final draft. Together with the articles the Committee is sending
                            brief commentaries upon each separate article. These commentaries will
                            later be developed into an exhaustive study of the background of the
                            particular article, accompanied by a complete documentation of previous
                            conventions on the subject and of the legislation of the American
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Committee is taking a brief recess until the middle of November, and
                            I am planning to return to the United States in order to attend to my
                            business affairs.</p>
                        <p>I trust, however, that I may be able to use the occasion to discuss with
                            you more in detail the future work of the Committee in the light of
                            recent developments, and I would like to put before you some suggestions
                            in anticipation of the Third Meeting of Foreign Ministers here in Rio,
                            whenever that is to be held.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards,</p>

                            in your discussions with the Committee on territorial waters, and have
                            no doubt that the logical basis for the views expressed will appeal to
                            many of our good friends and colleagues in the other American republics,
                            as well as to the international legal fraternity.</p>
                        <p>I have consulted with Mr. Hackworth regarding the various points
                            contained in your letter of August 22, and he is likewise in agreement
                            with the position you have felt it necessary to take. While of course we
                            all regret that it was not possible for the Neutrality Committee to
                            reach unanimous agreement on its recommendations, we cannot see that you
                            had any satisfactory alternative other than to submit the dissenting
                            opinion which it is understood will appear in the published report of
                            your meetings.<note n="20" xml:id="d11fn1">See bracketed note, <ref

                        <p>I perceive no objection to the action of the Committee in forwarding to
                            the Pan American Union the articles of the proposed neutrality code
                            which have already been approved in tentative form by the Committee.
                            This procedure should facilitate mature consideration of the problem by
                            the governments of all the American republics.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will continue to remain in close touch with the
                            Department in order that we may benefit by your wise counsel. It does
                            not seem to me to be too early for us to commence our preparations for
                            the Ninth International Conference of American States, which is
                            scheduled to be held in 1943.<note n="21" xml:id="d11fn2">See footnote
                                17, <ref target="#pg_9">p. 9</ref>.</note> At the same time, the
                            same efforts would be extremely useful in preparation for any
                            international conference which might be held at the close of the present
                            war to deal with questions of international law.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Attention of Mr. Daniels, Division of Latin American
                            Republics.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Daniels</hi>: In pursuance of our recent
                            conversation I am submitting herewith for the consideration of the
                            Department some observations upon the work of the Inter-American
                            Neutrality Committee, <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0025"/>and the
                            possible new fields into which its jurisdiction might be extended. My
                            observations are purely personal, and without any reference to the views
                            of the other members of the Committee.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">A. <hi rend="italic">Extension of the present functions
                                of the Committee</hi>.</p>
                        <p>1. It seems clear that the task of preparing a convention covering the
                            whole law of neutrality, assigned to the Committee by the Consultative
                            Meeting of the Foreign Ministers at Havana in July, 1940, has lost its
                            purpose and meaning so far as the war now in progress is concerned. For
                            the past six months the Committee has continued to work on the project,
                            not because of a belief in its intrinsic importance, but because the
                            Committee has wanted to show the American Republics that it could be
                            relied upon to do the work assigned it and do it well. Since the
                            outbreak of war between the United States and Japan, however, it is
                            obvious that, whatever future value the neutrality convention might have
                            (and I myself believe it would be very little), it would hurt the
                            standing of the Committee to continue to deal with problems in a
                            vacuum.</p>
                        <p>2. There are, however, new problems growing out of the status of
                            neutrality which might be assigned to the Committee. Last spring I
                            submitted to Mr. Welles a brief analysis of the kinds of “claim cases”
                            which might appropriately be assigned to the Committee.<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d12fn1">See Mr. Fenwick’s memorandum of May 9, <ref
                                    target="#pg_5">p. 5</ref>.</note> These cases might arise from
                            the requisition by neutral American States of merchant vessels of the
                            belligerents and of countries occupied by the belligerents; or that
                            might arise from violation by belligerent warships and aircraft of
                            neutral American rights; or, again, that might arise from damage by
                            illegal activities of belligerent agents in neutral American
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>My suggestion would be that if the functions of the Committee were
                            enlarged to give it jurisdiction in respect to these “claim cases”, the
                            recommendations of the Committee would deal chiefly with the legal
                            principles involved in the settlement of the cases, and would have for
                            the present an advisory character only.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">B. <hi rend="italic">Long-range Development of the Work
                                of the Committee</hi>.</p>
                        <p>1. The Committee, during the period while its functions were still of
                            intrinsic value, demonstrated to the American Republics the advantages
                            of a small permanent committee meeting regularly and devoting its whole
                            time to the tasks assigned to it. The resolution taken by the Foreign
                            Ministers at Havana shows that the Committee, although not containing
                            representatives of all the American States, had won the respect of the
                            Inter-American community for the impartiality of its decisions. The
                            experience obtained by the Committee and the precedent it has set for
                            the handling of technical <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0026"
                            />problems by a body of experts should not be lost. As has often been
                            observed in matters of inter-American, as well as in international,
                            organization, it is easier to build upon an existing institution than to
                            create a new one. Problems calling for solution lie all about us. The
                            present crisis would seem not only to demonstrate the need of a
                            permanent legal committee but the opportunity that exists to create
                            one.</p>
                        <p>2. The Inter-American Neutrality Committee might, therefore, without
                            great difficulty be transformed into an “Intra-American Committee on
                            International Law”. It would retain its purely advisory character and it
                            would, as the suggested name implies, be limited in its functions to
                            recommendations on questions of technical law. But its field would
                            naturally range beyond that of neutrality, or of belligerency, into the
                            domain of international law in general. The jurisdiction of the
                            Committee would thus include the many problems, such as the law of
                            foreign investments and the diplomatic protection of citizens abroad, in
                            respect to which it has hitherto proved impossible to codify
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the numerous bodies engaged in the codification of
                            international law in accordance with the provisions of Inter-American
                            treaties and resolutions of recent years, the proposed Committee on
                            International Law might well act as a central exchange or as a sort of
                            secretariat with functions of its own, so that it could bring about the
                            results desired from these bodies without disturbing their formal
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>Consideration might be given to the absorption by such a Committee on
                            International Law of the functions of the “Commission of Inquiry”
                            provided for in the Gondra Treaty of 1923,<note n="23" xml:id="d12fn2"

                                145.</note> The mere fact of the existence of a Committee on
                            International Law, organized on a permanent basis and actively
                            functioning, might facilitate the settlement of such disputes as the
                            pending boundary controversy between Peru and Ecuador, where questions
                            of mixed law and fact are involved.</p>
                        <p>3. Assuming the desirability of the creation of such a permanent
                            Committee on International Law, it would be a question of practical
                            detail whether its location should be at Rio de Janeiro, or at
                            Washington where the advantages of library facilities are an important
                            consideration. The Committee might readily be given “circuit functions”,
                            which would lead it to meet from time to time in other capitals of the
                            American States.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0027"/>
                        <p>Consideration might also be given to the possible affiliation of the
                            proposed Committee with the Pan-American Union, in case it were decided
                            to locate the Committee in Washington. This might help to obviate any
                            criticism that the Committee was too much under the dominance of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>If it should be deemed feasible and desirable to create a Permanent
                            Committee on International Law, it would seem necessary to give to it a
                            competent research staff which the present Neutrality Committee does not
                            possess.</p>

                            Professor Fenwick’s message was delivered to Doctor Mello Franco. He
                            will bring the matter before the Committee on December 15. Dr. Franco is
                            of the belief, however, that the Committee cannot extend its functions
                            without the consent of the interested governments. He suggests that this
                            matter be studied at the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs shortly
                            to take place in Rio.</p>

                        <p>The President stated that the Uruguayan Government would in the next few
                            days refer its proposed declaration to the other American Republics. He
                            emphasized that this action would not be in the nature of a consultation
                            but merely for the purpose of informing those governments in accordance
                            with inter-American procedure and might possibly lead to similar
                            declarations on their part.</p>
                        <p>He said that Uruguay had already received indications that the replies
                            from Bolivia, Mexico, Cuba and the Caribbean countries would be
                            generally favorable and that he hoped he could count on Brazil, but that
                            he was doubtful of the nature of the replies of Argentina, Chile and
                            even Peru.…The President stated that by avoiding the consultatory form
                            Uruguay would be free in any case to make its declaration in any form it
                            may see fit.</p>

                        <p>252. My telegram No. 250, June 19, 1941. An urgent call from the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn1">Alberto Guani, Uruguayan
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> we discussed today the proposed
                            Uruguayan declaration. He said that its general tenor had already been
                            discussed with certain [countries?] who were believed to be sympathetic
                            but that it had been decided to send the final text by air mail tomorrow
                            to the 19 other republics for their information and “concordancia”. He
                            reiterated what the President had told me [yesterday?] that the matter
                            was being handled in such a way as to leave Uruguay free, in case of
                            dissent on the part of one or more of the American Republics, either to
                            promulgate [the?] declaration unilaterally or to use it as the basis for
                            a more extended discussion in a possible future conference of American
                            [Ministers?] of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>…He said that many of the American Governments were “good friends” of the
                            United States and that he hopes that our Government will give active
                            support to the Uruguayan action and will urge prompt and favorable
                            similar action in those capitals where Uruguay has no diplomatic
                            representatives. In the opinion of the Foreign Minister Brazil is the
                            most important state to swing into line and he intimated that although
                            he and Aranha<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn2">Oswaldo Aranha, Brazilian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> generally see eye to eye our
                            assistance in Rio de Janeiro would be appreciated. He intimated that
                            such assistance might be necessary in Chile and Peru. I am cabling
                            translation of an advance text which Guani says is correct and which
                            will serve, except for certain refinements, the purpose of our
                            Government in communicating with our Missions abroad regarding the
                            Uruguayan action. That text will follow by air mail when received and
                            any [changes?] will be cabled.</p>

                            attitude. The Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs <pb n="21"
                                xml:id="pg_21" facs="0031"/>has suggested that they meet at Porto

                                    Foreign Affairs of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay considers it
                                    to be of the highest interest to inform His Excellency, the
                                    Minister of Foreign Affairs of [the United States of America],
                                    of certain points of view in the light of which the Government
                                    is studying the possibilities for the maintenance of the
                                    security and territorial integrity of our countries in the event
                                    that an American nation should be drawn into war with nations of
                                    other continents.</p>
                                <p>The development of the spiritual and material union of the

                                    during recent years makes it advisable [at this time, and
                                    particularly beneficial in the common interest of all the
                                    Americas, to decide upon a statement of points of view in this
                                    regard.]</p>
                                <p>The contingency which is of concern to Uruguay should be
                                    considered, in many of its aspects, as being similar to that
                                    which might confront the other nations of the continent; but it
                                    should be recalled that, on other occasions, our country found
                                    itself in a situation where it was necessary to adopt a definite
                                    attitude, declaring that the execution of the principles of
                                    American solidarity was the guiding rule of its international
                                    policy.</p>
                                <p>In effect: In declaring in 1917 that any act susceptible of
                                    affecting adversely the rights of a nation of the continent
                                    should be considered as constituting an offense committed
                                    against all the nations and [should] cause a common and uniform
                                    reaction, Uruguay based itself upon the most solid principles of
                                    Pan-Americanism, which should be interpreted not only as a moral
                                    doctrine or ideology, but <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0032"
                                    />also in the sense of a positive policy, a point of practical
                                    application in the hour of continental decision.</p>
                                <p>The purpose made manifest by our peoples to strengthen the bonds
                                    which identify the American community, have been evident since
                                    the moment of their struggles for emancipation, when the concept
                                    of country, open and free, embraced the whole length and breadth
                                    of the continent. The history of America during the past and
                                    present centuries, bears numerous examples which demonstrate the
                                    persistence of that same spirit which today represents one of
                                    the most solid guarantees for the security of the new world. In
                                    a letter now memorable Artigas had said, addressing himself to
                                    Bolivar, in bespeaking protection for his ships, that in their
                                    struggles both were intimately united by bonds of nature and of
                                    common interests. ‘On my part,’ he added, ‘I proffer like
                                    treatment to the standard of your republic should the
                                    circumstance of time make it possible to see it displayed in our
                                    ports.’</p>
                                <p>This same thought many years later inspired the Government of
                                    Uruguay to issue its decree of June 18, 1917,<note n="7"

                                    country which, in defense of its rights should find itself in a
                                    state of war with nations of other continents, would be treated
                                    as a belligerent. In anticipation of an agreement in this
                                    regard, Uruguay reiterated its deep conviction that the policy
                                    of America would evolve, definitively, a practical formula of
                                    solidary action in defense of its ideals of liberty and
                                    democracy.</p>
                                <p>The subsequent evaluation [<hi rend="italic">evolution</hi>] of
                                    international law appeared to be directed towards the
                                    achievement of a system of proscription of violence and of the
                                    establishment of peace. There were created by this means
                                    obligations of another order in such manner as to necessitate a
                                    reconciliation of the theory of American solidarity with the
                                    pact of the League of Nations for example, and with other
                                    agreements celebrated to broaden the methods of pacific solution
                                    in international conflicts. All recourse to any of these
                                    procedures being discarded for the moment, the international
                                    action of the American countries can only be made effective by
                                    the energy of their union for the purpose of imposing the will
                                    of justice over the will of force.</p>

                                    provides that any attack by a non-American state against the
                                    integrity or territorial inviolability, against the sovereignty
                                    or political independence of an American state, shall be
                                    considered as an act of aggression against the states signatory
                                    to the declaration. Should any acts of aggression be committed,
                                    or should there be reasons to believe that an aggression is
                                    being prepared by a non-American state against the integrity or
                                    territorial inviolability, against the sovereignty or political
                                    independence of an American state, the signatory states shall
                                    consult among themselves with a view to adopting such measures
                                    as it may be advisable to take. For the purpose of facilitating
                                    such consultations the Declaration of Lima established the
                                    method of meetings of Ministers of Foreign Relations. Doubtless
                                    when considered opportune this mechanism will be set in motion.
                                    The Government of Uruguay, however, feels at this time that the
                                    defense of the continent against war may present situations of
                                    extreme urgency in such manner as not to allow them the holding
                                    of a Meeting of Ministers. There should be borne in mind
                                    moreover that there have been established certain rules for the
                                    convocation of such meetings such as the transmission of a list
                                    of proposed topics to the Directive Council [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >Governing Board</hi>] of the Pan-American Union and to
                                    await through the same channel the receipt of the comments which
                                    the Governments may desire to present.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Uruguay believes on its part at a given moment
                                    the countries of America may find themselves obliged to act
                                    swiftly and in such contingency to adopt immediate measures. The
                                    line of conduct of this Chancellery would have to be consonant
                                    with its tradition of deeply rooted concepts of American
                                    brotherhood and by virtue of this fact is prepared in
                                    anticipation of the future development of events to define its
                                    position. In June 1917 Uruguay expressed the hope that the
                                    nations of this hemisphere would arrive at an agreement for the
                                    fixing of these principles. There having now been established
                                    the common interest and the desire to make effective their
                                    solidarity, there being already fixed at the recent conferences
                                    the principle that any act committed against a continental state
                                    shall be considered as an aggression against all, we would
                                    appear to be in <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0034"/>a
                                    position to be able to affirm that the agreements to which
                                    Uruguay then aspired do now exist in their full meaning. An
                                    accord in the attitudes of all the American countries would
                                    therefore now be highly opportune.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Uruguay would therefore greatly appreciate
                                    receiving the views in this respect of the Chancellery of [the
                                    United States of America,] assuring it at once of the high value
                                    which it attaches to the eminent opinions of your friendly

                        <p>Inasmuch as this communication has been sent by air mail, the time of its
                            receipt by the Government to which you are accredited will vary. It is
                            believed that in the case of most countries their Foreign Ministers will
                            take opportunity to discuss the proposal with you to ascertain the point
                            of view of this Government. Failing this initiative, it is hoped that
                            you will be able, in the next few days, without forcing an opening, to
                            lead a conversation around to a discussion of the Uruguayan proposal.
                            When the occasion arises you will state that this Government views the
                            initiative of Uruguay as an example of enlightened and far-sighted
                            statesmanship giving content to the oft-repeated pledges of
                            inter-American solidarity. You will tactfully urge, therefore, the
                            desirability of a sympathetic and favorable response.</p>

                            requested to consult with the Uruguayan representative in order to
                            coordinate action.</p>

                        <p>457. From the Under Secretary. Your 695, June 20, 7 p.m. Kindly inform
                            Aranha that I was delighted to learn that he viewed sympathetically the
                            Uruguayan proposal. I consider it farsighted and enlightened and giving
                            content to the oft-repeated inter-American pledges of solidarity. I am
                            certain that the Government of Uruguay would deeply appreciate whatever
                            support Aranha feels that he can give to the proposition before such
                            other governments as Brazil might be prepared to approach in a purely
                            informal way. I am sending a circular telegram to all our missions,

                            express this Government’s views. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>263. Department’s 128, June 21, 10 p.m. For the Under Secretary. Guani
                            was greatly pleased at your message. Although I reiterated to him that
                            our Chiefs of Mission in all of the American capitals had been
                            instructed to support the Uruguayan proposal, Guani asked me to convey
                            to you his thought that some special representation by our Minister in
                            Asunción would be both helpful and effective. He said that he was taking
                            as a preliminary gauge to the reaction of the various governments the
                            tenor of notations which he was beginning to receive <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0036"/>today from Uruguay’s representatives in

                                xml:id="d23fn1">Luís Argaña.</note> has been here to-day during the
                            visit of the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Argentina</hi> and Guani’s request
                            with regard to Asunción loan [<hi rend="italic">may?</hi>] be founded on
                            the reaction which he encountered yesterday from Argaña who is leaving
                            tonight for Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>Guani said that the Argentine Foreign Minister had telephoned him three
                            times yesterday with regard to the text but he had declined to give it
                            over the telephone and that it had been delivered in Buenos Aires
                            yesterday. While Guani still expects some difficulty in Buenos Aires and
                            said that it might be necessary to ask for our support there in case no
                            answer was forthcoming in the course of 2 or 3 days, he was very much
                            pleased with the gradual change of public opinion in the Argentine which
                            he said was judging by today’s <hi rend="italic">Prensa</hi>

                        <p>48. The Department’s circular telegram of June 21. The Uruguayan Foreign
                            Minister has indicated to Chapin that some special representation by you
                            to the Paraguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding the Uruguayan
                            circular would be of particular value. Please therefore take every
                            suitable occasion to emphasize the Department’s conviction that the
                            Uruguayan initiative represents an enlightened contribution to the
                            development of inter-American solidarity and one which deserves a most
                            favorable reception on the part of all the American republics.</p>

                            indication of response to the Uruguayan initiative—principally, it
                            appears, because the proposal has been slow in reaching the governments
                            of the other American republics, having been transmitted by air mail.
                            Reports have been received from our missions as follows: <quote

                                    by the Argentine Government. Buenos Aires press reaction was

                        <p>The Acting Secretary of State of the United States of America desires to
                            inform His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Oriental
                            Republic of Uruguay of the gratification with which the Government of
                            the United States has learned of the views of the Government of Uruguay
                            as communicated by Dr. Guani in his memorandum of June 21, 1941.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Uruguay has once again lighted the way toward a
                            constructive and practical cooperation between all of the American
                            Republics at this moment which is more critical than any which has
                            transpired since the achievement of their independence.</p>
                        <p>A black night of fear and destruction and organized murder has engulfed
                            almost all of Europe and a great part of the rest of the world.
                            Aggression without comparison in history for its deliberately planned
                            frightfulness has annihilated the independence of one country after
                            another. The right inherent in every man and woman to worship God has
                            been ruthlessly and methodically destroyed. The cultures of centuries,
                            the cultures from which every one of the American nations has derived
                            its own national inspiration have not only been temporarily blotted out
                            but an endeavor is being made to extirpate them forever. No country
                            anywhere, today, is secure from this unmasked lust for power and loot
                            which has no limit but domination of the entire world.</p>
                        <p>In view of this situation, the Government of Uruguay addresses itself to
                            the other American Republics urging positive implementation of the
                            policy of hemisphere solidarity already unanimously adopted by the
                            American nations at previous inter-American conferences.</p>
                        <p>Uruguay recalls that its great liberator Artigas, over a hundred years
                            ago, recognized the common interests of the peoples of the Western
                            Hemisphere and suggested the undertaking of an offer of reciprocal and
                            mutual assistance. Uruguay recollects that during the World War of
                            1914–1918 it adopted, long before its general acceptance in this
                            hemisphere, the policy that any act susceptible of affecting adversely
                            the rights of any nation of the Americas should be considered as
                            constituting an offense committed against all the American nations, and
                            should bring about a uniform and common reaction.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to this policy, Uruguay declared in 1917 that it would not treat
                            as a belligerent any American country which, in defense of <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0039"/>its own rights, should find itself in a
                            state of war with nations of other continents. Finally, Uruguay recalls
                            that the policy of solidarity which it espoused twenty-five years ago
                            has now been accepted by all the other American countries in a series of
                            inter-American instruments and, therefore, inquires of the other
                            American Republics whether, in their judgment, the moment is not
                            opportune to give new content and definition to the policy of
                            inter-American solidarity.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States welcomes the opportunity afforded by
                            the initiative of the Government of Uruguay briefly to restate the
                            policies which it is presently pursuing.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the Government of the United States has considered it
                            axiomatic that the security of each of the American Republics was
                            dependent upon the security of all. It was for this simple but basic
                            reason that it wholeheartedly supported at Buenos Aires, Lima, Panama,
                            and Habana the several agreements to make inviolate the peace, security
                            and territorial integrity of the Americas.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, the President of the United States has frequently
                            declared, the last time formally before the chiefs of mission of the
                            other American Republics in Washington on May 27 last,<note n="11"

                            various American Republics provide that their harbors, ports, bases and
                            facilities will become available to the Armed Forces of the United
                            States only in case they are involved in repelling non-American
                            aggression, either by invitation of the country attacked or by a special
                            inter-American agreement.</p>
                        <p>There are no general agreements permitting the Armed Forces of the United
                            States to use the harbors or port facilities of any of the American
                            Republics under present conditions without special arrangements in each
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The strategical situation is such that our Naval Forces now engaged in
                            operations defending the Western Hemisphere should be permitted to use
                            the port facilities of a number of the American Republics, with the
                            least possible formality.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Navy Department, arrangements have been made with
                            Brazil to use the port facilities of Recife and Bahia. Negotiations are
                            now pending for using the port facilities of Natal, Maceio, Guayaquil,
                            Callao, Valparaiso, Antofagasta, and an anchorage in the Galapágos
                            Islands. As our Naval operations increase in intensity, it will be most
                            important to have available the facilities of many other ports of the
                            American Republics, both on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that broad agreements for the use of the desired ports
                            and harbors, under present international conditions, might be arranged
                            by means of a liberal interpretation of the Declaration of Uruguay,
                            recently announced by the Uruguayan Government.</p>

                        <p>Agrees with Uruguay as to the seriousness of the situation which would
                            arise should any American country be the victim of an aggression by a
                            non-continental power.</p>

                        <p>Recalls that, as far back as 1863, Argentina had recognized that a threat
                            to one American Government would be a threat to all and had stated that
                            it would be the first to seek an agreement with the other American
                            Governments to provide for the common defense and security.</p>
                        <p>But feels that the existing inter-American pacts are sufficient and that
                            the purposes of this initiative, if achieved, would in no way modify the
                            lines already laid down for the American Republics. If the spirit of
                            declarations already adopted agrees that aggression against one American
                            nation involves them all, then the duty of contributing to the common
                            defense of the continent is obviously imposed.</p>
                        <p>Argentina’s position, then, actually coincides with that of Uruguay.</p>

                            because it would make more rapidly executable, in the interests of
                            America, the rules already established by the conferences at Lima,
                            Panama, and Habana.</p>

                        <p>Considers that Resolution XV of the Habana conference fully covers the
                            situation with its statement that any attack by a non-American State on
                            the integrity or inviolability of the territory, against the sovereignty
                            or political independence of an American State shall be considered an
                            act against the States signing the declaration. The obvious consequence
                            of this is that, in case of aggression, the logical, imperative reaction
                            must be for each State to make available to the attacked State all the
                            means which may progressively <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0043"/>be
                            necessary. The language of the agreement is so unmistakable that it
                            patently not only includes the concept of not considering the attacked
                            American nation a belligerent and granting its vessels port facilities,
                            but also involves every sort of cooperation, including the extreme means
                            of action which circumstances may require.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Cuba does not feel that the second paragraph of Resolution
                            XV necessarily implies that consultation between the States can be
                            effected only by means of meetings of Foreign Ministers, nor that such
                            consultation will involve the question of what the attitude of the
                            various States is to be in the situation. That has already been decided.
                            Only tactical measures will need to be discussed. Hence, even a meeting
                            of Foreign Ministers will not necessarily involve great delays.</p>
                        <p>However, Cuba recognizes the excellent moral effect and usefulness of
                            Uruguay’s proposal, since it allows the American Republics once more to
                            reaffirm what they have already declared at Habana, with all the logical
                            consequences which that declaration implies. On its part, Cuba states
                            that it maintains all the obligations which it contracted at the Habana
                            conference and is prepared to give all cooperation for the defense of
                            the continent and the attacked State, as circumstances and the needs of
                            each case may require.</p>

                        <p>Expresses the opinion that Resolution XV of the Habana conference
                            “includes all that could be desired in the present circumstances with
                            respect to a collective defensive entente and that the faithful
                            fulfillment and normal functioning of its provisions will remove all
                            danger of attack from our nationalities.” Furthermore, the third
                            paragraph of the resolution provides possibilities for the American
                            Governments to improve its mechanism, in a gradual and progressive
                            manner, as events require or as hemispheric conditions advise.</p>
                        <p>Chile feels that there is no advantage in drawing up new agreements,
                            which would only be a repetition of those already in existence and which
                            might weaken, rather than strengthen them, and likewise that there is no
                            advantage in multiplying initiatives which might cause the countries of
                            the continent to appear divided or create doubts as to the efficacy of
                            their present agreements. It feels, further, that the meeting of Foreign
                            Ministers provided in Resolution XV will provide the occasion for each
                            Government to consider the background of the specific question and the
                            measure of its contribution to the common effort, as well as the
                            occasion to draft and adopt the measures the case requires, coordinate
                            defense and establish a rapid and efficacious plan of action. In
                            adopting this attitude, Chile believes that it is not deviating from the
                            traditional line of its international <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0044"/>policy of close solidarity and is ready to fulfill the

                        <p>The Government of Ecuador is completely in sympathy with the Pan
                            Americanist attitude of the Uruguayan Government and declares that, for
                            its part, no American country in the situation mentioned will be treated
                            by it as a belligerent.</p>
                        <p>Ecuador considers that such an attitude is the obvious consequence of
                            Resolution XV of the Habana conference, for if the American Governments
                            hold themselves to be attacked whenever any one American country is the
                            victim of an aggression, they obviously cannot treat as a belligerent an
                            American nation involved in war, in defense of its rights, with a
                            non-American power.</p>
                        <p>Ecuador feels that a declaration in this sense would constitute the
                            agreement which Uruguay has persistently sought since 1917. In fully
                            adhering to Uruguay’s views, the Ecuadoran Government states that it
                            would also like to see such a declaration “completed by others
                            regulating the situation already established by other inter-American
                            agreements, such as those relative to neutrality, security zone, etc.,
                            as well as to the concrete circumstances which the development of the

                            considered necessary, El Salvador suggests the advisability of the
                            creation of a Pan American organism of a military, financial and

                                affects each and every one of them, and justifies the initiation of

                            century-old policy of Haiti in international affairs. Further, in
                            adhering in 1937 to the principles enunciated by the American Secretary
                            of State to the effect that any situation of armed hostilities, or from
                            which armed hostilities may result, constitutes a state of fact
                            susceptible of affecting the rights and interests of all nations, Haiti

                        <p>Haiti adds that Uruguay’s apparent fear of delay in the execution of the
                            treaties intended to meet the case of an aggression would, in Haiti’s
                            opinion, be conceivable “if the attitude of the Government of the United

                            Uruguayan doctrine of American solidarity, which coincides with the <pb

                            cooperation which has ever animated the Mexican people. It is recalled
                            that, on May 17, Mexico, at the meeting of the Neutrality Committee in
                            Rio, maintained that the restrictions and limitations imposed as regards
                            the security zone should only affect non-American powers. This implied
                            the view that American countries, if at war with non-American nations,
                            should not be treated as belligerents.</p>
                        <p>Mexico, hence, accepts the Uruguayan proposal both as to the matter and
                            the procedure it suggests. As to the latter, however, it feels that
                            Resolution XV of the Habana conference provides adequate means of
                            consultation, pointing out that it does not require meetings of the
                            Foreign Ministers for matters of this kind, but permits a system of
                            direct consultation.</p>

                            approves of Uruguay’s efforts. It is of the opinion, moreover, that any
                            American State attacked by a non-American power could not be treated as
                            a belligerent. But, though it favors a practical formula for joint aid,
                            it does not believe that the present procedure of consultation should be
                            abolished. It is a procedure which has been approved at the various
                            inter-American conferences and Paraguay holds that a method so
                            sanctioned cannot be abolished by mere inquiry made of the various
                            Foreign Offices.</p>

                        <p>While willing to coordinate its opinion with that of the other States,
                            Peru holds the view that a new agreement, on the basis of the Uruguayan

                            the present conflict and the situation of each country with respect
                            thereto, etc. It feels that Resolution XV of the Habana conference is

                            from any discussion which might lead to the demonstration that a new
                            collective pronouncement on the subject is unnecessary, because the
                            “concordance of attitudes” suggested by the Uruguayan Government is
                            already provided by existing Pan American agreements. Moreover, it does
                            believe that the rapidity which would be obtained through a previously
                            agreed-upon concordant attitude is a factor of such obvious usefulness
                            in the case anticipated by the memorandum that it would fully justify

                            your letter of September 19 in which you invite my attention to the
                            opinion of the Navy Department concerning the advisability of reaching a
                            definite understanding with all of the American republics in regard to
                            the Declaration made by the Uruguayan Government on June 18, 1917 and,
                            if possible, to obtain their adherence to this declaration, in order
                            that the naval forces of the United States may utilize the port
                            facilities of these countries by simple notification of entry and
                            without restriction as to the length of these visits.</p>
                        <p>The views which you express have received the careful and sympathetic
                            consideration of this Department. In this connection you will recall
                            that on June 21, 1941 the Government of Uruguay addressed to the other
                            American republics a proposal that these republics should not consider
                            as a belligerent any one of their number which, in the defense of right,
                            should find itself in a state of war with nations of other continents.
                            This proposal reaffirms statements made on this subject by the Uruguayan
                            Government in 1917.</p>
                        <p>This Department did not fail to make known its wholehearted approval of
                            the Uruguayan proposal in a memorandum handed to the <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0048"/>Minister of Uruguay in Washington on
                            July 1 and instructed its diplomatic representatives in other American
                            republics to communicate this view to the Governments to which they were
                            accredited and to express the desirability of a favorable response. A
                            copy of this memorandum is enclosed herewith.<note n="20"

                        <p>In view of the foregoing, this Department has reached the conclusion that
                            no useful purpose would be served by endeavoring to obtain from the
                            other American republics their adherence to the Uruguayan Declaration of
                            1917. Furthermore, should the Navy Department desire to procure from the
                            other countries the necessary port facilities it would be preferable to
                            take this matter up with each country separately as has been done in the
                            case of Ecuador and Peru.</p>

                            nations and gave to each a formal note with the explanation, as I
                            understood him, that he hoped for a joint declaration of all the
                            American nations in protest against the execution of hostages in
                            France—a joint declaration and not a joint protest to the German
                            Government. The note which is long will go forward tomorrow by
                            telegraph. The substance of the note may thus be summarized.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a summation of the note the text of which is contained in
                            telegram No. 577, November 5, 9 a.m., printed <hi rend="italic"
                                >infra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>He said personally he hopes the press of the United States will support
                            this strongly.</p>
                        <p>In presenting the note Rossetti referred to a joint declaration but I
                            fail to see this clearly in the actual note. Shall see him tomorrow
                            afternoon and get this clarified. My colleagues of course are consulting
                            their Governments.</p>
                        <p>The strong language used, the direct reference to executions, impresses
                            me as a remarkably strong exposition of Chile’s position and certainly
                            calculated to concentrate attention on the barbarism being practiced, to
                            the general advantage of those opposing Hitlerism, it also bears out the
                            impressions of the author of the note as I have transmitted them to

                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>The moral and juridicial progress which the peoples of our
                                    hemisphere have attained has always inspired them to condemn all
                                    unnecessary violence and especially to welcome and adopt as
                                    their own all rules which have been formulated to mitigate the
                                    situation of the wounded, the prisoners and the civil
                                    populations.</p>
                                <p>If such rules are violated by those belligerents who, in times of
                                    peace, have participated in their formulation, the American
                                    community may not, therefore, consider them invalid nor cease to
                                    invoke them.</p>
                                <p>The American States, having incorporated these rules in their own
                                    international code on the conduct of war, wish that all nations
                                    observe them for the benefit of civilization. Chile particularly
                                    as a contracting party of the international instruments which
                                    establish them, considers that it is of positive interest that
                                    they be fulfilled in their letter and their spirit and for that
                                    reason has had them in mind in initiating these
                                    representations.</p>
                                <p>Reprisals exacted on the lives of hostages are without doubt
                                    contrary to the elemental principles of justice and humanity.
                                    They constitute a singularly anachronous immoderation of force
                                    for their practice has been abolished for centuries among
                                    Christian peoples. Nor would it be possible to accept the
                                    sacrifice of hostages as an integral element of what some
                                    doctrinaires call ‘total war’, for no American State professes
                                    this theory.</p>
                                <p>The constant efforts of the American nations in favor of such
                                    postulates of justice would be worthless if when faced by such
                                    concrete cases of violation they should not remember them to the
                                    end that they be respected but should allow them to perish
                                    amidst selfish indifference.</p>
                                <p>An opportune statement by the Governments of our continent in the
                                    form considered most effective, might lead to a moderation of
                                    the rigors of the European war in regard to the treatment of the
                                    civil populations, the prisoners and the hostages.</p>

                                <p>It cannot be supposed that the collective voice of America would
                                    be ignored or received with displeasure as it is not raised for
                                    purposes of intervention or in hostile spirit, but rather
                                    inspired by the purest humanitarian sentiments and only for the
                                    purpose of once more placing in harmony its statements and its
                                    actions.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Chile believes that it would be fitting to
                                    reaffirm the principles of humanization of war contained in the

                                    Excellency advised me that on October 24 the Government of Chile

                                    death penalty to numerous French hostages threatened with
                                    execution in reprisal for the assassination of two officials of

                                    system is revealed again in the orgy of frightfulness that has
                                    been let loose by the uncontrolled passions of desperate men in

                                    crime, are held in bondage by the Government of Germany as a
                                    means of terrorizing into submission the governments and peoples
                                    of occupied countries.</p>
                                <p>The President of the United States on October 25, the day
                                    following the representations of the Ambassador of Your
                                    Excellency’s Government at Berlin, expressed our horror,
                                    emphasizing that civilized peoples long ago adopted the basic

                                    another. A copy of the President’s statement is enclosed.”<note

                                    the abolition of reprisals on the persons of hostages, judge it
                                    necessary to insist that these diplomatic instruments, universal

                        <p>I telephoned the Chilean Ambassador<note n="13" xml:id="d35fn1">Rodolfo
                                Michels.</note> and spoke with him over the telephone about his
                            Government’s project for a joint declaration on the humanization of war
                            since the Ambassador was leaving tonight for New York and wanted to send
                            a telegram prior to his departure.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that this Government thoroughly applauded the kind
                            motives which prompted the Chilean Government. I recalled that on a
                            number of occasions, going back as far as the Spanish Civil war and
                            continuing on through the present war, this Government had made earnest
                            pleas to the belligerents to observe the rules of war as laid down in a
                            number of international conventions. Appeals based purely on
                            humanitarian considerations and not on any treaty commitments had also
                            been made. When his Government informed this Government of the
                            representations which it had made to Germany regarding the application
                            of the death penalty to French hostages this Government had sent a note,
                            through its Embassy in Santiago, expressing its support of the position
                            taken by the Government of Chile. It was evident, therefore, that this
                            Government was in full sympathy with what the Government of Chile was
                            desiring to attain.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that it was the Department’s considered view,
                            however, that this Government could not, unfortunately, associate <pb
                                n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0054"/>itself with the other American
                            Governments in an appeal to Germany for the humanization of war. Germany
                            was sinking American merchant and war ships without notice and in total
                            disregard of international law. Previous appeals to Germany to change
                            its ways had been utterly unavailing. It was, therefore, not to be
                            expected that Germany would give ear to an appeal of the American
                            countries in which the United States joined. Moreover, whatever small
                            chance the joint declaration might have would probably be jeopardized
                            were the United States to be one of the signatories.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he understood fully the position of the United
                            States; that as a matter of fact he had anticipated some such reply. He
                            went on to say that he, personally, thought that a joint declaration of
                            this character would be an expression of pious hope since Germany would
                            never give heed to the views expressed by the countries of this
                            hemisphere.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador asked that Ambassador Bowers be informed by telegram that
                            while the Government of the United States did not find itself able to

                            nature proposed by Chile with regard to the execution by Germany of
                            hostages, it nevertheless supported fully the principles maintained by
                            the Government of Chile in that regard. I said that I should be glad to

                            the repercussion of news from Greece, and the apparently general opinion
                            of my American colleagues, gained by a canvass, that important decisions
                            concerning Spanish-Axis relations will be shortly made and acted upon by
                            this Government, make me feel that it would be highly desirable that the
                            various American Republics represented here (within the limits of their
                            declared policies in the present struggle against aggression) make their
                            views known to the Spanish Government especially to the end that its
                            neutrality be maintained. And this at the earliest moment.</p>
                        <p>A military collapse in Greece or even a stalemate there would be
                            controlling and hastening factors designed for German-Spanish

                        <p>From time to time the suggestion has been advanced that the American
                            republics might address a collective statement to the Spanish <pb n="47"
                                xml:id="pg_47" facs="0057"/>Government urging upon that Government
                            the desirability of its taking no steps calculated to extend the scope
                            of the present European war. The principal objective of these proposals
                            has been to endeavor to have Spain refrain from actively assisting the
                            Axis powers. For a number of reasons it has never appeared to this
                            Government that such a collective statement would serve a useful
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>In view of the favorable attitude of other American Republics toward the
                            foregoing suggestion in the past, however, and having regard to present
                            circumstances, you are requested in your discretion to invite the
                            attention of the Argentine Foreign Minister to the possibility that his
                            Government might wish to consider an individual approach, upon its own
                            initiative, to the Spanish Government at this time. We do not feel that
                            such action would have any beneficial effect if taken by us, or upon the
                            initiative of this Government, but it is believed that if taken
                            individually by other American republics upon their own initiative it
                            might be helpful.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the approach might take the form of an informal
                            representation to the Government of Spain to the general effect that
                            Argentina, conscious of its racial and cultural bonds with Spain,
                            desires to take this opportunity of emphasizing its own adherence to the
                            principles of peace and mutual respect for sovereignty between nations
                            and its hope that Spain in the present circumstances will do nothing to
                            depart from them. The proposed message might well be concluded with a
                            concrete expression of hope that the Spanish Government will continue to
                            avoid involvement in the present war and to maintain its sovereignty and
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>A similar telegram is being sent to our missions in Peru, Colombia,
                            Venezuela, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, and Chile. Ambassador
                            Caffery is also being asked to explain this situation to the Brazilian

                        <p>170. Department’s circular telegram April 29, 10 p.m. In accordance with
                            the Department’s instructions I read a translation of the substance of
                            the Department’s telegram to Dr. Guani<note n="7" xml:id="d42fn1"
                                >Alberto Guani, Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> and
                            left with him a brief informal memorandum.</p>
                        <p>He said that Uruguayan Government had been approached twice before to
                            take a similar step, the latest being that of the British Minister a
                            month ago. Guani said that his immediate reaction was that the situation
                            in Europe had reverted to such a state of barbarism including Spain that
                            any appeal based on the grounds of bonds or law, particularly from this
                            hemisphere would now be completely without effect. I replied that
                            nevertheless in the present desperate situation it seemed wise to leave
                            no stone unturned to keep Spain out of the war, to which remark he half
                            heartedly assented saying that he would take up the matter with
                            President Baldomir whom he was seeing tonight.</p>

                        <p>395. My telegram No. 389, May 2, 2 p.m. I saw Nabuco again this evening.
                            He said that he had not yet sent the telegram to Madrid as he promised
                            he would because when he saw President Vargas this afternoon Vargas
                            raised the question as to why all of the Spanish-American Republics were
                            not making an approach to the Spanish Government on this. Vargas added
                            that if all the Spanish-American countries with diplomatic
                            representatives in Spain were making representations to the Spanish
                            Government Brazil would be glad to join them.</p>

                            Cortina, the possibility of Cuba’s addressing an informal communication

                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he believed that no harm could be done, at this
                            stage, by appealing to Spain to cooperate in the sense of taking no
                            steps which might result in extending the scope of the war, and that, on
                            the other hand, some good might possibly be accomplished. He said that
                            he liked the formula suggested by the Department and that he would
                            instruct the Cuban Chargé d’Affaires, in Madrid to address a

                            mix in Spanish affairs might open the door for Spain to interfere in the

                        <p>271. Your 395, May 2, 7 p.m. Please inform Nabuco that it is desired to
                            avoid any appearance of a collective representation to the Spanish
                            Government by all the American republics. It is hoped that the Brazilian
                            Government will consider the question on its merits and without regard
                            to whether other governments plan to take the proposed action. Obviously
                            the situations of different governments of the American republics
                            vis-à-vis the Spanish Government vary considerably. Some of them will
                            feel able to act affirmatively in the present matter while others for
                            various reasons will not wish to do so. It is my belief that any
                            statement by the Brazilian Ambassador at Madrid would be most useful in
                            the present circumstances.<note n="11" xml:id="d48fn1">In telegram No.

                        <p>74. Referring to Department’s No. 68, April 29, 10 p.m.<note n="12"

                                46</ref>.</note> I discussed this matter with the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs this morning. He is in accord with the Department’s
                            suggestion and offered to inform me of the President’s decision as soon
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Minister made a similar proposal to the governments of the other
                            American Republics last March. He read me the replies received most of
                            which raised some objection or agreed on condition that the action be
                            unanimous. The reply of Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested
                            the possibility that Spain might agree to remain neutral on condition
                            that the American Republics give a similar guarantee and pointed out
                            that it would be impossible to comply with this understanding in the
                            event that the United States entered the war. I informed the Minister
                            that it was my understanding that we were not now proposing joint action
                            and suggested the possibility that if any one country were to take the
                            lead it might prompt other governments to take similar action.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that the British Minister
                            had made a similar proposal last week.</p>

                                <p>“The Government of Colombia discreetly sounded out Spanish
                                    Government as to whether it would be agreeable to latter if the
                                    Ibero-American nations should request that Spain should preserve
                                    its neutrality in the present conflict.</p>
                                <p>The Spanish Foreign Office confidentially answered that this
                                    action would be very welcome being in harmony with the
                                    aspirations of Hispanidad but that it could not venture opinion
                                    as to the attitude Spam would assume in response to this action
                                    because of the supposition that this might favor a belligerent
                                    nation (Great Britain) and that Spain’s situation was very
                                    difficult at this moment in view of its geographical position
                                    between the frontiers of France and Portugal <pb n="52"

                                    the United States in the European war. Spain also expressed the
                                    guess that the United States might have undertaken this
                                    initiative.”</p>

                            me. It will be observed that it refers to the Ibero-American nations
                            although originally when presenting the subject I clearly specified the
                            idea of individual approach. The Minister remarked that while the
                            Spanish Foreign Office indicated it would welcome the action he knew
                            that they would attach conditions, one of them being recognition of the
                            common bonds of Hispanidad to which Colombia did not wish to tie
                            itself.</p>

                        <p>1098. The Chilean Ambassador tells me that after obtaining the approval
                            of his Government and after conference with various American colleagues
                            as well as with the British Ambassador, he is interviewing the
                            diplomatic representatives of all American countries represented here
                            with a view to inducing them to urge upon their respective Governments
                            that they be authorized to make known to <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53"
                                facs="0063"/>the Spanish Government their Government’s lively
                            interest in the maintenance of the present non-belligerency of this
                            country; in a word to exert their individual influence on Franco and his
                            Cabinet to hold Spain [to?] present policy. At the same time Spain would
                            be informed that the various American countries would endeavor to see
                            that Spain’s needs for raw materials and manufactured goods be met so
                            long as it remained outside the Axis.</p>
                        <p>I told my Chilean colleague that I thought my country desired at least
                            the maintenance of Spain’s present international attitude and I could
                            say further that we were disposed to help Spain in her economic
                            difficulties having regard to our own needs but that nothing we might do
                            must be susceptible of aid to the Axis.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador tells me that the Chilean and [apparent omission]
                            Ambassadors called together on him to tell him of the above plan and
                            that he had told them that he approved it in its general lines and that
                            he was so informing his Government.</p>
                        <p>I consider the general idea a good one since the views of the various
                            American countries along the lines indicated would have a powerful
                            effect in official circles here. I would like to be authorized to inform
                            the Chilean Ambassador of our favorable attitude toward the action being
                            taken. Representations if made would be on behalf of all the American
                            Republics represented here except the United States.</p>

                        <p>696. Your 1098, December 23, 8 p.m. The Department approves your comments
                            to the Chilean Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bowers recently requested instructions from the Department
                            with respect to the comments he should make in response to an inquiry
                            from the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs concerning the attitude of
                            this Government toward a collective appeal to the Spanish Government.
                            Ambassador Bowers was informed that the Department perceived no
                            objection to this initiative on the part of Chile, but it was suggested
                            to Ambassador Bowers that he might comment to the Chilean Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs in a friendly way that it would seem advisable to give
                            very careful thought to the matter before undertaking an appeal which,
                            since it would involve only the Spanish-American Republics as distinct
                            from the United States, Brazil and Haiti, might have an unfavorable
                            effect on the concept of complete continental solidarity. The Department
                            now understands, however, <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0064"/>that
                            all the American Republics except the United States are included in the
                            Chilean Prime Minister’s initiative.</p>
                        <p>While the Department does not believe that this Government should
                            consider participation in such an appeal or statement to the Spanish
                            Government, you are authorized to inform your Chilean colleague that
                            this Government is disposed, as always, to assist Spain in the solution
                            of its economic problems, provided satisfactory assurances are given
                            that such assistance will not be turned to the advantage of the Axis.
                            You should point out however that in the present situation the first
                            consideration in a question of economic supply must be the requirements
                            of this country, its associates in the war, and this hemisphere.</p>

                            upon the Foreign Minister and make to him the following oral

                                <p>“As the Government of . . . . . . . is aware, for some 9 months
                                    the Government of the United States has been engaged in
                                    conversations with the Japanese Government in an effort to find
                                    a peaceful solution to the problems of the Pacific. Throughout
                                    the course of these conversations the policy of the United
                                    States has been based on the principles of international law and
                                    relations to which all the American nations adhere.</p>

                                    has been subjected to acts of unprovoked aggression on the part
                                    of Japanese armed forces. These attacks were perpetrated under
                                    conditions of the most infamous treachery.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States would welcome an expression
                                    of the views of the Government of . . . . . . . in the light of
                                    these circumstances and in the light of existing inter-American

                            <p>The Foreign Minister further added that it had been decided by the

                                United States was not to be regarded as a belligerent. Mr. Armour
                                stated that on account of the necessity of securing signatures of
                                all members of the Argentine Cabinet it would probably be tomorrow
                                evening before the decree was issued.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Armour asked whether I had any comment. I said that the decree
                                was good as far as it went but it was negative rather than positive.
                                Mr. Armour stated that he had urged upon the Foreign Minister that
                                the decree be accompanied by a declaration of solidarity. The
                                Foreign Minister argued that the references to the appropriate
                                resolutions of Lima and Habana took care of that.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that Ruiz-Guiñazu had asked his opinion with
                                regard to the Japanese inquiry as to whether Argentina would
                                represent Japanese interests in the United States, Great Britain,
                                and Canada. Dr. Ruiz-Guiñazu stated that if Argentina answered
                                favorably to the Japanese Government it would be with the
                                reservation that its acceptance was conditioned upon compliance with
                                the international commitments which Argentina undertook at the
                                meeting of Foreign Ministers in Habana.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Armour stated that he had replied to Dr. Ruiz-Guiñazu informally
                                and personally that it looked to him as though this inquiry of the
                                Japanese might be a maneuver to put Argentina in an embarrassing
                                position and break the inter-American front. Moreover, it might put
                                Argentina in an extremely difficult position if the American
                                Republics were to decide on some joint action which would be
                                inconsistent with Argentina’s handling of Japanese interests.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Armour asked my comment. I told him that I thought that it would
                                be exceedingly unfortunate. Mr. Armour thought that the British had
                                made a prime mistake in asking Argentina to handle British interests
                                in Japan It was difficult now for Argentina to decline to represent
                                Japanese interests in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States.
                                Mr. Armour did not know whether the Argentine attitude would be
                                changed by the British requesting some other country to handle its
                                interests, but he suggested that the Department consider this
                                possibility.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Ruiz-Guiñazu told Mr. Armour that he would be glad to have the
                                informal advice of this Government. Mr. Armour hoped that he could
                                give him this either later this evening or the first thing tomorrow
                                morning.</p>

                                    with the other American countries, since this case relates to an

                                        profoundly appreciated by the Government of the United
                                        States, and I am sure that the sincere good wishes of the
                                        great nation of Argentina will be particularly encouraging
                                        to the American people in this hour when they have been
                                        subjected to treacherous aggression. As Your Excellency so
                                        well states, this unprovoked attack from a non-American
                                        nation must affect all of America as a whole. The solidarity
                                        of the nations of this hemisphere is, however, an invincible
                                        bulwark for the unstinting war effort of the United States,
                                        and of those sister Republics which are now at war. Your
                                        Excellency may be sure that the Government of the United
                                        States is deeply grateful for such practical cooperative
                                        measures already taken by Your Excellency’s Government in

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                                outbreak of war between the United States and the Axis powers has
                                created a pronounced reaction in Argentina in favor of the United
                                States. The fact that war came as a result of Japanese aggression,
                                and particularly the treacherous nature of that aggression, has
                                undoubtedly been a principal factor in the exceptionally strong
                                reaction which has made itself manifest in all levels of Argentine
                                society.</p>
                            <p>I have already had occasion to refer in various telegrams to the
                                reaction of the press, which, excepting of course such pro-Nazi
                                organs as <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi>, has been decidedly
                                outspoken in support of the United States and in favor of full
                                cooperation by Argentina in the common task of defending America.
                                The Department is also, of course, aware of the personal messages
                                addressed to President Roosevelt by the Acting President, by
                                President Ortiz, and by such prominent Argentines <pb n="64"
                                    xml:id="pg_64" facs="0074"/>as former Presidents Dr. Marcelo T.
                                de Alvear and General Agustín P. Justo, the President of the
                                “Círculo de la Prensa”, Jorge Artayeta, and the well-known lawyer,
                                Angel Sánchez Elía. General Justo also called in person at my
                                office.</p>
                            <p>I believe that the Department will be interested to know that since
                                the Japanese aggression on December 7 the Embassy has received
                                literally hundreds of messages of friendship, encouragement and
                                support from people in every walk of life in this country. Many of
                                these messages have been delivered to me personally, others have
                                been received in letters and telegrams. The sentiments expressed in
                                all of them have been the same: horror and disgust at the
                                treacherous Japanese attack, expressions of friendship and
                                solidarity toward the United States, and frequently offers of
                                personal cooperation in any way possible.</p>
                            <p>Among the distinguished Argentines from whom messages have been
                                received, in addition to those already noted, I may mention
                                Monsignor Franceschi, who called the day following the Japanese
                                attack; Dr. Julio A. Roca, who called personally at my residence;

                                members of the delegation of Argentine Deputies who have recently
                                returned from the United States, all of whom have called upon me
                                within the last few days; Dr. Enrique Gil; Dr. Guillermo E.

                                of Finance, Dr. Acevedo. Expressions of solidarity and support for
                                the United States have come from the owners and editors of the
                                leading newspapers of Buenos Aires and a number of provincial
                                cities; from officials of the Foreign Office and other Government
                                Ministries; from the clergy; from cultural, professional, artistic

                                from officers of the Army and Navy. To all of these spontaneous
                                messages of friendship and support, I have sought to give a prompt
                                and adequate response.</p>
                            <p>There are a number of features of particular significance worth
                                noting in connection with this unusual demonstration of solidarity
                                and friendship with the United States.</p>

                                <item>Immediately after the Japanese aggression, the Embassy began
                                    to receive a considerable number of inquiries from persons
                                    desiring to enlist in the armed forces of the United States.
                                    Other inquiries have been received regarding the possibility of
                                    serving as technicians in one capacity or another in our war
                                    industries.</item>

                                <item>The attitude of Argentine Army, Navy, and Air Force officers
                                    in general seems to have undergone a transformation. The
                                    Military and Taval Attachés of the Embassy as well as the Chief
                                    of our Military Air Mission, Lieutenant Colonel Deerwester, and
                                    of our Special Naval Mission, Captain Metz, have all been
                                    impressed by the numerous manifestations of solidarity which
                                    they have received. Captain Metz, who is acting as advisor at
                                    the Naval War College, reports that 7 of the 17 members of the
                                    staff and student officers of the War College have personally
                                    expressed to him their enthusiastic support of the United
                                    States. The attitude of the members as a whole, with the
                                    exception of one officer notoriously pro-Nazi, has undergone a
                                    radical change in favor of United States. Lieutenant Colonel
                                    Deerwester has submitted a memorandum to me describing the
                                    reactions which he has observed among the officers of the
                                    Argentine Army Air Force following the Japanese attack upon the
                                    United States, which indicates a similar trend. A copy of this
                                    memorandum is enclosed.<note n="17" xml:id="d65fn1">Not

                                <item>The attitude of Monsignor Franceschi is highly significant in
                                    view of his position and influence in Church circles. Monsignor
                                    Franceschi telephoned on the morning of December 8 to express
                                    his sincerest regrets and sympathy at the aggression directed
                                    against the United States by Japan, and to wish us every success
                                    in the task that lies before us. (As stated above, he also
                                    called on me later when he expressed the same sentiments in
                                    person.) In the weekly edition of the Catholic review <hi
                                        rend="italic">Criterio</hi> on December 11, there appeared a
                                    leading article by Monsignor Franceschi entitled “The Japanese
                                    Aggression”, which is particularly important. Copies of this
                                    edition of <hi rend="italic">Criterio</hi> are enclosed.<note
                                        n="17" xml:id="d65fn2">Not printed.</note> As the Department
                                    is aware, Monsignor Franceschi recently accepted an invitation
                                    from the National Catholic Welfare Council to visit the United
                                    States next spring. (Cf. despatch No. 3573, November 27,

                                <item>The popular attitude is graphically illustrated by that
                                    observed by a member of my staff in several of the leading
                                    coffee shops of Buenos Aires on the evening of December 8. In
                                    each of these the national anthems of the United States, Great
                                    Britain and Argentina were played by the orchestras to the
                                    accompaniment of loud cheers and cries of “Viva los Aliados”.
                                    The playing of the Argentine national anthem in coffee shops is
                                    itself rare except on national holidays.</item>

                                <item>The attitude of the conservative elements in the country,
                                    which as a whole has been the least sympathetic to the
                                    democratic cause and most favorable to the application of
                                    totalitarian methods in Argentina, apparently has been altered
                                    to some extent. This is indicated by the messages which have
                                    been received from prominent conservatives such as the President
                                    of the Senate, Dr. Patrón Costas, who in the past has not been
                                    regarded as particularly friendly toward the United
                                    States.</item>

                            <p>I am enclosing a memorandum<note n="18" xml:id="d65fn4">Not
                                    printed.</note> of an interesting conversation which I had with
                                Admiral Guizazola, Chief of the Naval General Staff, at a luncheon
                                today at the Naval War College, which casts some further light on
                                the attitude of Argentine Naval Officers toward the war between the
                                United States and Japan.</p>
                            <p>As already indicated at the beginning of this despatch, the fact that
                                it was Japan, rather than Germany or Italy, which attacked the
                                United States, together with the infamous manner of the attack, has
                                undoubtedly been a principal factor in the strong reaction in favor
                                of the United States observed in Argentina. With the declaration of
                                war by Germany and Italy against the United States, some cooling off
                                in Argentine enthusiasm for our cause may be expected, and has
                                indeed already been observed. Nevertheless, the views expressed by
                                Monsignor Franceschi in his article in the enclosed copy of <hi
                                    rend="italic">Criterio</hi>, may be taken as an encouraging
                                indication of a growing appreciation on the part of conservative
                                elements in Argentina that no distinction can be made between the
                                methods or aims of the different members of the Axis.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Supplementing my recent telegrams and
                                telephone conversations with Mr. Duggan, I have the honor to inform
                                the Department that the position of the Argentine Government at this
                                moment, and with particular reference to the forthcoming conference
                                of American Foreign Ministers in Río de Janeiro, is in considerable
                                doubt. An analysis of developments during the past two weeks may be
                                useful in arriving at some idea of the actual situation, although it
                                would be premature and hazardous to venture any definite prediction
                                of the attitude that this Government may finally adopt. Obviously
                                the decision of the Argentine Government in this respect will depend
                                upon a variety of factors, not least of which will be the degree of
                                solidarity that may be manifested by the other American Republics
                                during the next few crucial weeks.</p>
                            <p>The action of the Argentine Government in issuing the decrees of
                                December 9 and 13, 1941, whereby it was declared that the United
                                States would not be considered as a belligerent in the war with
                                Japan, Germany and Italy, was accepted at the time as an indication
                                of an intention on the part of this Government to cooperate with us
                                and <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0077"/>with the other countries
                                of this hemisphere in the common task of continental defense.
                                (Reference Embassy’s telegrams nos. 1411 of December 9, 10 P.M., and
                                1457 of December 13, 2 P.M.) This belief was strengthened by the
                                action of the Acting President, Dr. Castillo, in sending a personal
                                message to President Roosevelt on December 9, in which he concluded
                                with an expression of the friendship of the Argentine Government and
                                people. This action appeared particularly significant in that it was
                                the first time that Dr. Castillo had seen fit to address such a
                                message to the President of the United States.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>On December 16 the Government issued a decree proclaiming a state of
                                siege throughout the Republic. On the basis of this decree, as
                                reported in my telegrams Nos. 1492 of December 17, 12 noon, and 1516
                                of December 20, 3 p.m.,<note n="19" xml:id="d66fn1">Latter not
                                    printed.</note> the police authorities have been instructed not
                                to permit the holding of public assemblies, or to permit the
                                publication in the press of any articles or comment which can be
                                construed as critical of the Government’s international policy,
                                which “may affect the neutrality of Argentina toward other nations
                                in conflict”, or which may tend to disturb internal order.</p>
                            <p>The decision of the Government to impose a state of siege was
                                foreshadowed in an exclusive interview which the Acting President
                                gave to <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> on December 15, and which
                                was published in three columns on the front page. It would appear
                                that in granting this interview Dr. Castillo was seeking to justify
                                a state of siege in advance, and to make it more acceptable to the
                                country, on the ground that the Government required this additional
                                power in order to carry out quickly and effectively the
                                international obligations which it had assumed through declaring
                                that it would not consider the United States as a belligerent in the
                                present war. According to the account of the interview as published
                                by <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi>, the Acting President went so far
                                as to say that “The Executive Power considers that the propaganda
                                which is being carried on in favor of the countries which are at war
                                with the United States should cease, because, if it should not
                                cease, one would be engaging in a flagrant violation of the very
                                decree of non-belligerency (of the United States)”.</p>
                            <p>Any belief that the state of siege would be used by the Government
                                primarily to squelch pro-totalitarian propaganda and subversive
                                activities, that may have been created by the Acting President’s
                                declarations on December 15, has been dissipated by the events which
                                have followed. The preamble of the decree itself mentions the
                                necessity of strengthening the moral unity of the nation in order to
                                maintain fully and effectively the position adopted by Argentina
                                toward the war, and also mentions the obligations imposed by Pan
                                American <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0078"/>undertakings which
                                can not effectively be carried out within the limits of the
                                constitutional guarantees intended for normal times. This portion of
                                the preamble, however, includes a clause referring to the necessity
                                for safeguarding neutrality, which in itself is hardly consonant
                                with the idea of cooperation for continental defense against
                                totalitarian aggression. (According to the Under Secretary of the
                                Interior, this reference to neutrality was inserted by the Minister
                                of Foreign Affairs after the decree had been prepared by the
                                Ministry of the Interior.) Aside from this, the preamble
                                specifically refers to the necessity of suppressing “all activity
                                tending to increase the passions aroused by the war which in
                                disturbing public order may endanger public tranquillity by
                                subversive appeals or undesirable methods of expression”.</p>
                            <p>It may be noted that the action of the Government in proclaiming a
                                state of siege throughout the Republic is based upon the authority
                                conferred by Article 23 and paragraph 19 of Article 86 of the
                                Constitution. The provisions of the Constitution authorize the
                                declaration of a state of siege “in the event of internal disorder
                                or external attack”. In the present instance the Government has
                                declared a state of siege in the absence of either of these
                                conditions, asserting in the preamble to the decree of December 16
                                that “the suspension of certain guarantees of this kind may be
                                decided upon as a preventive measure”. It may be observed
                                furthermore that Article 86, paragraph 19, provides that a state of
                                siege may be declared only for a limited period, whereas the present
                                decree specifies no time limit.</p>
                            <p>In actual practice thus far the application of the restrictive
                                measures against public assemblies and the press has operated to
                                prevent public expressions of support for the United States on the
                                part of the large majority of the press and public which favor the
                                democratic cause. Even if similar restrictions are enforced against
                                pro-totalitarian organs, as the Minister of the Interior has
                                asserted to me is the case, the ultimate effect is, nevertheless, to
                                muzzle public expression and to weaken the general demand upon the
                                Government for a more open and energetic collaboration by Argentina
                                with the United States and other American countries against all
                                forms of totalitarian aggression. As reported in my telegram No.
                                1493 of December 17, 10 p.m.<note n="20" xml:id="d66fn2">Not

                                scheduled for last Saturday in homage to President Roosevelt, at
                                which I had expected to read the President’s message of
                                appreciation, was suspended without further public explanation than
                                that it could not be held under the existing state of siege. I am
                                submitting a full report of this incident by separate despatch.</p>
                            <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0079"/>
                            <p>While there is some difference of opinion in political and other
                                circles regarding all of the considerations which may have played a
                                part in determining the Government to invoke a state of siege at
                                this time, there is general agreement that the principal objective
                                is to assure firmer control of the internal political situation.
                                Developments in recent weeks suggest the growing unpopularity of the
                                Government and a constant narrowing of the basis of support upon
                                which it can rely.…</p>
                            <p>The position of President Ortiz may have been a factor in the
                                decision of the Government to declare a state of siege at this time.
                                Various members of the Radical Party have told me in recent weeks
                                that pressure was being brought to bear upon the President by
                                various persons to persuade him to return to power. Honorio
                                    Pueyrredon<note n="21" xml:id="d66fn3">Head of the Radical
                                    Party.</note> told me that he had urged the President to do so
                                for the sake of the Party, regardless of the state of his health,
                                and that Ortiz had asked for 48 hours to think the matter over.
                                Another story, which comes from a source very close to General Justo
                                and may have a basis in fact, is that the President has been
                                considering the idea of submitting his formal resignation from
                                office, thereby forcing the calling of the Congress into session to
                                consider it. If this report is true it would explain the
                                Government’s haste in declaring a state of siege in order to avoid
                                the necessity of convening the Congress. (President Ortiz’ comments
                                regarding the policy of the Government are reported in my strictly
                                confidential despatch No. 3725 of December 19, 1941.<note n="22"
                                    xml:id="d66fn4">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                            <p>The position of General Agustín P. Justo may also have been a factor
                                in the Government’s decision, particularly since the General made
                                such a public display of solidarity with us after December 7.
                                Reports of dissension within the Cabinet, which have circulated in
                                recent weeks, have usually involved the names of the two Ministers
                                generally considered to be followers of Justo—Culaciati and General
                                Tonazzi—and the rumor has been that efforts were being made to force
                                them out. The latest rumor of this kind was given publicity last
                                week by the evening newspaper <hi rend="italic">Noticias
                                    Gráficas</hi>, which suggested that the Acting President
                                intended to reorganize the Cabinet, including the elimination of
                                these two Ministers and the reshufflement of other portfolios, with
                                the view to strengthening his own personal control of the
                                Government. This report was denied to me by the Under Secretary of
                                the Interior, Dr. Castells, who insisted that there was nothing to
                                it. On the other hand, my British colleague tells me that he has
                                received information from a source close to Culaciati to the effect
                                that the latter actually handed in his resignation recently, but
                                that it was turned down by <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0080"
                                />Dr. Castillo. Whatever the exact truth may be, it appears evident
                                that the imposition of the state of siege has also served to close
                                down the channels of publicity which General Justo has been using to
                                promote his campaign for the Presidency in 1943.</p>
                            <p>An element in the internal situation which is, of course,
                                particularly disturbing, and which it is not possible to gauge with
                                accuracy at this time, is the extent of the influence in the
                                Government of various groups known to have pro-totalitarian
                                sympathies. …</p>
                            <p>The extent of the influence of the foregoing elements in the present
                                Government can not, as I have already remarked, be accurately gauged
                                at this time; but there is little doubt that such influence exists
                                and is making itself felt. …</p>
                            <p>A number of reports have come to me of what transpired at the Cabinet
                                meeting last evening which serve only to strengthen the impression
                                that the Government intends to do nothing more in the direction of
                                full collaboration with us unless and until it feels compelled to do
                                so. The meeting of the Cabinet had been announced as for the purpose
                                of deciding the position to be adopted by the Government at the
                                forthcoming conference at Río de Janeiro. After the session the
                                Acting President informed the press that the Foreign Minister had
                                presented a report on the principal points of the agenda for the Río
                                conference, with a view to determining the policy to be followed by
                                the Argentine delegation; that several remaining points would be
                                considered at a further Cabinet meeting next Tuesday; and that it
                                had been decided to extend the present budget with certain minor
                                changes for the year 1942. At the same time a decree was made public
                                announcing the membership of the Argentine delegation to the
                                forthcoming conference, which had already been made public by the
                                Foreign Office several days earlier. (Embassy telegram No. 1517 of
                                December 20, 3 p.m.<note n="23" xml:id="d66fn5">Not printed.</note>)
                                According to the information which I have received, the Foreign
                                Minister’s statement at yesterday’s session of the Cabinet consisted
                                essentially of an argument against any closer cooperation with us
                                and in favor of maintaining the strictest possible neutrality. As a
                                result, the Cabinet postponed reaching a decision despite the fact
                                that a majority of the Ministers are said to have favored adoption
                                of a fairly strong position which would have been made the basis of
                                a statement in support of continental solidarity.</p>
                            <p>A Conservative point of view which should not be overlooked is one
                                that has been reflected in recent days in the comments of various
                                members of the Conservative group to which Castillo belongs. This is
                                to the effect that they are well satisfied with the manner in which
                                Argentina is living up to its Inter-American commitments, and resent

                                that the Government will continue to follow a day to day policy of
                                procrastination and evasion, and will be influenced in its final
                                decision with regard to the commitments to be undertaken at Río de

                                circular of December 7, 4 p.m.</p>
                            <p>From questions which Minister asked concerning attitude of other
                                American Republics, it seems probable Bolivia will await action of
                                neighboring countries before deciding how far its “cooperation” will
                                go. President and Cabinet officers have canceled trip scheduled to
                                southern Bolivia because of international situation.</p>
                            <p>The two pro-democratic newspapers have published strong editorials
                                supporting the United States but others have not yet commented.
                                Legation has received numerous expressions of sympathy, offers to
                                volunteer, et cetera. Public opinion is mostly with us on our
                                feeling, is superficial and based largely on fact of Bolivian
                                economic dependence on the United States.</p>

                            <p>1945. My telegram number 1935, December 8, 1 p.m. Aranha tells me
                                that every member of the Cabinet, and especially the Minister of
                                    War<note n="27" xml:id="d71fn1">Gen. Pedro A. Góes
                                    Monteiro.</note>, was very open and very decided in their
                                pro-United States attitude at the Cabinet meeting. Góes Monteiro
                                came to see him immediately thereafter and said that it was up to
                                him (Góes) to show by action that he was more pro-United States than
                                the others; he wants only the chance to do so he said.</p>
                            <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0084"/>
                            <p>Aranha says the Government will take energetic steps at once to
                                control the internal situation. They realize that they will probably
                                meet at least with sabotage in various parts of the country.</p>
                            <p>Aranha has been calling in all of the Latin American representatives
                                here this afternoon and giving them pep talks. I heard him tell them
                                that an attack on the United States was an attack on all the
                                Americas; that Brazil has taken only the first steps and that there
                                are any number of other steps to come; that he, Aranha, believes
                                that it is worthwhile making the attempt to get unanimity of action
                                in all the Americas for these steps: if unanimity is not achieved
                                near unanimity probably will be. He talked very seriously and very
                                competently to them setting the point of view that this is the fight
                                of all the Americas. He asked them all to communicate these views to
                                their home governments. …</p>
                            <p>He told them of the Department’s proposal for a meeting of the
                                Ministers of Foreign Affairs. He told them that he highly approved
                                and would approve holding the meeting here in Rio as set out by the
                                last Habana Conference. He said that he had suggested to Washington
                                that the United States, as the nation which has suffered the
                                aggression, do the inviting.</p>

                                message from his Government, part of which he proceeded to convey to
                                me and the remainder of which he said he would like to deliver to
                                the Under Secretary personally, tomorrow morning if possible. He
                                said that the matters he desired to discuss with the Under Secretary
                                included certain questions relating to continental defense and
                                others which he would prefer not to discuss on the telephone.</p>
                            <p>The Chilean Ambassador stated that his Government had directed him to
                                report to the Department of State that all measures have been taken
                                to protect mines, industries and so forth belonging to the United
                                States nationals and that the United States Government may be sure
                                that all precautions will be taken to secure the production and
                                furnishing of supplies of strategic materials. He said that as soon
                                as his Government received today’s news it met with the President
                                and took these decisions.</p>

                            <p>The Chilean Ambassador stated further that the Chilean Government
                                remains very friendly to the United States.</p>
                            <p>I thanked the Ambassador for his message and said I would immediately
                                report to the Under Secretary’s office the Ambassador’s desire for
                                an appointment tomorrow.</p>

                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> this morning. He promised a
                                public statement some time this afternoon on Chile’s position but
                                authorized me to inform you that Chile is in absolute accord with
                                the United States and will fulfill its agreements as to the common
                                continental defense to the fullest extent. He says there are about
                                700 Japanese in Chile some in Santiago and Valparaiso and some in
                                the north and that these are now being very closely watched. The
                                plans for the protection of mines et cetera against sabotage had
                                been worked out in detail before and have now been put into effect
                                fully.</p>
                            <p>He goes to Mendoza this week to meet the Argentine Minister and sign
                                the protocol for fortification of the Straits. The material now here
                                was sent to that region while negotiations were still on and in
                                anticipation of their success. He says in the conversations at
                                Mendoza he proposes to try to wean Argentina away from her present
                                semi-hostile neutrality and to persuade both Argentina and Peru to
                                come out strongly with Chile and Brazil.</p>

                            <p>752. For the Secretary and Under Secretary. Rossetti gave me a
                                confidential intimate description of situation confronting the
                                Government and particularly himself growing out of position he has
                                so far with the Japanese aggression. His greatest difficulty grows
                                out of the actual and acute fear of many men in Congress and in
                                armed forces (shared by the public) that the Chilean coast may be
                                attacked and the unverified reports that Japanese airplane carriers
                                and vessels are off the Chilean coast. His foes, and ours, attack as
                                having provoked trouble with Japan when he knows Chile cannot alone
                                meet an aggression and without any authentic assurances that we
                                would come to her assistance if attacked. And men of good faith, he
                                says, while agreeable to his policy are fearful and eager to be
                                assured that we have promised assistance. In Congress he has
                                prevailed after hard battles but the Nazis, Fascists, and Falangists
                                and Japanese are now concentrating their fire on him and his
                                pro-American policy. He is most nervous because men of good faith in
                                army are worried lest Chile, attacked, would not have our support.
                                This afternoon he is seeing ranking army officers one by one to
                                reassure them.</p>
                            <p>In the event of an attack from Japanese, he feels that … he must have
                                a signed protocol for secret use if necessary in which we agree to
                                support Chile if attacked by any nation outside this hemisphere. He
                                gives me the impression Welles has told Michels he is agreeable. He
                                begs that this be given by Wednesday<note n="32" xml:id="d76fn1"
                                    >December 17.</note> morning, to be signed here, and predated
                                October 23, 1941. … Since we have had such an agreement for more

                                confronts him personally as well as his Government. However, both
                                the President of the United States and this Government have given so
                                many unequivocal assurances of an intention to come to the
                                assistance of any nation of the Western Hemisphere which may be the
                                victim of foreign aggression that it does not seem desirable to
                                supplement those assurances with a secret protocol of the type
                                described by Rossetti. The existence of such a protocol in the case
                                of Chile alone would obviously be incompatible with the system of
                                continental solidarity. Nor would it seem appropriate to sign such a
                                protocol with Chile when no such special and individual agreements
                                exist in the case of those nations which have unhesitatingly
                                declared war upon the Axis powers.<note n="34" xml:id="d77fn1">For

                                assistance to Chile which is contained in the record of the staff
                                conversations between Chilean and United States officers, a copy of
                                which is on file in your Embassy (see Tab B entitled “United States
                                Promise of Assistance to Chile”). This communication may obviously
                                be dated at any time which will suit Rossetti’s convenience provided
                                of course it is not prior to the date of the staff
                                conversations.</p>
                            <p>Please assure Rossetti that the very great strategic importance of
                                Chile from the point of view not only of hemispheric defense as a
                                whole but also from that of the maintenance of United States defense
                                industries is fully appreciated here. [Welles.]</p>

                                    of American solidarity, has formulated declarations of adherence

                            <p>The Colombian Ambassador called to see me this afternoon at my
                                request. I told the Ambassador that I wanted to speak with him in a
                                very unofficial and friendly way. I said the effect on public
                                opinion in this country, as well as upon the Government, of the
                                splendid cooperative action taken by his Government with regard to
                                Japan had been, as he undoubtedly knew, overwhelmingly favorable and
                                I didn’t want anything to happen that would detract in the slightest
                                degree from that happy result. I said that if the Government of
                                Colombia <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0091"/>speedily took action
                                to sever relations with Germany and Italy, the beneficial effect
                                which I had mentioned would be greatly enhanced and it would also
                                constitute a great relief to our War and Navy Departments.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said he was in the happy position of being able to
                                give me an immediate reply. He said that he had just finished
                                talking on the long distance telephone with President Santos and the
                                latter had explained to him that the Congress was now completing the
                                final stages of granting the executive full powers short of a
                                declaration of war. He said the final vote would probably take place
                                tomorrow. He said further that the only reason for the delay in
                                breaking diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy was to give the
                                Government a little more time to take precautionary measures with
                                regard to the German and Italian colonies in Colombia before the
                                public knew of the rupture of relations. He said he could give me
                                almost definite assurances that the severance of relations would
                                take place not later than Monday. I asked the Ambassador to express
                                to the President my deep appreciation of this new proof of the
                                unfailing cooperation and support of the Colombian Government.</p>

                            <p>685. In radio speech last night President Santos said that never had
                                a Colombian President had to speak to his fellow citizens at a time
                                so grave and serious for all humanity, that Colombia has the moral
                                obligation to assume a definite attitude, “The declarations of
                                principle of Lima and Buenos Aires, the policy defined in these Pan
                                American Conferences and in Habana and in Panama have not been the
                                artificial work of politicians but the almost spontaneous result of
                                what has been and is American and what it must be.”</p>
                            <p>He followed with a statement that in the aggression of Japan, Germany
                                and Italy against the United States “Colombia is neither indifferent
                                nor neutral” and added that Colombia would fulfill its role in the
                                policy of continental solidarity.</p>
                            <p>He pointed out that Colombia is not a military power and would not
                                declare war on anyone unless it should be invaded but that it would
                                have to work to the limit of its resources and “to fight on the side
                                of our allies”. He continued that he had absolute faith in the
                                United States and that Colombia would follow the letter and the
                                spirit of the norms which determine Pan American solidarity and
                                which guarantee <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0092"/>the liberty
                                and sovereignty of the continent. President Santos said that there
                                could be no doubt of Colombia’s intention to cooperate in the
                                defense of the continent and the security of the Canal. With
                                reference to Germany and Italy he said “Las leyes de la lógica están
                                exigiendo que si rompimos relaciones diplomáticas y consulares con
                                el Japón por su agresión contra los Estados Unidos y al hacerlo no
                                hicimos otra cosa que cumplir una disposición terminante de un
                                acuerdo de la Habana ratificado por el parlamento Colombiano
                                observamos actitud paralela con los gobiernos de Alemania e Italia
                                que se solidarizaron con el Japón y lo acompañan en la guerra
                                declarada al gobierno y pueblo de los Estados Unidos. En uno y otro
                                caso nuestra actitud tiene que ser idéntica.”<note n="40"
                                    xml:id="d82fn1">Translation: “The laws of logic require that if
                                    we break diplomatic relations with Japan because of her
                                    aggression against the United States and in doing so we do no
                                    more than fulfill a positive provision of the Habana Agreement
                                    ratified by the Colombian Parliament, we observe an attitude
                                    similar to that of the Governments of Germany and Italy which
                                    allied themselves with Japan and accompanied her into war
                                    declared against the Government and people of the United States.
                                    In any case our attitude must be identical.”</note> There then
                                followed “Neustro rompimiento de relaciones diplomáticas y

                                    powers who reside in Colombia.”</note> and the President
                                continued that Colombia would have to take extremely severe measures
                                to prevent all propaganda and all activities contrary to American
                                solidarity adding that it would not cavilate in anything with

                                of its obligations.</p>

                            <p>369. The Minister for Foreign Affairs convoked the Diplomatic Corps
                                at 9 p.m. today with the exception of the Italian Minister and
                                German Chargé d’Affaires who were advised at their homes regarding
                                the purpose of the meeting. Minister Echandi informed the Corps that
                                an extraordinary session of Congress has been called for 7 a.m.
                                tomorrow at which the Government will propose that a state of war be
                                declared against Japan and against any other non-American power
                                which may commit an act of aggression against the continent.
                                Congress also will be requested to give permission for military or
                                naval forces of the United States to enter Costa Rican territory for
                                any purpose whatever connected with the defense of the continent.
                                Congress will likewise be requested in accordance with article 73 of
                                the Constitution to declare a state of emergency giving the
                                Government extraordinary powers. Echandi said that other Central
                                American Governments and Panamanian Government are being consulted
                                with a view to reaching complete solidarity. Echandi said that steps
                                taken indicate Government desire to give all possible assistance to
                                the United States at this critical moment.</p>

                                p.m. I called on the Minister of State<note n="44a" xml:id="d88fn1"
                                    >José M. Cortina.</note> at noon today and conveyed to him the
                                oral communication as instructed.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that the Cuban Government considered the
                                dastardly and unprovoked attack made by the Japanese armed forces on
                                our territory and people as an attack against Cuba and as against
                                every one of the American states.</p>
                            <p>The Cuban Government considered the unprovoked attack on us by Japan
                                as calling for an immediate declaration of war on the part of Cuba
                                against Japan. While this was Cuba’s obligation under the
                                inter-American agreements, particularly that of Habana, the
                                Government of Cuba because of its traditional relationships of close
                                amity and cooperation with the United States would proceed with the
                                declaration of war even if such conventions did not exist.</p>
                            <p>The President of Cuba was preparing today a message to the Congress
                                and the declaration of war would be voted either today or tomorrow
                                by the Congress.<note n="45" xml:id="d88fn2">Cuba declared war on
                                    Japan on December 9, 1941, and on Germany and Italy December 11,
                                    1941.</note></p>
                            <p>The Minister went on to say that the Council of Ministers had also
                                decided to send in the name of the Cuban Government to President
                                Roosevelt a message pledging the full support of Cuba to the United
                                States in every degree and manner in her power.</p>
                            <p>He further stated that the Council of Ministers had decided to send
                                in the name of the Cuban Government a message to the Governments of
                                the other American republics urging that immediate steps be taken by
                                all to show the complete solidarity of the continent and complete
                                cooperation with the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is likely that the actual declaration of war will not be voted by
                                the Congress until tomorrow as the message and other documents are
                                in preparation. The Minister informed me however that the passports
                                of the Japanese Chargé and staff were already under preparation.</p>
                            <p>There is no question that the Government’s action in calling for a
                                declaration of war has the support of all parties and all sectors of
                                the Cuban population.</p>

                            <p>In view of the contemptible aggression which the armed forces of
                                Japan have made upon territory of the United States without prior
                                notice or provocation, and while Your Excellency was seeking a
                                pacific solution of the pending problems, I have the honor to
                                express to you the most absolute compenetration [<hi rend="italic"

                                United States in the existing war. We consider that this aggression

                                of the territory of an American State is the case foreseen in the
                                Fifteenth Declaration of the Habana Conference by virtue of which
                                all the nations of the Continent should also consider themselves the
                                subject of aggression in the same way and they must react thereto in

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the
                                Department events have moved so swiftly in the past few days that it
                                has seemed somewhat superfluous to attempt to write a detailed
                                report by despatch of each event as it occurred. The Department was
                                advised promptly of the circumstances attendant to the declaration
                                of war against Japan by the Dominican Government. The Department may
                                be interested to know, however, that this declaration of war was not
                                merely a gesture on the part of the regime now in power, but that it
                                really received the spontaneous approval of all sections of public
                                opinion here, including the man on the street. The sentiment of
                                Dominicans of all classes has been very sincerely one of indignation
                                at the treacherous initial attack of the Japanese, and I have had
                                innumerable expressions of sympathy and offers of cooperation from
                                Dominicans of all classes.</p>
                            <p>The officials of the Government have showed a spirit, not only of
                                willingness, but of desire to cooperate with our Government and with
                                this Legation and to carry out any measures relating to defense
                                which we may suggest. The Legation has furnished the proper
                                authorities with a complete list of Germans and Italians on our
                                suspect list, and <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0098"/>only this

                                    476.</note> last night, and in view of the reports published in
                                the press that authorities in the United States have begun to round
                                up suspected persons, not only of Japanese but of German and Italian
                                nationality as well, the Dominican authorities will immediately, as
                                a preventive measure, take into custody and place in concentration
                                camps all of those persons referred to above. The Department will
                                realize that there are large numbers of Jewish refugees here of
                                German nationality, and that, up to the present at least, it does
                                not seem to be necessary for this Government to take any measures
                                against these unfortunate people, excepting to keep them under very
                                close surveillance. As an additional measure of precaution, I called
                                this morning a meeting of the representatives of the principal
                                American firms here which, of course, included the representatives
                                of the petroleum companies, the Electric Light Company, et cetera. I
                                explained to this group that measures which might have seemed
                                fantastic even a few days ago now constitute a pressing problem, and
                                I referred especially to the necessity for defense against possible
                                acts of sabotage. The problem of each company was discussed, and it
                                was decided that the Military and Naval Attachés, accompanied by
                                representatives of the oil companies and the Electric Light Company,
                                would immediately see General Hector Trujillo, Chief of the General
                                Staff, and arrange for adequate guards to be placed at the most
                                vulnerable points belonging to those companies.</p>
                            <p>This Government has already instituted a censorship both of mail and
                                telegrams. …</p>

                            <p>502. I saw President Arroyo at 6 this evening, who informed me that
                                he could make no official statement before consulting his Cabinet
                                but that speaking entirely personally “I am absolutely with
                                you”.</p>

                            <p>510. The President and Foreign Minister asked me to join them this
                                afternoon and indicated they were exploring future possibilities.
                                There are in Ecuador about 25 Japanese plus an active Chargé
                                d’Affaires. If Ecuador should declare war or even take some lesser
                                step that might involve the Japanese in a concentration camp it is
                                their feeling that Japan might endeavor to seize the Galapágos as a
                                base which Ecuador is unable to prevent. Thus with the intention of
                                helping us by interning the Japanese Ecuador might actually furnish
                                Japan a pretext to seize the Galapágos. Is there anything that I can
                                suggest in this connection?</p>

                                        Islands was one which would expose them to danger of
                                        Japanese attack or occupation, the Government of Ecuador
                                        would immediately be willing to discuss with the United

                            <p>I told the Ambassador that I hoped he would inform his Government
                                immediately, in the name of the President and of the Government of
                                the United States, of the deep appreciation with which this message
                                had been received. With regard to his final point, I said that I
                                would immediately consult the appropriate authorities of the United
                                States and would let him know what suggestions they might have to
                                offer.</p>

                            <p>380. Your 510, December 8, 8 p.m. Please inform the President and the
                                Foreign Minister that this Government has received assurances from
                                Peru that it will fulfill all its obligations and commitments under
                                the various inter-American agreements designed to implement
                                hemispheric solidarity. Peru has already taken a number of specific
                                steps to put this policy into practice and the Department has no
                                reason to believe that Peru is in any way subject to Axis
                                influence.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the proposed internment of a few Japanese nationals
                                in Ecuador, the Department does not believe that such measures would
                                affect in any way any plans the Japanese may have regarding the
                                Galápagos Islands, and considers such internment highly
                                important.</p>

                                The Ecuadorean Government asserts willingness to comply, is doing
                                what it can but asks for specific suggestions as to how we exercise
                                preventive power, regulations governing telecommunications were

                                and 479, of July 3 and 4, 1940. The Foreign Minister states that
                                Ecuador will be pleased to modify or amend regulations if we suggest
                                the changes.</p>

                            <p>528. The substance of Department’s telegram 380, December 10, 5 p.m.
                                seems to have satisfied the Foreign Minister with respect to Peru
                                and Axis influence.</p>
                            <p>However, he states that notwithstanding the fact that public opinion
                                is urging the Government to break off relations or declare war
                                against Japan Ecuador would first like to know what aid we are
                                prepared to give to patrol and defend the Galápagos Islands. He
                                would appreciate receiving as quickly as possible a statement of our
                                views regarding these islands.<note n="53" xml:id="d99fn1">See

                            <p>I explained that there might be some question as to the advisability
                                of any government establishing a base on the islands at this

                            <p>The Minister said he at least hoped that Japan would not regard them
                                as worth seizing. He asked whether we would rather arrange for their
                                use or run the risk of having Japan take possession of them?</p>

                            <p>107. At 1 p.m. today the National Legislative Assembly unanimously
                                declared El Salvador in a state of war with Japan and authorized the
                                Executive Power to take similar measures against any other
                                non-American powers which may commit acts of aggression against
                                American countries.</p>

                                    >Not printed.</note> regarding the Salvadoran Government’s
                                declaration of war on Japan, I have the honor to report that the
                                Salvadoran <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0103"/>public is
                                unquestionably whole heartedly in favor of its Government’s action
                                and that its sentiments are sincerely and warmly pro-United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>In the afternoon of December 8, a crowd of about two thousand persons
                                spontaneously gathered in front of the Legation and cheered the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>At five o’clock in the afternoon of December 9, a rally, organized by
                                the Pro Patria Party (the Government Party) was held in the Parque
                                Barrios in San Salvador. It has been variously estimated that there
                                were from 15,000 to 25,000 participants, many of whom wore the
                                Salvadoran colors, carried American and British flags, or “V”
                                labels. President Martínez, Cabinet Ministers, high Pro Patria Party
                                officials, and members of the Diplomatic Corps (including the staff
                                of this Legation), gathered on the balcony of the National Palace
                                which overlooks the Park. President Martinez, before a loud speaker
                                and microphone, addressed the mass meeting first. He declared that
                                El Salvador was at war, that the people must realize the real
                                meaning of the word “war”—hate and the destruction of culture. He
                                went on to say that El Salvador had declared war in defense of the
                                most precious of treasures, Liberty. “For the defense of America” he
                                said, “there will be no sacrifices, for the pleasure of doing what
                                honor and dignity demand, is not a sacrifice. What do you prefer to
                                be, slaves or free men?” To which the crowd shouted “free men!”</p>
                            <p>In my absence, First Lieutenant Moscoso, the Assistant Military
                                Attaché to the Legation, who has perfect command of Spanish, then
                                expressed the sincere appreciation of the United States for the
                                attitude of friendship of the Salvadoran Government and people. He
                                was followed by Dr. Lázaro Arévalo Vasconcellos, Attorney General of
                                the Republic, who, as President of the Pro Patria Party, expressed
                                his Party’s full support of the Government. After several other
                                short patriotic speeches, the demonstration was concluded with
                                cheering for El Salvador, the United States, and Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>Similar mass meetings, organized by the Pro Patria Party, were held
                                simultaneously in every other city and town of the Republic.</p>
                            <p>In the evening of December 11, several hundred students of the
                                University of El Salvador held a demonstration in front of the
                                Legation, at which I and the leaders of the students made short
                                speeches of friendship for the United States, followed by the usual
                                “vivas.”</p>
                            <p>Since the news of war with Japan became known, the Legation has
                                continued to receive a great number of telegrams from organizations
                                and private persons, expressing their abhorrence of Japan’s
                                treacherous aggression and their deep sympathy for the United
                                States.</p>

                                President Ubico. The President sent word to me by Chief of Protocol
                                to say that he personally had taken charge of the situation in
                                Guatemala and had himself communicated with all ports and other
                                strategic locations to insure against possibilities of sabotage.

                                was discussed fully with the Foreign Minister this morning and he
                                assured me that the Guatemalan Government censors all communications
                                excepting those transmitted by diplomatic pouch and that the
                                vigilance now being maintained over communications facilities
                                effectively prevents use detrimental to hemispheric security. He
                                promised to issue necessary instructions to appropriate authorities
                                calling attention to added importance of constant vigilance.</p>

                                apprehend any person showing any suspicious movement. While there
                                are no Japanese in this country he gave these orders in recognition
                                of the collaboration of Japan and Germany as Axis partners and the

                                    time as a Special Ambassador of Japan was in Washington carrying
                                    out diplomatic conversations with the high American authorities
                                    of the Department of State, the Japanese forces started
                                    bombarding Manila and the Hawaiian Islands attacking, in its
                                    possessions, the United States of America, and thus obligating
                                    themselves, before history, with all the responsibility of those
                                    events which are coming and which will, unfortunately, spread
                                    that conflagration which is afflicting humanity. The Government
                                    of Mexico, which, from the beginning of the present struggle,
                                    defined, with full energy, the spirit of positive solidarity
                                    which joins it to the other governments of the Continent, has
                                    learned with the deepest emotion of these deeds constituting a
                                    new violation of the fundamental principles of the rights of
                                    mankind committed by one of the powers grouped together with the
                                    totalitarian dictatorships against the democracies of the world.
                                    With that solemnity which is appropriate to the seriousness of
                                    the circumstances, Mexico declares that its conduct will
                                    inflexibly follow the postulates of justice and of honor which
                                    it has, until today, maintained without hesitation. In the

                                    accordance with the resolutions adopted in the Meeting of
                                    Foreign Ministers at Habana, in 1940, one of these postulates is
                                    the fact that any aggression against any nation of this
                                    hemisphere will be considered by our country as an aggression
                                    against our own sovereignty. Another of these postulates was
                                    definitely established in the note that our Chancery addressed,
                                    on July 8 of this year to the Uruguayan Chancery<note n="56"

                                    American Republic that, in defense of its rights finds itself in
                                    a state of war with countries of other continents. The foregoing
                                    principles are Solidly rooted in the public conscience of Mexico
                                    and are the direct consequence of the position that we have
                                    assumed in condemning all aggressions and in invariably raising
                                    our voice against any act implying the intention of placing the
                                    contingencies of war ahead of the solutions of justice. Our past
                                    is the best guarantee of our future. Associated with the United
                                    States in the common defense of democracy and of the destiny of
                                    America, we will omit no effort, by all possible means, to
                                    establish our spirit of solidarity and of close friendship. In
                                    this hour, of the greatest importance, the Government is
                                    convinced that the opinion which it expresses is that of all
                                    Mexicans and it has the absolute certainty that, irrespective of
                                    the results, the nation will carry out unanimously a decision
                                    which is in full accord with the continuity of its traditions
                                    and with the dignity of our future. Mexico, December 7,
                                    1941.”</p>

                                Your Excellency a copy of the statements which have just been made
                                in Mexico City by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ezequiel
                                Padilla. In this document, the Government of Mexico announces the
                                decision which it took today to break off diplomatic relations with
                                the Japanese Empire.</p>
                            <p>As the statements of Secretary Padilla are themselves sufficiently
                                explicit, it is unnecessary for me to expand upon the extraordinary
                                importance which the enclosed document has, not only for Mexico and
                                the United States, but also for the fate of Pan Americanism.</p>

                                        Affairs of Mexico, Made December</hi> 8, 1941</head>
                                <p>On repeated occasions the Government of Mexico has made public
                                    the purposes of unshakable solidarity which inspire the policy
                                    of our country’s relation with the other nations of this
                                    continent. In conformity with this attitude, Mexico—during the
                                    Meeting of Foreign Ministers held in Habana in 1940—agreed to
                                    consider as an act of aggression against itself any attack by a
                                    non-American State which <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0110"
                                    />should injure the fundamental rights of any of the Republics
                                    of this hemisphere.</p>
                                <p>The Government of Mexico, which has invariably advocated the
                                    absolute respect of international engagements voluntarily
                                    contracted, cannot fail to consider—as a natural consequence of
                                    the aforesaid declaration—that the maintenance of its diplomatic
                                    relations with Japan is incompatible with the act of aggression
                                    which the latter has committed against the United States of
                                    America.</p>
                                <p>Accordingly, instructions have been given to our Minister in
                                    Tokyo that, after notification of the foregoing to the
                                    authorities near which he is accredited, he shall proceed to
                                    close the Legation and the Consulate in Yokohama.</p>
                                <p>The above decision has been communicated to the Minister of Japan
                                    in this capital for similar effects, there having been
                                    cancelled, from this date, the provisional authorization granted
                                    to Consular Agents of the said Empire in the Mexican
                                    Republic.</p>

                                    xml:id="d117fn1">Not printed.</note> We learn from a thoroughly
                                reliable source that the Foreign Office is discussing the
                                possibility of recommending to the Mexican Congress the breaking of
                                diplomatic relations with Japan and declaring Mexico a
                                non-belligerent ally of the United States. The reason for this
                                attitude of the Foreign Office is understood to be that a
                                declaration of war by Mexico which has not the means to wage
                                effective warfare would subject this country to ridicule and that a
                                declaration of nonbelligerent alliance with the United States would
                                give the Mexican Government virtually the same power for national
                                defense that it would have under a formal declaration of war.
                                According to our informant all Japanese subjects will be interned
                                and the Japanese Minister will be handed his passports.</p>
                            <p>Definite action will probably be taken tomorrow December 9.</p>

                            <p>263. I saw the Minister of Foreign Affairs again this morning
                                regarding anti-sabotage measures, restriction of communications
                                facilities to totalitarians and Nicaragua’s declaration of war.</p>
                            <p>Guards have been placed at principal fuel and oil depots, radio and
                                telegraph stations and offices and both air ports in Managua. Guards
                                will be placed in the grounds of the German club which adjoins the
                                West India Oil Depot.</p>
                            <p>The President is taking steps to restrict the communications by
                                telephone and telegraph of Axis representatives and nationals. It is
                                understood that the German Legation telephone is now out of order. I
                                understand that orders have been given to confine the two Japanese
                                nationals in the country.</p>
                            <p>The President and Cabinet have been exploring ways and means of
                                arriving immediately at a state of war with Japan and yet doing so
                                in accordance with their constitutional procedure which requires 5
                                days of preliminary sessions before the Congress when reconvened can
                                transact war emergency business; or in this case, declare war. I
                                inquired of the Foreign Minister whether it would be within their
                                constitutional rights for the President to declare the existence of
                                a state of war as a fact “de hecho”, leaving it to Congress as soon
                                as possible to pass a formal declaration based on a formal message
                                to them. This might enable the President to declare a complete state
                                of emergency and “suspend guarantees” today.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister felt that this would be feasible and
                                subsequently I was called to the Casa Presidencial by the President
                                and asked to sit in on the Cabinet meeting as a guest. The President
                                and Cabinet then decided to issue a declaration in the foregoing
                                sense today.</p>
                            <p>The President also asked me, in the presence of his Cabinet, to
                                assure the United States that Nicaraguan territory is immediately
                                available for the use of American armed forces; that Nicaragua can
                                raise up to 10,000 men to cooperate in defense measures and that
                                these can be used if necessary, in this hemisphere at least, outside
                                of Nicaragua. He pointed out that the cost of maintaining a
                                Nicaraguan soldier would not be over half the cost for an American
                                soldier and instanced the possibility of their use at Panama.</p>
                            <p>He said that steps would be taken to make at least one of the two
                                Nicaraguan patrol vessels at Corinto seaworthy for local patrol. He
                                said that officers for these vessels would be needed and could only
                                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0113"/>be obtained from the
                                United States. (See my telegram no. 258 of December 7th.<note n="58"
                                    xml:id="d120fn1">Not printed.</note>) He said that if our
                                Government so desired, he would place Colonel Mullins in charge of
                                raising and training any Nicaraguan force so to be used.</p>
                            <p>He desired the unconditional support and solidarity of Nicaragua in
                                this war to be expressed to you and to President Roosevelt.</p>
                            <p>The Nicaraguan Congress will probably meet tonight or tomorrow and
                                some means will probably be found to hasten its formal action to
                                follow up the declaration the President will make today.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to recommend (1) an expression of thanks and
                                appreciation which can be published from President Roosevelt to
                                President Somoza (2) consideration and study with this Legation of
                                the feasibility of the acceptance of his offer for the use of a very
                                limited number of Nicaraguan troops to be incorporated into defense
                                service. If some American force, air or naval, for instance, could
                                be stationed in this country such troops might be assigned with
                                them. (3) Expedite measures for arming the patrol vessels GN–1 and
                                2. (4) Sending a Military Attaché who can act as liaison officer
                                with the War Department or [<hi rend="italic">on?</hi>] military
                                defense measures who can act from day to day.</p>
                            <p>Daily communication is being maintained between naval radio station
                                Panama and the Guardia station at the Presidency.</p>

                            <p>264. President Somoza has issued the following manifesto published in
                                today’s newspapers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The world already knows of the violent and unjustified
                                        aggression on the part of Japan of which the United States
                                        of America has been the object. Before this latest attack
                                        Nicaragua cannot remain indifferent, linked as it is with
                                        the nation of the north and with each of the sister
                                        republics of the western hemisphere not only by ties of
                                        geographic solidarity and of sincere democratic ideology but
                                        also by various declarations and pan American conventions
                                        signed in Lima, Panama and Habana which in themselves create
                                        an immediate obligation. In consequence my Government finds
                                        itself under the necessity of considering Nicaragua in a
                                        state of war ‘de hecho’ with Japan pending the legal
                                        declaration of such status by the National Congress in

                                        history is of transcendental importance to the destiny of

                            <p>266. Nicaraguan Congress this evening unanimously approved
                                declaration of war against Japan and authorized President Somoza to
                                declare war against any other non-American nation attacking or
                                declaring war against any American nation. This was followed by an
                                enthusiastic spontaneous demonstration by a large crowd in front of
                                the Legation. The diplomatic representatives of the American nations
                                and of Great Britain gathered at the Legation to witness the
                                demonstration and express thanks to the speakers.</p>

                            <p>483. The Government issued last night the following proclamation:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Government of the United States of America has
                                        officially informed the Government of Panama that the
                                        military forces of the Imperial Government of Japan today
                                        unexpectedly attacked the military bases of the United
                                        States situated in Hawaii and the Philippines this attack
                                        being in the form of an aerial bombardment which has caused
                                        an appreciable number of casualties and severe damage.
                                        Following this treacherous aggression carried out while a
                                        conference was being held in Washington in the midst of a
                                        spirit of peace between the Diplomatic Envoy of the Emperor
                                        of Japan and the Secretary of State of the United States the
                                        Government of Japan has declared that a state of war exists
                                        between that country and the United States of America. The
                                        Government at Washington at the same time has been forced to
                                        declare that there were immediately placed in operation all
                                        the war plans prepared by the United States to defend itself
                                        against the Government of Japan. The critical situation thus
                                        created places the Government of Panama in the face of a
                                        state of emergency the gravity of which is of indisputable
                                        proportions and in the face of such facts the Executive
                                        power after careful and detailed study of the situation and
                                        with the unanimous approval of the Cabinet Council has
                                        arrived at the conclusion that the present moment demands
                                        from the Panamanian Government a clear and defined
                                        declaration of Panama’s position in the face of this
                                        conflict and for that reason the Government proceeds to
                                        issue this proclamation which has as its purpose to declare
                                        that the Republic of Panama mindful of its principles of a
                                        purely democratic nation true to its international
                                        obligations has taken and will take all the measures which
                                        this emergency requires in order to cooperate in the defense
                                        and the protection of the Panama Canal the security of which
                                        as well as of the Republic itself are imminently threatened
                                        by the aggressor forces of the Government of Japan. The
                                        Panama Canal is the center of American defense and is a
                                        project in which the Panamanian nation as well as the United
                                        States have a joint and vital interest as was clearly
                                        established in the general treaty of March 2, 1936<note

                                        would endanger the security of the Republic of Panama or the
                                        neutrality or security of the Panama Canal the two
                                        Governments will take such measures of prevention and
                                        defense as they may consider necessary for the protection of
                                        their common interests. Mindful of this situation the
                                        Government has proceeded to intern Japanese subjects
                                        residing on the Isthmus as a precautionary measure, to
                                        forbid the exportation of gold or other funds belonging to

                                        order censorship of radio and cable communications and to
                                        intensify the surveillance of all elements who constitute or
                                        may constitute a threat against the common interests of
                                        Panama and the United States in the security of the Panama
                                        Canal. The Government of Panama takes this occasion to

                            <p>657. Department’s circular telegram dated December 7, 4 p.m. I
                                already had an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 5
                                p.m. Most of the Foreign Office officials were present. The Minister
                                was expecting my call and the Peruvian Government is taking action
                                to meet the new situation both from the point of view of Peruvian
                                interests and of hemispheric solidarity. The attitude of the Foreign
                                Minister was responsive and I believe that he will be prepared to
                                give favorable consideration to any suggestions from our Government.
                                I took occasion to point out that a solution of the boundary dispute
                                with Ecuador would contribute to hemispheric solidarity.</p>
                            <p>The Peruvian Ministries of Government, War and Marine have issued
                                instructions to put into effect the comprehensive plans against <pb

                                activities which had been prepared. The movements of Japanese in
                                Peru will be controlled.</p>
                            <p>All American interests have been advised and are taking precautionary
                                measures. Panagra will refuse to carry any German, Italian or
                                Japanese passengers until further notice. The British Minister
                                informs me that necessary steps have been taken to protect the
                                central railway.</p>
                            <p>Peru realizes its special problem because of the large Japanese
                                colony and in the event that it remains neutral the Foreign Minister
                                informed me that neutrality measures would not apply to the United
                                States. He said that he could see no need for continued Japanese
                                consular representation in Peru. The breaking off of diplomatic
                                relations with Japan probably depend somewhat upon the action taken
                                by other American Governments. The Foreign Minister said that Peru
                                will immediately reexamine all military questions on the basis of
                                the staff conversations which have taken place between our two
                                countries. The President and Cabinet are meeting this evening and
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs will see me again tomorrow. In the
                                meantime he gave me the encouraging message contained in my telegram
                                No. 656, December 7, 7 p.m.</p>

                                reform and his determination to carry it out in accordance with
                                national will in spite of Herrerista opposition. He reaffirms
                                forcefully Uruguay’s international stand and his determination to
                                proceed with defense measures for country’s own protection and
                                continental defense in compliance with international obligations. He

                                of airports which would be available to air forces of America. <pb

                                elections he stressed need for a successor committed to same
                                policies. In a passage interpolated at last minute he referred to
                                Japanese attack on United States stating that it constituted a new
                                and grave preoccupation for Uruguay, that foreseeing such a
                                development the Government had studied the resulting situation
                                consulting neighboring countries and seeking a continental solution,
                                and that the path to follow was indicated by the Panama and Habana
                                Conferences. Various references to United States were

                                views of the Uruguayan Government somewhat later. For the time being
                                he asked me to advise the Department that Uruguay considers itself
                                already solidly with the United States and is consulting other
                                governments with a view to making this solidarity effective
                                throughout the continent. He mentioned in particular consultation
                                with Brazil and Argentina.</p>

                            <p>523. At 1 a.m. this morning Guani handed me the text of the following
                                decree dated December 8th: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In view of the communications received from the Embassy of
                                        the United States of America advising of the state of war
                                        existing between its country and the Japanese Empire from
                                        which it is evident that this state of war was commenced by
                                        the Japanese forces without prior declaration or
                                        notification of any kind contrary to the accepted <pb

                                        international law the precepts of which form the basis of
                                        the American community; considering that in view of the
                                        methods adopted by Japan this new state of war may be
                                        considered a veritable unprovoked aggression against an
                                        American country and that in accordance with the principles
                                        of continental solidarity this action perturbs the peace of
                                        the hemisphere and affects all the members of our community
                                        whereas, especially in the declaration of Lima signed
                                        December 24, 1938 there was proclaimed the common interest
                                        and the determination to make effective the solidarity of
                                        the American Republics in such cases and subsequently
                                        Resolution XV of the consultative meeting held at Habana in
                                        1940 declared that any attack by a non-American state on the
                                        integrity, the territorial inviolability, the sovereignty or
                                        political independence of an American state, will be
                                        considered as an act of aggression against all the signatory
                                        states; considering furthermore that as respects the
                                        Government of the Republic the memorandum of the Uruguayan
                                        Foreign Office of June 21, last, suggested to all the
                                        nations of America that they expedite the means of giving a
                                        positive and concrete reality to these declarations of
                                        principles in concordance with the decree of June 18th, 1917
                                        to the effect that no American country, finding itself in a
                                        state of war with nations of other continents in defense of
                                        its rights may be treated as a belligerent; the President of
                                        the Republic resolves and decrees: <list>

                            <p>537. Department’s circular of December 8, 1 a.m. Contents of circular
                                were brought immediately [to?] Guani’s [attention?] and were
                                discussed with him again today. He tells me that the Government is
                                doing and will do everything possible to prevent hostile use of
                                communications. At the same time I have been urging in strongest
                                terms both Guani and the President to take increased precautionary
                                measure at fuel depots, public utilities, et cetera, against
                                sabotage. Psychology and public opinion in general are with us 100
                                percent. However, I cannot have unlimited confidence in the efficacy
                                of their defense against possible Nazi sabotage or other hostile
                                activities and I share the regret of the President and Guani
                                expressed to me today that no American naval vessel is readily
                                available.</p>

                                        that Venezuela, in accordance with inter-American agreements
                                        and animated by the spirit of continental solidarity which
                                        has historically guided its foreign policy, will discharge
                                        fully the obligations assumed with the United States of
                                        America and with all other nations of the continent.</p>
                                    <p>The National Government is certain that the Venezuelan people

                            <p>At this moment I have just finished speaking to my fellow citizens,
                                reaffirming the solidarity of the Government and the people of
                                Venezuela with the United States and the other American countries,
                                and declaring that in their defense there cooperate all the moral,
                                intellectual and material forces of the nation whose destinies I
                                have the honor to direct. Such is, in the grave emergency which
                                faces the continent, the attitude of Venezuela, which thus satisfies
                                its own sentiments and follows the undertakings of inter-American

                                clearly demonstrates that the fate of every free and peace-loving

                                the request for consultation but, on the basis of the answer
                                received, determine the date of the meeting, prepare the agenda, and
                                adopt all other measures advisable for the preparation of the
                                meeting, it is hoped that each country will appropriately instruct

                            exactly what he had on his mind. I gathered that he felt somewhat
                            embarrassed by the message from Dr. Rossetti invoking a consultative
                            meeting. …</p>
                        <p>In any case, I informed the Ambassador that the Minister’s message was
                            welcome, that it was my understanding that Dr. Rossetti’s message as
                            well as that of Mr. Hull would be circulated this afternoon by Dr. Rowe
                            to the Chiefs of Mission in Washington from the other American Republics
                            so that the Chiefs of Mission could transmit to their Governments both
                            messages at the same time. The Ambassador went away apparently satisfied
                            that Chile’s initiative had not produced any embarrassment.</p>

                            1942 in Rio de Janeiro. Pursuant to the procedure stipulated in
                            Resolution XVII this request has been accompanied by a list of the
                            questions with which this Government deems the consultative meeting

                        <p>680. Reference Department’s circular telegram dated December 10, 6 p.m. I
                            informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning about the
                            declaration of war by Germany and Italy although I told him that as yet
                            I had no instructions from my Government.</p>
                        <p>I notified the Minister of the agenda for the consultative meeting and he
                            showed me a cable from Concha<note n="12" xml:id="d159fn1">Carlos
                                Concha, special representative of Peru at Washington to deal with
                                the boundary dispute between Ecuador and Peru.</note> saying that
                            there is nothing in the agenda that would indicate that the boundary
                            question would be discussed. He suggested that the three mediatory
                            Governments indicate to Ecuador that this is not the time to complicate
                            the international situation by raising the boundary question at the
                            conference. I replied that it would be much better if the two parties
                            would reach an agreement in principle immediately so that the three
                            mediatory Governments could announce that it would not be necessary to
                            consider the matter at the Rio de Janeiro meeting. The Minister told me
                            that Viteri<note n="13" xml:id="d159fn2">Homero Viteri La Fronte,
                                special representative of Ecuador at Washington to deal with the
                                boundary dispute between Ecuador and Peru.</note> has announced his
                            return to Quito because of the fact that the consultative meeting will
                            solve all of Ecuador’s problems. The Minister said he had heard nothing
                            about a Bolivian move to organize a united front of South American
                            countries prior to the consultative meeting. My own opinion is that
                            Bolivia is acting in this sense and that the Peruvian Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs knows something about it.</p>
                        <p>The Minister told me that he plans to attend the conference, that he will
                            go by way of Santiago, Buenos Aires and Montevideo and that he will not
                            travel by air.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the action of Colombia the Minister and I agreed that one
                            evident result of the consultative meeting would be the breaking off of
                            diplomatic relations with Japan and the other partners of the Axis by
                            all of the American Republics. The Minister said that Peru would sever
                            diplomatic relations with Japan immediately if it knew what to do with
                            the large Japanese population. In reply to the Minister’s question about
                            what we were doing with <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0135"
                            />Japanese citizens I replied that they were being placed in
                            concentration camps when such action is necessary. The Minister thought
                            it would be impossible to intern Japanese in Peru because of the large
                            numbers and of the expense involved. He asked if we had any suggestions
                            to make and repeated that Peru is disposed to sever diplomatic relations
                            with Japan.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the Department might authorize me to inform the
                            Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the United States would welcome a
                            severance of diplomatic relations with Japan by Peru and that our
                            Government would be willing to lend financial assistance in connection
                            with the necessary internment of Japanese citizens in Peru.</p>

                        <p>Since this morning, Costa Rica has offered the suggestion that the

                            offered by Guatemala and Venezuela. (Instructions are being sent to our
                            representatives in these three countries informing them that, according
                            to Resolution XVII of Habana, this next meeting must be held in Rio de

                            considers that his attendance at the proposed meeting while Ecuadoran
                            soil is still occupied by Peruvian troops would be humiliating. Peru—The
                            Foreign Minister is worried that the Ecuadoran boundary question may be
                            raised at the meeting. Honduras, while agreeing to the meeting, does not
                            believe it necessary at this time.</p>

                        <p>399. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="17" xml:id="d161fn1"
                                >Alberto Echandi.</note> informed me this morning that last
                            September the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d161fn2">Carlos Salazar.</note> had made a suggestion to
                            other Central American States including Costa Rica that an exchange of
                            views regarding a common foreign policy would be advisable. Until the
                            present critical international situation developed, Costa Rica did not
                            reply, the Government being of the opinion that the Guatemalan
                            “insinuation” was made chiefly for internal political reasons. Echandi
                            said that he has now replied in the affirmative suggesting furthermore
                            that a meeting of Central American representatives should take place in
                            Guatemala within the next 10 days. Guatemala has agreed. He said that
                            the Government intends to name as its representative Luis Anderson.</p>
                        <p>The Costa Rican Government has also proposed that Panama also be invited
                            in order that Panama may be identified with the Central American point
                            of view rather than that of the “Bolivian” States.<note n="19"

                        <p>Echandi said that the real purpose of the meeting would be to insure a
                            common foreign policy in sympathy with that of United States prior to
                            the meeting at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Ecuador called to see me this morning and left with me
                            the attached telegram.<note n="20" xml:id="d163fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            I told the Ambassador that I felt it would be disastrous if the
                            Government of Ecuador were not represented at the Consultative Meeting
                            in Rio de Janeiro and that the Governments of Argentina, Brazil and the
                            United States were making every possible effort to find some way in
                            which the boundary controversy could be canalized towards a pacific
                            solution before the date of the Rio meeting. I said, however, that, if
                            this should prove impossible in view of the world situation and the
                            desperate crisis which confronts the Western Hemisphere, it seemed to me
                            inconceivable that Ecuador should not be represented at the meeting.</p>

                            the past before the holding of any inter-American conference.</p>
                        <p>I should in particular like to know what his views may be as to the
                            attitude which Chile and Argentina may take with regard to the severance
                            of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers as a part of a continental
                            security policy. [Welles.]</p>

                                n="22" xml:id="d165fn1">Not printed.</note> This Government
                            considers it highly desirable that the meeting be held in Rio de
                            Janeiro, both because of the fact that the psychology created by the
                            holding of the meeting in that capital would be altogether favorable as
                            well as because of the fact that in that event the presidency of the
                            conference would be vested in the hands of Aranha.</p>
                        <p>Please express these views to Aranha and inform him that several of the
                            Governments of the Central American Republics have expressed the desire
                            that the conference be held either in Washington or in Panama. To all of
                            these suggestions I have replied that in as much as the Consultative
                            Meeting of Habana unanimously and officially determined that the next
                            Consultative Meeting would be held in Rio de Janeiro, this Government
                            considers it undesirable to raise the question of changing the agreement
                            there reached.</p>
                        <p>I consider it expedient from every point of view that the meeting be held
                            at Rio de Janeiro. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>1381. From the Under Secretary. Please tell Aranha that I have informed
                            the Chilean Ambassador here of our strong opinion that the consultative
                            meeting should be held in Rio, as was agreed in Habana in July 1940. The
                            Ambassador, who will transmit this view <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129"
                                facs="0139"/>to Santiago, has expressed the belief that his
                            Government will now desist from any efforts to change the location of
                            the meeting. [Welles.]</p>

                                López de Mesa.</note> told me that speaking purely personally, since
                            he had no right to speak officially, the Peruvian Ambassador had been
                            continuously making representations that his country’s differences with
                            Ecuador should under no circumstances even be referred to in the
                            forthcoming consultative conference. On the other hand Ecuador had been
                            insisting although unofficially that there should be discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Minister felt it was best for this matter not to arise in the
                            conference but that recognition of its existence should be taken outside
                            of the conference as for instance by a statement to be made by the
                            mediating nations giving assurances that the affair was well in
                            hand.</p>

                            <p>The Canadian Chargé d’Affaires called to see me this morning.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wrong stated that he had been talking this morning on the
                                telephone to the Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, in connection with
                                the statement I had made to Mr. Wrong yesterday on behalf of the
                                President with regard to the suggestion that Canada might
                                participate in the consultative meeting of the Foreign Ministers of
                                the American Republics to be held in Rio de Janeiro on January 15
                                next.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mackenzie King desired that the President be informed that he
                                fully appreciated the validity of the reasons advanced by the
                                President for believing that it was impossible, under existing
                                inter-American agreements, for Canada to take part in that meeting;
                                that he greatly appreciated the frankness and the friendly nature of
                                the President’s message; and that he felt sure that the President
                                would understand that, in following up the initiative taken by the
                                Dominican Government, the Canadian Government believed it was
                                adopting a policy which would be helpful to the United States in its
                                relations with the other American Republics.</p>
                            <p>I said to Mr. Wrong that I should be very glad to transmit this
                                message to the President. I added that I felt sure it was
                                unnecessary for me to say anything further with regard to the
                                President’s desire to cooperate in every way possible with Canada
                                since the President <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0141"/>had
                                made this policy so clear on repeated occasions during the past nine
                                years. I said that in accordance with the President’s wishes I would
                                consult the representatives of the other American Republics, who
                                would meet in Rio de Janeiro, in an unofficial way in order to find
                                out what their feeling might be with regard to the participation by
                                Canada in the regular Pan American conference which would take place
                                in 1943.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wrong then said that he felt it was desirable for this Government
                                to know that, in the event the other American Republics desired
                                Canada to participate in any inter-American conference as a member
                                of the Pan American Union, the Government of Canada would be glad to
                                do so.</p>
                            <p>I replied that I should be very glad to communicate this information
                                to the President.</p>

                        <p>518. Please express to the Foreign Minister the Department’s sincere
                            appreciation for the information he has furnished you regarding the
                            attitude of the Peruvian and Ecuadoran representatives in Bogotá with
                            regard to the boundary dispute and the forthcoming consultative meeting.
                            Recent developments make it possible that some agreement at least in
                            principle between the two countries may solve this problem prior to
                            January 15, the date of the Rio meeting. If, however, no agreement is
                            reached, the Department will bear very much in mind the helpful
                            suggestions of Dr. López de Mesa.</p>

                            support to a resolution to be proposed at Rio de Janeiro to the effect
                            that those American Governments which have not yet declared war should
                            do so cojointly.</p>

                        <p>Personal. I am most anxious that the Governments of the American
                            republics be fully informed regarding developments in the foreign policy
                            of the United States, particularly as it affects the European situation.
                            The different steps in that policy are, of course, designed to further
                            those standards of international conduct which have been approved by the
                            American republics at their gatherings in recent years.</p>
                        <p>Please, therefore, take an early opportunity of calling upon the Foreign
                            Minister of the country to which you are accredited for the purpose of
                            describing to him on my behalf the objectives and the details of the
                            “Bill to Aid the Defense of the Democracies” as set forth in Radio
                            Bulletin No. 8 of January 10, 1941. You should, at the same time,
                            emphasize to the Foreign Minister the appraisal of the international
                            situation contained in my statement of January 15 before the House
                            Foreign Affairs Committee<note n="1" xml:id="d174fn1">Department of

                                reactions of the 20 other American Republics. There was no
                                unfavorable note among the replies. The Costa Rican Foreign Minister
                                cited a Spanish proverb as follows: “When there is a fire in the
                                neighborhood, it is not at all helpful to pour water on your own
                                home, but it is better to run to the fire and throw water on your
                                neighbor’s house.” (740.0011 European War, 1939/7745) The Ecuadoran
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that from the Latin American
                                viewpoint, the Lend-Lease Bill might be improved by adding to the
                                title or in the text, the words “hemisphere or continental defense”
                                to the phrase “for the <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0144"
                                />defense of the United States”. Boaz Long, the American Minister,
                                explained that “for the defense of the United States and other
                                purposes” was probably intended to cover the Minister’s suggestion.

                            by the other American Republics in the United States has been clarified
                            in certain particulars to the extent that it is believed the following
                            steps should be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. A letter should be sent to the President informing him that the State,
                            War and Navy Departments have agreed that it is essential to the defense
                            not only of the other American countries but also of the United States
                            to furnish those countries during the next few years with military and
                            naval matériel to the value of approximately $400,000,000 and that
                            economic and financial stringency will make it impossible for the other
                            American Republics to pay, whether in raw materials, or cash, or through
                            loans, for all of this matériel. The President, therefore, should be
                            informed that it would obviously be unwise to initiate discussions with
                            the other American Republics for the furnishing of this matériel unless
                            the President were prepared to consider as vital to the defense of the
                            United States, the defense of those countries, thereby enabling them to
                            obtain all of the matériel considered essential to their defense by the
                            Secretaries of War and of the Navy.</p>
                        <p>I have prepared a draft of such a letter<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn3"
                                >Dated April 22, 1941; not printed.</note> which has the approval of
                            Mr. Hackworth.<note n="5" xml:id="d175fn4">Green H. Hackworth, Legal
                                Adviser.</note> With your approval, the draft of this letter will be
                            discussed informally with the proper officers of the War and Navy
                            Departments for their suggestion prior to submitting it to Mr. Stimson
                            and Mr. Knox<note n="6" xml:id="d175fn5">Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of
                                War, and Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy.</note> for
                            signature.</p>
                        <p>2. If the President’s reply is affirmative the next step. would seem to
                            be for each Chief of Mission of the American countries, in Washington,
                            to be informed of the maximum amount of munitions and naval supplies
                            that this Government can undertake to furnish during the next few years.
                            It is suggested that this opportunity be taken to impress upon these
                            diplomatic representatives that, at this juncture, the best defense of
                            the western hemisphere is through the continued <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0145"/>resistance of Great Britain; that this
                            country is sending every piece of matériel that it can spare from its
                            own Army and Navy to Great Britain<note n="7" xml:id="d175fn6">For

                            more of the supplies requested by the several American countries.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic representatives should be furnished a price list of the
                            principal items which this Government is prepared to furnish with the
                            request that they secure from their Governments a list of the items
                            which their Governments desire within the total amount to be made
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Although at first, I thought that it would be preferable for
                            representatives of the War and Navy Departments to inform the several
                            countries of the amount allocated to each, it seems to me now that it
                            would be better if the Department undertook this task. It is believed
                            that by painting the entire picture to the diplomatic representatives it
                            will be easier to secure acquiescence in the figure allocated to each
                            country than were this job to be handled by military and naval
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>3. The preparation of the list of items which each Government desires
                            within the total amount set aside for each will probably result in many
                            questions which can only properly be answered if each Government has
                            some qualified military or naval officer in Washington to handle the
                            discussion with representatives of the War and Navy Departments.</p>
                        <p>4. Once the tentative list of requests has been agreed upon by the
                            representatives of the other American Governments in Washington and the
                            representatives of the War and Navy Departments, this list should be
                            submitted officially by the Government concerned through the usual
                            diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>5. This list should be communicated by the State Department to the War
                            and Navy Departments. There would be no need, as I see it, for the list
                            to pass through Mr. Curtis’ office. With this, I think Mr. Curtis is in
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The question of payment will probably arise immediately. Although I have
                            not yet definite recommendations regarding the procedure to be followed
                            with regard to negotiating the mode of payment with each country, it
                            seems to me that when the question is raised each country should be
                            informed that this question will be negotiated as and when the definite
                            list of matériel desired is agreed upon with our War and Navy
                            Departments. In the meantime, study should be made to determine in the
                            case of each country what payment can be made in raw materials, what
                            payment can be made in cash, what payment can be made through credits
                            advanced by the Export-Import Bank and what part will have to be covered
                            under the Lend Lease Bill.</p>
                        <p>Although the determination of the mode of payment is important, it is not
                            as immediately urgent as the determination of the items <pb n="136"
                                xml:id="pg_136" facs="0146"/>which each country desires and the
                            placing of those orders. This, in turn, might be preceded by some
                            indication of the President’s views regarding the application of the
                            Lend Lease Bill. If the President does not wish to use the Lend Lease
                            Bill, it would appear necessary drastically to revise the proposed
                            allocation.</p>

                        <p>I had interviews separately this morning and this afternoon with the
                            Ambassadors of Argentina, Peru, Cuba and Colombia and with the Ministers
                            of Bolivia and Uruguay. I communicated to them the allocation made for
                            their respective governments from the amount determined by the War and
                            Navy Departments and approved by the President to come under the terms
                            of the Lend-Lease Bill as assistance to be granted by the Government of
                            the United States to the other American Republics in building up their
                            own defense resources. I explained to them that I was conveying this
                            information to them in the greatest confidence and that I trusted that
                            their respective governments would, in the shortest time possible,
                            designate responsible military and naval officers to discuss the
                            formulation of final arrangements with the appropriate authorities in
                            the War and Navy Departments here.</p>
                        <p>I indicated to them the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act insofar as
                            compensation was involved and I stressed the point that the proposed
                            arrangements did not imply that all of the material desired by the
                            respective countries was immediately available but that it would be
                            forthcoming in accordance with the terms of the specific agreements to
                            be entered into and always provided that our own requirements and the
                            requirements of the nations actually resisting aggression made it
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>All of the diplomatic representatives expressed their great appreciation
                            and informed me that they would consult promptly with their governments

                            conversations which have taken place between the military and naval
                            officials of the United States and the other American republics,
                            excepting Panama, during which the latter expressed the need of their
                            countries for military equipment. These requests were carefully studied
                            by the Joint Advisory Board, a committee composed of officers of the
                            Army and Navy, and the Secretaries of War and the Navy concluded that it
                            is essential to the defense of the United States that military and naval
                            matériel to the value of approximately $400,000,000 should be furnished
                            to those republics during the next few years. Of this amount about
                            $80,000,000 would be supplied up to July 1, 1942, provided its use is
                            not deemed by this Government to be more important elsewhere. This
                            Department concurred in these recommendations. These materials would be
                            procured through the War and Navy Departments in the same way that they
                            effect their own procurement, the funds covering such procurement to
                            come out of appropriations now available under Public Law 23, 77th
                                Congress.<note n="10" xml:id="d177fn3">55 Stat. 53.</note></p>
                        <p>It is probable that a part of the needed material can be purchased
                            through cash payments by the American republics. A part would be paid by
                            furnishing strategic raw materials. Some countries have indicated that
                            they would like to obtain credits. Others, however, will be unable to
                            afford the cost of the material which it is believed by their military
                            authorities and ours they should obtain unless a part of these supplies
                            are furnished them under the provisions of the Lease-Lend Act (Public
                            Law 11).<note n="11" xml:id="d177fn4">55 Stat. 31.</note></p>
                        <p>The letter recommends that the Secretary of State be authorized to inform
                            the governments of the American republics that the President considers
                            their defense vital to the defense of the United States under the terms
                            of Public Law 11 and that the Secretary of State may initiate
                            negotiations with each of the American republics to prepare <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0148"/>a program of munitions totaling
                            $400,000,000 to be supplied to these countries by the United States, in
                            accordance with the plan elaborated by the Joint Advisory Board.</p>
                        <p>The President has expressed his approval of the views and recommendations
                            expressed in this letter.</p>
                        <p>The Department has invited the attention of the chiefs of the missions
                            representing the American republics to the information outlined above
                            and has requested them to ask their governments to designate
                            representatives with whom the officers of the War and Navy Departments
                            could discuss their countries’ requirements in accordance with the plan
                            formulated by the Joint Advisory Board. The Department will conduct the
                            negotiations concerning the method of payment for the material, the
                            value of which, according to the aforementioned plan, would be
                            $21,000,000 for naval material only, in the case of Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing has been furnished to you for your confidential information
                            in the event that it should be desirable for you to discuss any aspects

                            other American republics with a total of $400,000,000 of military and
                            naval matériel. At that time you indicated your approval of this general
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The Department has now worked out in consultation with the Division of
                            Defense Aid Reports a draft text of basic agreement which would be
                            entered into by this Government with each of the other American
                            republics. The draft, which is enclosed, is worked out with special
                            reference to Brazil, and it is suggested that the only changes to be
                            incorporated in the drafts relating to the other American republics
                            would be in respect of the financial details appropriate to each
                            country. There is attached a table<note n="13" xml:id="d178fn3">Not

                            total amounts to be paid into the United States Treasury over a period
                            of six years.</p>

                        <p>This program is based on deliveries of matériel over a period of at least
                            three years and payments by the other American republics into the
                            Treasury over a period of six years. In the event that the emergency is
                            terminated before the expiration of these periods of delivery or
                            payment, it would probably be necessary and desirable to reconsider the
                            program and perhaps to modify the basic agreements in accordance with
                            the new circumstances.</p>
                        <p>If you approve the draft basic agreement and suggested schedule of
                            payments, the Department is prepared to begin immediate negotiations
                            with the representatives of Brazil, Colombia and eventually all of the

                        <p>Negotiations of basic lend-lease agreements have been taken up by the
                            Department with the following countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
                            Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti,
                            Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, El Salvador, Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>We have not approached Argentina since the Argentine military list and
                            total amount have not yet been determined. There has been no approach to
                            Panama because it seems doubtful whether any armaments and munitions
                            will be made available to Panama. We have not approached Ecuador and
                            Peru, pending further instructions from the Under Secretary. With
                            respect to Mexico, no amounts have been fixed by the War and Navy
                            Departments, but it is understood that the Under Secretary has taken the
                            matter up in the Liaison Committee <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143"
                                facs="0153"/>and that such amounts will be rapidly set. When this

                            <item>The scope of the Act of March 11, 1941, with respect to such
                                projects has already been partly delimited by counsel. It has been
                                definitively ruled that no funds may be expended under lend-lease
                                for local labor or other costs. The Lend-Lease Act applies only to
                                the procuring of actual “defense articles” or “defense information”
                                within the United States and its delivery, if desired, to any point
                                either within the United States or even as far as the foreign
                                country. The Lend-Lease Act includes the provision of services
                                within the United States such as the repair of a vessel in a navy
                                yard.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As defined in the Act “defense article” means military or naval
                                matériel or “any agricultural, industrial or other commodity or
                                article for defense”. Foodstuffs are being transferred to England
                                “for defense” as the maintenance of the population is obviously
                                necessary for the defense of Britain. A railroad is being
                                constructed from Burma to China “for defense” as this railway will
                                serve as the means for getting defense matériel to China. Although
                                in the most general and indirect sense it could be said that any
                                project which will contribute to the maintenance or development of
                                the economies of the nations of the Western Hemisphere will
                                contribute to the defense of the hemisphere, it would obviously be a
                                thin extension of the basic purposes of the Act to try to cover
                                within its scope such matters as general highways and railway
                                development in the other American republics.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In addition to the legal limitations of the Act, which do as has
                                been mentioned above include general agricultural, industrial or
                                other articles so long as they are for defense purposes, we must
                                look into the intention of Congress and of the Administration as
                                developed in hearing <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0155"/>and
                                debates. The original hearings and debate of the Lend-Lease Act and
                                the original appropriations included no mention whatsoever of the
                                other American republics. Indeed in the hearings on the current
                                appropriation bill, the Defense Aid witnesses made much of the fact
                                that no funds had actually been devoted up to now to the other
                                American republics. At the same time a part of the appropriation is
                                now being requested for the other American republics with direct
                                reference to the specific proposal of the War and Navy Departments
                                for a $400,000,000 program of transferring naval and military
                                matériel. The history of this $400,000,000 program leaves no doubt
                                that it was intended to include only actual military equipment and
                                no material which would be necessary for a general economic
                                development program. It thus would presumably be necessary to go to
                                Congress to receive authorization for including under the Lend-Lease
                                Act any such general economic program.</item>

                            <item>Moreover, the authorization of the President for the Department to
                                negotiate with the other American republics was with specific
                                reference to the direct military program.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>In addition to this legal background which makes it extremely
                                unlikely that it would be proper to attempt to stretch the
                                lend-lease program to cover general economic development works,
                                there remains the broad and basic question of whether it is
                                desirable to mix at this time this type of procedure with the
                                general program moving forward with the Export-Import Bank.
                                Obviously if lend-lease terms of only partial repayment are to be
                                extended to general development works, no nations will wish to
                                continue with Export-Import Bank credits. The possible difficulties
                                of this extension are obvious.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This position is taken in spite of the fact that as an economist rather
                            than as a political strategist or military technician I would personally
                            be much happier to see the other American republics incur financial
                            obligations in connection with projects of economic development. I
                            believe, however, that until such time as the Department finds it
                            desirable to obtain specific appropriations of Congress for particular
                            development projects of a special mutual interest to the United States
                            and the other American republics, such as the present bill which would
                            grant $20,000,000 towards the completion of the Inter-American Highway
                            in Central America, we should go forward with development projects
                            financed through the Export-Import Bank and, as soon as we are able to
                            establish it, the Inter-American Bank.</p>

                                <item>Pending agreements—It is suggested in general that no pressure
                                    be placed by the Department on other governments to sign
                                    agreements, and that as governments approach the Department to
                                    conclude negotiations already well in progress, it be indicated
                                    that the first year deliveries cannot at the moment be
                                    accurately forecast. It is suggested that new agreements omit
                                    the sentence in Article I which relates to the amount of
                                    deliveries which it is contemplated will be made in the first
                                    year. It is also suggested that we adopt for all future
                                    agreements the new Article II proposed for Venezuela and
                                    Argentina. This Article II, which is much less cumbersome than
                                    the former, provides for a simple proportional payment for such
                                    goods as are delivered. There is attached a copy of the proposed
                                    new form.<note n="27" xml:id="d183fn5">Not

                        <p>If you approve this new procedure, we can go ahead on this new basis with
                            El Salvador which is about ready to sign a lend-lease agreement.</p>

                            signed under the authority you gave on June 28, 1941 Lend-Lease
                            Agreements with seven of the other American republics. Signature of
                            several other Lend-Lease Agreements is imminent.</p>
                        <p>Under the Lend-Lease program for the other American republics recommended
                            to you on April 22, 1941 by the Secretaries of State, War and Navy<note

                            and approved by you, the United States offered to deliver $400,000,000
                            of war matériel to those republics over several years. It was
                            contemplated that $101,000,000 worth should be delivered in the first
                            year of the Agreements.</p>
                        <p>While the acquisition by the other American countries of war matériel in
                            the United States had already suffered setbacks and delays owing to the
                            precedence necessarily accorded to urgent programs for supplying the
                            nations actively resisting aggression, the difficulties of supply, now
                            that the United States is a belligerent, are of course greatly
                            increased. In fact, this Department has just received from the War Plans
                            Division of the General Staff a letter reading in part as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The great demands for military equipment resulting from Japan’s
                                    attacks have made it practically impossible to find anything for
                                    immediate or even reasonably prompt delivery to Latin American
                                    Republics.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Although fully recognizing that the needs of our armed forces are
                            paramount under present circumstances, I nevertheless believe that a
                            failure by the United States to agree to furnish limited quantities of
                            military matériel to the other American republics, particularly those
                            which are most vulnerable to attack, would have an exceedingly
                            unfortunate effect and would be seized upon by our enemies to create an
                            atmosphere of doubt and fear which would hardly be conducive to the
                            success of the meeting of Foreign Ministers at Rio de Janeiro in January
                            or to the continuing cooperation of the other American republics with
                            this Government in our war effort. I need not emphasize the
                            undesirability from our point of view of any unfavorable modification in
                            the highly satisfactory position adopted by those Republics following
                            the crisis with which the treacherous Japanese attack has confronted the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p>I believe that in reaching a decision in this matter you will wish to
                            take into consideration the international political implications of the
                            problem as I have endeavored to state them. While I realize that these
                            must be balanced against the requirements of the military situation, I
                            feel strongly that the amounts of matériel necessary, even though
                            reduced from the original schedules, to maintain the confidence of the
                            American countries in the United States ability to deliver are very
                            modest compared with our total war output.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that your decision would be extremely helpful to the
                            committee I understand you have formed of General Marshall, Admiral
                            Stark and Mr. Hopkins for passing on war matériel allocations and
                            diversions.</p>

                            materials the export of which from the United States has been restricted
                            in the interest of the national defense under the authority of the Act
                            of July 2, 1940.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">54 Stat. 712.</note> As
                            will be observed, these are for the most part commodities which either
                            are not produced in the United States or are not produced here in
                            sufficient quantities to meet the rapidly expanding needs of our defense
                            program. The export of some of these commodities is very rigidly
                            restricted, the export of others is permitted to proceed with
                            comparative freedom, the action taken in each instance depending upon
                            the extent of the supplies or the gravity of the shortage existing in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Every effort has been and is being made not to interfere with purchases
                            in this country of these articles and materials by the other American
                            Republics, and licenses are issued for export to those republics in all
                            cases unless United States stocks of the commodity in question are
                            dangerously small or are absolutely essential to our own defense
                            program. Licenses have in general been granted for the export to the
                            other American Republics of their normal pre-war purchases even of those
                            commodities in which we have a serious deficiency. We have attempted
                            also, in so far as we were able, to make available to the other American
                            Republics indispensable articles and materials which they have not in
                            the past customarily obtained in the United States but the other sources
                            of supply of which are now cut off.</p>
                        <p>It is this Government’s intention to continue during 1941 to sanction the
                            export to the other American Republics of quantities of the <pb n="150"
                                xml:id="pg_150" facs="0160"/>commodities in question representing as
                            large a proportion of their usual imports of these commodities from all
                            sources as the extent of our stocks and the needs of our defense permit.
                            It is also our desire to consider sympathetically requests that may be
                            received from the Governments of the other American Republics for
                            permission to obtain in the United States quantities of these
                            commodities in excess of their usual imports, if such quantities should
                            prove to be absolutely essential in view of existing world conditions.
                            In order that these objectives may be achieved and that they may be
                            coordinated with our procurement plans, it is necessary that this
                            Government have as accurate a forecast as possible of the probable
                            requirements of these republics during 1941.</p>
                        <p>You are requested, therefore, to transmit promptly to the Department
                            whatever information you may be able to obtain in regard to the annual

                            you are accredited, to lay before it the considerations set forth in the
                            first three paragraphs of this instruction, to emphasize the fact that
                            the general basis on which exports from the United States to the other
                            American Republics will be authorized will be that of previous imports
                            by those republics, and to urge that any requests which the Government
                            to which you are accredited may desire to make for an unusual quantity
                            of any given commodity should be presented in the near future in order
                            that these requests may receive the most favorable consideration
                            possible. Any such requests should be accompanied by an explanation of
                            the need for the commodity and of the use to which it is to be put in
                            the importing country.</p>
                        <p>In bringing this matter to the attention of the Government to which you
                            are accredited you should, of course, make it clear that the United

                            circular instruction of December 12, 1940 regarding the export of
                            articles and materials under Section 6 of the National Defense Act of
                            July 2, 1940. You are instructed to obtain at an early opportunity an
                            audience with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to communicate to him
                            the substance of the following message:</p>
                        <p>The first three paragraphs of the Department’s circular instruction of
                            December 12, 1940 outlined the principles on which this Government has
                            been licensing the export to the other American republics of commodities
                            important in our national defense program. With the rapid development of
                            the defense program, and the great increase in the demand for numerous
                            raw materials, a situation of scarcity has developed with respect to
                            many items. A tight situation now exists with respect to aluminum, zinc,
                            nickel, copper, manganese, tin and tungsten, among other materials,
                            while the supply of iron and steel is falling behind demand. On a number
                            of items, including machine tools, aluminum and nickel, specific
                            priorities for domestic consumption within the United States have been
                            imposed.</p>
                        <p>Faced with this situation the Government of the United States is seeking
                            and must obtain the fullest cooperation of all of the other American
                            republics if it is to be able to maintain its policy of the most liberal
                            possible licensing of exports to the other American republics. It is
                            this Government’s opinion that such cooperation could most
                            advantageously take the form of the imposition by each of the other
                            American republics of a system of export control over: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                        <item>The United States will continue to permit exports to
                                            the other American republics in all cases unless United
                                            States stocks of the commodity in question are
                                            dangerously small or are essential <pb n="152"
                                                xml:id="pg_152" facs="0162"/>to our own defense
                                            program. In the cases of products the supply of which is
                                            not affected by these considerations an attempt will be
                                            made to issue licenses freely for use within the
                                            American republics or at least in amounts up to the
                                            recent import requirements of the nations in question.
                                            On such products export control by the nations in
                                            question would be satisfactory if it restricted exports
                                            except to other American countries which impose similar
                                            export control. Where such a system of export control is
                                            imposed by the nations in question, it may be possible
                                            to grant general licenses for export of certain
                                            categories of products similar to that recently extended
                                            in the case of Cuba. (A copy of press release no. 130
                                            relating to the general license for exports to Cuba is

                                        <item>In the case of articles the United States supply of
                                            which is less than the demands made by our national
                                            defense program, our own consumption, and the
                                            requirements of the other American republics, it will be
                                            necessary to impose some relative scale of priorities
                                            which would of course change from time to time. In these
                                            cases an effort will be made, if it is at all possible,
                                            to fulfill the most urgent requirements of the other
                                            American republics, deferring fulfillment of less urgent
                                            requirements until the supply situation improves. In
                                            these cases it will be necessary that this Government be
                                            assured that materials so exported reach their specific
                                            destinations, and that no re-export, even to other
                                            American countries, be permitted.</item>

                                            Moreover, you may make it clear, without making any
                                            positive commitment, that in the event such measures of
                                            control and regulation are undertaken, this Government
                                            stands ready to give consideration to purchasing
                                            supplies of such commodities as a regular part of its

                                            regulated in such a way as to give the United States
                                            prior opportunity to acquire them.</item>

                        <p>253. Department’s no. 149, March 28, 6:00 p.m., and your no. 242, April
                            1, 4:00 p.m., and no. 344, April 23, 11 a.m.<note n="5" xml:id="d187fn1"
                                >None printed.</note> The Department has, since dispatching its
                            above-mentioned telegram, discussed the question of general licenses
                            with the representatives of a number of other American republics. As a
                            result of these discussions the Department has determined that it would
                            be justified in issuing a general license for the export of a given
                            commodity to a given country only if that country will totally prohibit
                            the export of the commodity, whether imported from the United States or
                            elsewhere or domestically produced, except to the United States and
                            other American republics having similar export control systems.
                            Otherwise it is clear that the commodity might be imported from the
                            United States in such <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0164"
                            />quantities as to release for export to unsatisfactory destinations
                            other quantities of the same commodity produced domestically or imported
                            from elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the fact that this modification of the Department’s
                            policy had not occurred when the question was taken up with the
                            Brazilian Government last month and that that Government has corrected
                            its export control law in the sense which the Department requested at
                            that time, the Department does not wish further to delay the issuance of
                            general licenses to Brazil and is recommending to the appropriate
                            American authorities that such licenses be authorized as soon as
                            possible. Since, however, all the other American Republics are being
                            asked to prohibit the export of the commodities for which general
                            licenses are issued in the United States, the Department feels it
                            necessary to make the same request of the Brazilian Government and will
                            proceed with the issuance of general licenses in the expectation that
                            Brazil will promptly prohibit the export, except to the destinations
                            indicated in the preceding paragraph, of those commodities for which
                            such licenses are issued.</p>
                        <p>In bringing this matter to the attention of the Brazilian authorities,
                            please emphasize that general licenses cannot in any case be issued for
                            the export of certain commodities of which the United States has only a
                            meagre exportable surplus or no surplus whatsoever.</p>

                            It is requested that information identical with that sought in regard to

                            the articles and materials listed in the above-mentioned schedules which

                            of December 12. Advantage may be taken of the opportunity to point out,
                            in those countries in which a system of export control has not yet been
                            adopted, that the adoption of such a system will facilitate the issuance
                            of export licenses in the United States and that it will be possible to
                            issue general licenses in the case of many of these additional
                            commodities if the other American republic has in its turn prohibited
                            their export to destinations other than the United States and American

                        <p>In connection with recent telegrams and instructions from the Department
                            having to do with export control and recommending that the other
                            American republics prohibit exports except to the United States and to
                            American republics having export control systems, the Department does
                            not, of course, wish to interfere in any way with exports to the British
                            Empire. This statement of policy is conveyed to you for your own
                            information and not for formal transmittal to the government to which
                            you are accredited. Should that government, however, raise the question

                        </p>
                        <p>The broad program in which the United States is engaged of production of
                            materials and equipment essential to national and continental defense
                            has led to a situation of scarcity with respect to many commodities and
                            the establishment by the United States of a system of control of the
                            export and, in many cases, the domestic consumption of such items. At
                            the present time some sixty percent, by value, of the articles exported
                            from the United States are subject to export licensing and/or
                            priorities.</p>
                        <p>It is the objective of this policy on the one hand to restrict the
                            exportation, and in some cases domestic consumption, of goods produced
                            in the United States to amounts consistent with the demands of the
                            defense program, while on the other hand to facilitate in so far as is
                            feasible the exportation to the other American nations of at least their
                            essential import requirements, and in general as large amounts of
                            particular United States products as are consistent with the exigencies
                            of defense. A separate but related phase of policy concerns the
                            acquisition abroad of strategic materials essential to the defense
                            program, and, in general, the utilization of the materials of the
                            Hemisphere in the continental defense.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of the United States that these objectives are of interest
                            and importance to all of the American republics, and that they may best
                            be realized by the creation of an inter-American system of export
                            control involving strict restriction and control of the exportation of
                            products outside of the Western Hemisphere with a maximum of free
                            commerce within the Hemisphere which is compatible with defense
                            requirements. To this end the United States has been seeking in
                            individual conversations the fullest cooperation of all of the American
                            republics, and it is the opinion of the Government of the United States
                            that such cooperation could most advantageously <pb n="157"

                                            issue general licenses to products in this category for
                                            export to American republics which also control the

                                            imported from the United States or elsewhere or produced
                                            domestically. Such general licenses greatly facilitate
                                            trade among the American republics.</item>

                                            will continue to be necessary to impose a system of
                                            priorities as between the demands of the defense
                                            program, the requirements of the other American
                                            republics, and civilian consumption in the United
                                            States. In these cases it will at best be possible to
                                            grant priorities for only the most urgent requirements
                                            of the other American republics, and, in view of the
                                            control thus obtained, it will be possible to simplify
                                            the administrative procedure by issuing general licenses
                                            for the exportation of articles for which such

                                            will be necessary to impose some quantitative
                                            restriction on exports, and, in many cases, on domestic
                                            consumption. In all of these cases an effort will be
                                            made, if it is at all possible, to fulfill the most
                                            urgent requirements of the other American republics,

                            response, and, indeed, many of the other American republics had already
                            embarked on similar and related courses of action. At the present time
                            all of the American republics have established, or are actively
                            considering, some form of export control directed to ends similar to
                            those set forth above. As a result, the United States has been in a
                            position already to issue general licenses for the export to Argentina,

                        <p>As is inevitable, the several systems of export control already imposed
                            or in contemplation, although they point towards the same end, differ
                            considerably in scope and form. There arise as a result a number of
                            practical problems such as for example the question of the control only
                            of the re-exportation of articles imported from one particular country
                            as contrasted with control over all exports of the particular articles,
                            whether imported from any source or produced domestically. Another
                            problem which gives rise to extensive and complex administrative
                            difficulties lies in application by the several republics of controls to
                            varying lists or groups of commodities. As a result, the United States,
                            and other nations, have been compelled to limit the issuance of general
                            licenses and to restrict the exportation and re-exportation of the goods
                            therein covered to such other American republics as happen to control
                            the particular item.</p>
                        <p>Commerce among the American nations can obviously be made most free under
                            present world conditions which have occasioned the imposition of all of
                            these types of export control, if all of the American republics adopt
                            parallel systems of export control thus <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159"

                            Chairman of the Advisory Committee, the United States member, with
                            reference to organization for considering and handling export control
                            and related policies by the American republics.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>It is the view of the Subcommittee that it is desirable and necessary to
                            devote the materials and products of the Western Hemisphere primarily to
                            the defense of the Hemisphere. This objective may be best realized, and
                            at the same time the essential import requirements of the American
                            republics fulfilled in so far as is feasible, by the creation in each of
                            the American republics of parallel systems of export control involving
                            strict restrictions and control of the exportation of products outside
                            of the Western Hemisphere with a maximum of free commerce within the
                            Hemisphere which is compatible with defense requirements.</p>
                        <p>The Subcommittee believes that the general problem may be considered in
                            four principal aspects: <list>

                                    regarding the supply situation of the various important

                        <p>Some steps towards the establishment of export controls have been taken
                            by all of the American republics, and the Subcommittee has had before it
                            for study the legislation on the subject of thirteen American republics,
                            copies of which are also annexed.<note n="12" xml:id="d191fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> As is inevitable, these systems differ considerably
                            in scope and form. Some are limited to specific lists of commodities;
                            others empower the Executive Power to control, at its discretion, the
                            various categories of materials and products. A few envisage the control
                            at once of all exportation, while one, at least, would control all
                            products controlled in other American republics. In view of the
                            development of its manufacturing for export, and its role in production
                            for national and continental defense, the United States of America has
                            imposed one or another form of control over more than sixty percent of
                            its export trade, and its representative has made the following
                            statement of policy in the discourse mentioned above: <quote

                                    goods produced in the United States to amounts consistent with

                                    as is feasible the exportation to the other American nations of
                                    at least their essential import requirements, and in general as
                                    large amounts of particular United States products as are
                                    consistent with the exigencies of defense.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>From the variation in the scope and form of the several systems of export
                            control now in vogue there arise a number of practical problems such as
                            for example the question of the control only of the re-exportation of
                            articles imported from one particular country as contrasted with control
                            over all exports of the particular articles, whether imported from any
                            source or produced domestically. Another problem which gives rise to
                            extensive and complex administrative difficulties lies in application by
                            the several republics of controls to varying lists or categories of
                            commodities. As a result, certain American republics have been compelled
                            to limit the issuance of general licenses and to permit the free
                            exportation and re-exportation of the goods therein covered only to such
                            other American republics as happen to control the particular item.</p>
                        <p>Commerce among the American nations can obviously be made most free under
                            the present world conditions which have occasioned the imposition of all
                            these types of export control, if all of the American republics adopt
                            parallel systems of export control, thus establishing an inter-American
                            system: To this end it is recommended that appropriate legislation be
                            adopted in each of the American republics providing that: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                        <p>In order to have a better understanding, enclosed herewith is a
                            memorandum prepared by the Delegate of Costa Rica referring to this

                        <p>Obviously such parallel systems of control will be most effective in
                            making possible the greatest feasible quantities of essential import

                            exercise such control to the greatest degree attainable over identical

                        <p>The broad program in which the United States is engaged of production of
                            materials and equipment essential to national and continental defense
                            has led to a situation of scarcity with respect to many commodities, and
                            the establishment by the United States of a system of control of the
                            export and the domestic consumption of such items. In order to cooperate
                            with the United States in its policy of facilitating, as far as
                            possible, to the other American republics the supply of their essential
                            import requirements, accurate information is needed whereby an
                            estimation of these requirements of each American republic can be

                        <p>The Secretary of State informs the Ambassador that while as yet the
                            question does not appear to have arisen, it is likely that in the
                            current negotiations for the acquisition of various strategic materials
                            from Chile the point will be made by the Chilean Government that
                            contracts existing as of the date of the agreement should be excepted
                            from the export embargo prohibiting the export of the materials except
                            to the United States and the other American republics. This question
                            has, of course, arisen in several of the other purchase agreements which
                            have been entered into with the other American republics. In the
                            Brazilian agreement the matter was not as carefully considered as it
                            should have been and the result was that existing contracts which had
                            been registered in accordance with Brazilian practice were excepted from
                            the embargo. The amount of existing contracts was not important in the
                            Mexican agreement, and the question therefore did not arise. In Peru,
                            however, the Department has insisted successfully on a complete embargo
                            without exception of existing contracts except for minor amounts of two
                            materials which were conceded as a matter of expediency. In the current
                            Argentine negotiations Ambassador Armour has been requested to insist
                            that no exception be made as to pre-existing agreements. It is suggested
                            that if this question arises the following arguments may be used in
                            resisting the request. First, the prohibition by the Chilean Government
                            contained in the export embargo would not constitute a violation of the
                            preexisting agreements but would merely be the intervention of the
                            Government acting under its sovereign power so as to make impossible the
                            performance of contracts entered into by private parties; secondly, that
                            the United States export control system contains no exception of
                            existing contracts.</p>

                            the Department has been giving the most active consideration to the
                            important problem of furnishing Chile and the other American republics
                            with material essential for their economic life, and has taken the
                            matter up frequently with the other interested agencies of the
                            Government of the United States. The economic services of the Department
                            have been reorganized with a view toward improving the efficiency of
                            planning and carrying out policies in respect to such matters, while the

                            has taken over and is thoroughly reorganizing the work of handling
                            export licenses as well as the problem of clearing priorities and
                            allocations. Moreover, the establishment of the Supply Priorities and
                            Allocations Board and the reorganization of the Office of Production
                            Management all tend in the direction of greatly increased efficiencies
                            of operation. The work of reorganization and facilitation of procedure
                            has not been completed, but the Department is very hopeful that
                            procedurally many difficulties will be removed.</p>
                        <p>It would not be proper for you to get the impression that the basic
                            situation of scarcity of supply is improving. Quite the contrary, as
                            time progresses and the defense program broadens the scarcity of many
                            materials and other strategic products, as well as of fabricating plant
                            and equipment, becomes more pronounced. Severe curtailment of civilian
                            consumption is now the order of the day in the United States and it will
                            not be possible to obtain allocations of materials for the other
                            American republics which do not entail a considerable amount of
                            curtailment of civilian consumption there.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Department and the other agencies of the Government are
                            making great strides in the collection of information regarding the
                            minimum essential needs of the other American republics, broken down by
                            commodities and by uses. These are being submitted to the Supply
                            Priorities and Allocations Board, and it is hoped that within the near
                            future definite allocations will be made for export to the other
                            American republics. If it is possible to have such allocations made for
                            a three or six months period the Department and the Defense Board will
                            then be in a position to act promptly on individual applications made
                            through the interested governments.</p>
                        <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>I must point out that these remarks of mine are preliminary, and that
                            final decisions as to method of carrying out allocation policy have not
                            yet been taken.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the specific complaints of Chile with respect to copper
                            and iron and steel products, the Department has recently telegraphed
                            you. As a matter of fact, the Economic Defense Board and the OPM have
                            outstanding specific instructions to act promptly on all applications
                            for copper products to Chile, Peru, and Mexico, the sources of the raw
                            material. Even so, I must repeat that the arguments advanced by the
                            Chileans are not entirely reasonable, since one of the very great
                            shortages within the United States is of productive facilities for
                            fabricating these metals. In the case of copper much of the shortage
                            lies in fabricating facilities as well as in the raw material. The
                            situation in iron and steel is even more acute, since supplies of iron
                            ore are relatively plentiful, while blast furnaces and other steel
                            manufacturing facilities are deficient.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: A number of diplomatic missions and
                            consular offices in the other American republics have requested that
                            they be furnished with information showing the sacrifices being made in
                            the United States by industry and consumers because of the current
                            shortage of strategic materials required for the national defense
                            effort. This material has been requested to assist diplomatic and
                            consular officers in answering charges in governmental and private
                            circles that the United States is itself not making sacrifices
                            commensurate with the ones the other American republics are called upon
                            to suffer.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a memorandum indicating some of the sacrifices which
                            the American manufacturing and consuming public have been called on to
                            make because of material shortages. It is hoped that this information
                            will be of assistance to you in explaining officially and privately that
                            at least equal treatment is being sought in every instance for the
                            requests of the other American republics and that extensive sacrifices
                            are being made in this country. While it is not desired that officers
                            carry on any concerted campaign to get these data before the public in
                            the country to which you are accredited, nevertheless it may be possible
                            in your discretion to use the material <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166"

                                    Shortage of Strategic Materials</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>It is not generally realized, in countries outside the United States
                                unable to obtain desired American supplies, to what extent the
                                defense program has entailed sacrifices within the United States.
                                Civilian needs have been severely cut, much “priority unemployment”
                                has developed and many manufacturers, particularly those whose
                                plants are not readily adaptable to defense production, have been
                                compelled to reduce greatly their operations or to close. In spite
                                of plans to alleviate the situation by the Supply Priorities and
                                Allocations Board, by giving special consideration to “hardship”
                                cases, it appears inevitable as more and more of the national effort
                                is devoted to defense, that many industries will be adversely
                                affected to an ever increasing degree.</p>
                            <p>No general discussion or outline of the national defense program can
                                be given in this brief memorandum. The policy of the United States
                                government to make the United States the arsenal of democracy has
                                been amply conveyed to the field in speeches of the President and of
                                various officers of the government. The Department is making every
                                effort to keep the field supplied with current information. In
                                addition to data contained in the Department’s Radio Bulletin,
                                various publications have been forwarded, including copies of the
                                most recent issue of the Comprehensive Export Control Schedule, No.
                                4; a pamphlet entitled “Materials for Defense” issued by the Office
                                of Emergency Management containing a series of eleven articles on

                                Republics and arrangements are being made to dispatch it to consular
                                offices.</p>

                            <p>However, a few brief comments might be made on the defense program.
                                Appropriations have already been made totaling over sixty billion
                                dollars. The problem was considered by many a year and a half ago
                                when the defense program first got under way, to see how such a
                                program could be set upon the top of a regular business framework of
                                our economy; today, the problem is to find to what extent and in
                                what manner the regular business framework can be set on top of the
                                defense program. Official estimates indicate that about eighteen
                                percent of our industrial effort is now devoted to defense and that
                                within twelve months this percentage will probably reach between 45
                                to 50 percent with a probability of even greater increase
                                thereafter. The effect of this change-over upon industry’s ability
                                to supply civilian requirements is obvious. There is the further
                                factor that civilian demand, owing to large general expenditures,
                                has very greatly increased.</p>
                            <p>Instrumentalities and methods of control to achieve the end of
                                supplying defense production with needed raw materials include the
                                system of priorities, the subject of the Department’s circular
                                instruction of October 22, 1941, file 810–20 Defense/1638a,<note
                                    n="19" xml:id="d194fn2">Not printed.</note> inventory control,
                                allocation of raw materials, limitation orders prohibiting the use
                                of specific materials in certain finished products, limitation of
                                production as in the case of automobiles, the development of the use
                                of substitutes, the standardization of manufacture as for example in
                                planes of the same general type ordered by various airlines, the
                                redrafting of specifications such as those of building codes,
                                reducing wherever possible the use of particularly critical
                                materials, and requisition by the Army and Navy. Compliance with the
                                various orders involved is being vigorously enforced and severe
                                penalties have already been imposed upon violators.</p>
                            <p>It would appear possible that at least some of these measures could
                                be adopted in some of the American Republics, particularly the use
                                of substitute materials. Nine thousand tons of tin per year are now
                                being saved in the United States by a slight reduction in the
                                thickness of tinplate for cans.</p>
                            <p>A definite trend towards extension of the system of allocating raw
                                materials has been evident in the past few months, replacing in
                                effect the use of priorities.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Donald M. Nelson, Executive Director of the Supply Priorities and
                                Allocation Board, was reported on November 13 as stating that the
                                priorities system had reached the point where critical shortages of
                                materials threatened its complete collapse. He stated that within a
                                few months the government might have to begin rationing supplies to
                                industries and that he could think of no civilian which would get
                                    <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0178"/>all of the materials he
                                would like to have. The less essential the industry is to the
                                national well being, the sharper will be the curtailment. The
                                necessity of greatly reducing the scope of their operations and in
                                many instances of being forced entirely out of business is already
                                clear for many industries. In the case of many critical items,
                                shortages are so severe that even a high priority rating does not
                                enable the holder to obtain supplies because of the higher ratings
                                issued and the short supply available. As stated by Mr. Nelson on
                                November 7 before the Associated Manufacturers of America, there is
                                no way by which we can make all of the things we have to make in
                                national defense and lead a normal commercial life on top of it
                                all.</p>
                            <p>An official of the Division of Priorities of the Office of Production
                                Management stated on November 13, “the ratio of civilian demand to
                                available supply for aluminum is ten to one, today: ten orders for a
                                ton of aluminum, to every ton of aluminum that can be sold. There
                                are three customers for every ton of copper, four for every ton of
                                brass, two for every ton of steel—and in greater or lesser degree
                                the same kind of ratios apply to all of the other critical metals,
                                to most of the important chemicals, and to many of our basic
                                fibres”.</p>
                            <p>A press release of November 7 reported that preparation of allocation
                                of all critical materials throughout American industry was called
                                for on that day by parallel actions of the Supply Priorities and
                                Allocations Board and the Office of Production Management. SPAB
                                announced that it would authorize its executive director to obtain
                                detailed production programs for 1942. It is a program which will
                                take considerable time to put into effect; it is expected to give
                                defense officials a clear over-all picture of the nation’s total
                                requirements for raw materials.</p>
                            <p>The following outline of some of the restrictions and prohibitions
                                imposed on domestic industry will serve as examples.</p>
                            <p>Production of automobiles for the first six months of the model year,
                                beginning August 1941 and ending January 1942, will show a drop of
                                at least 36.3 percent. The cut for August, September and November
                                was 26.5 percent; for December it will be 48.4 percent and for
                                January 1942, at least 51 percent. Before the model year is over on
                                July 31, 1942, the drop in output of passenger cars will probably be
                                much greater since manufacturers of passenger cars receive no
                                general preference rating to enable them to obtain raw materials or
                                component parts such as truck manufacturers receive.</p>
                            <p>Washers and ironers for domestic use were cut 17.3 percent for the
                                period August 1 to December 31, 1941. Further cuts may come.</p>
                            <p>Of the total United States production of paper and paper products
                                defense will take at least 30 percent so that civilian needs will
                                have to be curtailed by that or a greater amount.</p>

                            <p>Under an order of October 21, 1941 the use of copper as a component
                                part of more than 100 types of civilian articles was restricted 40
                                percent for the remainder of 1941 and completely prohibited after
                                January 1, 1942. Savings, it is hoped, will go far to strengthen our
                                copper position and, avoid a shortage. Some of the more striking
                                items affected are: a long list of automobile and garage equipment;
                                an extensive list of building supplies and hardware; all kinds of
                                burial equipment; dressmaking accessories; house furnishings and
                                equipment, including office and institutional items; household
                                appliances, including fans, heaters, stoves, upholsterers’ supplies,
                                lamp stands, shades, et cetera; jewelry and novelties; and a
                                miscellaneous collection such as beauty parlor equipment and barber
                                shop supplies, beverage-dispensing units, bicycles, motorcycles,
                                fire extinguishers, keys and locks, ladders and hoists, livestock
                                and poultry equipment, photographic equipment, radios, street signs,
                                vending machines, and office supplies.</p>
                            <p>The Supply Priorities and Allocations Board announced October 9 a new
                                policy under which no public or private construction projects which
                                use critical materials such as steel, copper, brass, bronze,
                                aluminum, et cetera, may be started during the emergency unless
                                these projects are either necessary for direct national defense or
                                are essential to the health and safety of the people. This applies
                                to public projects—Federal, State, and local—such as the building of
                                post offices, courthouses, and similar structures; to the
                                construction of roads and highways; to river and harbor
                                improvements; and to flood control and power projects. It applies to
                                the construction of factories, lofts, warehouses, office buildings
                                and all other commercial construction. It applies to residential
                                construction and to construction for public utilities.</p>
                            <p>By an order issued by the Director of Priorities on October 30,
                                electric power was rationed in seven states of the Southeast. Large
                                power consumption by defense industries, particularly aluminum
                                plants, coupled with a severe drought necessitated power
                                conservation. The program calls for the curtailment of power by
                                large commercial and industrial users in seven states, effective
                                November 10; the immediate discontinuance of the use of power for
                                such non-essential services as sign lighting, show window lighting
                                and floodlighting of athletic fields; and the immediate mandatory
                                pooling of power by inter-connecting systems of 40 publicly and
                                privately owned companies in 13 states.</p>
                            <p>On November 8, the use of cellophane and similar transparent
                                materials derived from cellulose was ordered by the priorities
                                division of OPM in the interest of national defense for curtailment.
                                Some of the items affected are: the packaging of razor blades,
                                cosmetics and soap, candles and wax products, decorations and
                                novelties.</p>
                            <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0180"/>
                            <p>It was reported during the second week of November that shortage of
                                ships for war supplies to Britain and Russia and the corresponding
                                tightness of scarce materials to the United States will shortly
                                become reflected in a number of industries. The question to be
                                decided by OPM officials is whether shipping allocations of non-war
                                materials should be cut now as a conservative measure or later as
                                the war effort demands. A cut of this character would make possible
                                the bringing in of larger quantities of manganese, ore, rubber, tin,
                                tungsten and other source materials.</p>
                            <p>Shortages of kraft pulp and of the supply of chlorine have affected
                                the production of kraft paper. Due to the increasing demand for
                                defense purposes, the allocations of chlorine for paper production
                                will be further reduced shortly. The industries using kraft paper
                                are through conservation and curtailment of use reducing the
                                civilian demand.</p>
                            <p>The following quotations from recent speeches by Donald M. Nelson,
                                Executive Director, Supply Priorities and Allocations Board, may be
                                of use: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The simplest explanation is that the national defense job we
                                        have taken on is so enormous that it is going to change the
                                        pace and scope of every other job in America. In all history
                                        no nation ever set out to do so much in so short a time. We
                                        would not be attempting it if to do anything less would make
                                        us safe. We cannot succeed unless we give the job everything
                                        we have. It means that on all of the important materials we
                                        use military requirements come first. Modern war eats metals
                                        at an unimaginable rate. It is hard to think of one
                                        important metal of which, after our military needs have been
                                        met, there will be anything remotely like enough to meet all
                                        the ordinary civilian demands. We are going to run short on
                                        everything. These shortages are overall shortages. They mean
                                        that we can get through this crisis only by cutting down on
                                        the amounts that go to civilian industry.</p>
                                    <p>These are not minor inconveniences that we have been talking
                                        about today. They are major hardships. They are obviously
                                        going to mean that many factories, many business men and
                                        many workers can no longer produce the things they have been
                                        producing. That is going to bring extremely difficult
                                        problems to many cities. I cannot pretend that the period of
                                        adjustment which is now beginning is going to be an easy one
                                        to get through. Yet it would be equally wrong to pretend
                                        that the problem is insoluble, or to say that we are just
                                        naturally doomed to have a depression which we cannot remedy
                                        grow up inside of our tremendous defense effort.”</p>

                        <p>Please communicate the following statement to the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs and give it appropriate publicity. Please emphasize to the
                            government the importance of its cooperating fully, especially in the
                            establishment of the National Oil Pool Committee, as the success of the
                            plan depends upon full cooperation. The representatives of the principal
                            United States oil companies have been instructed by their home offices
                            regarding the plan.</p>
                        <p>The problems of delivering petroleum products to the other American
                            Republics and to the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, in view of
                            the tanker shortage arising out of the withdrawal of tankers in order to
                            supply petroleum to Britain, have received a great amount of publicity
                            during recent weeks and are well known.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States believes that the interests of the
                            Western Hemisphere will best be served if the reduction in available
                            tanker tonnage is distributed in such a way as to bring about equality
                            among all the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of this Government that such equality will be achieved if
                            the same percentage reduction in the total amount of petroleum products
                            moved by tankers is applied in the case of each of the other American
                            Republics and to shipments to the Atlantic coast of the United
                            States—adjusted as may be necessary and possible, from time to time, to
                            avoid manifest inequalities arising out of special circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is convinced that if the maximum
                            utilization of the tanker tonnage available for these services is to be
                            attained, there will be required the fullest possible cooperation among
                            the Governments of the American Republics and the organizations engaged
                            in the production, transportation and distribution of petroleum
                            products.</p>
                        <p>In order best to contribute on its part to the realization of these
                            objectives and to the efficient use of tankers under the control of the
                                <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0182"/>United States, the
                            Government of the United States has already established an American
                            Tanker Committee. This Committee will be charged with the proper
                            allocation between the several areas of the world of the total tanker
                            tonnage under United States control, and will thus have the task of
                            translating the share-and-share-alike policy above outlined into
                            quantitative terms. Its actions will be subject to approval and review
                            by the Petroleum Coordinator and the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The tankers allocated by the American Tanker Committee to inter-American
                            services will be under the jurisdiction of the Petroleum Supply
                            Committee for Latin America, which will be charged with operating a pool
                            of the United States facilities for the distribution of petroleum to and
                            in the other American Republics. This Committee, which has already been
                            established, has the task of correlating the available facilities for
                            distribution with the needs of the various American Republics in
                            accordance with the enunciated principle of equality of treatment. It
                            will report to the Petroleum Coordinator on operating matters and to the
                            Department of State in connection with policy or other matters involving
                            relations with other governments.</p>
                        <p>While this plan at present is necessarily limited to the operations of
                            the petroleum facilities of the United States, the benefits of which it
                            is capable can not be realized unless the same plan be adopted by all of
                            the American Republics, and unless the principles upon which its
                            successful operation depend are accepted and observed by all
                            organizations within those Republics which are engaged in the
                            production, transportation and distribution of petroleum products. This
                            close cooperation can best be attained, in the opinion of the Government
                            of the United States, by the establishment in each of the other American
                            Republics by appropriate action of national oil pool committees on which
                            would be represented the Government and each of the principal oil
                            supplying organizations, national or private. The Government of the
                            United States is already taking up with the Governments of each of the
                            other American Republics the establishment of such national committees.
                            Each national committee, subject to directions from its own government,
                            would determine the current imported oil requirements of the country and
                            would communicate them to the Petroleum Supply Committee for Latin
                            America.</p>
                        <p>The Petroleum Supply Committee, with the composite picture of all
                            requirements before it, and the combined transport and receiving port
                            facilities of all participants at its disposal for this purpose, will be
                            in a position to dispatch the available tanker tonnage under its
                            jurisdiction in such a way as to achieve maximum transport efficiency,
                            and equality of both burden and benefit among all countries which join
                            in the plan.</p>
                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0183"/>
                        <p>An essential requirement of this plan is that each organization engaged
                            in supplying oil to the American Republics must use its facilities for
                            producing, transporting, or distributing petroleum with maximum
                            efficiency and with due regard to the principle of equality of treatment
                            among all the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>Commercially competitive interests must be made subordinate to the
                            interests of national and hemispheric defense.</p>
                        <p>It is the intention of the United States to make every possible effort to
                            assist in fulfilling the petroleum requirements of the other American
                            Republics. The Government of the United States believes that the method
                            outlined will accomplish this purpose, if it receives the wholehearted
                            support of all of the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>This statement will also be made by the United States representative at
                            the next meeting of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee.</p>

                        <p>1241. Department’s circular telegram of August 30, 5 p.m. An oil pool of
                            the most important American and British companies has been operating
                            here since June 23 with the full knowledge and support of the National
                            Petroleum Council of the Brazilian Government. The president of the
                            National Petroleum Council told the representatives of the oil pool
                            today that he would co-operate with them in accordance with the
                            Department’s plan. However, in view of the close relationship now
                            existing it feels it is not necessary for the Government officially to
                            appoint a member to the board.</p>

                            American Tanker Committee, a dependency of the Petroleum Supply
                            Committee for Latin America, and also pointing out that the best manner
                            to secure close cooperation in the production, transportation and
                            distribution of petroleum products would be that the other American
                            Republics would establish national committees for the administration of
                            oil pools.</p>
                        <p>The matter was submitted to the consideration of the competent
                            authorities, and the Government of Mexico has reached the following
                            conclusions:</p>
                        <p>As the oil industry of the Republic is managed by one institution, this
                            being of a national character, it is not considered necessary to
                            establish the Committee suggested by the North American Government, for
                            all oil tankers are under the control of “Petróleos Mexicanos”, an
                            organization which is perfectly qualified to make the arrangements
                            considered necessary by the authorities of the United States of America
                            regarding the needs for petroleum, of Mexico, and of the other nations
                            of this Continent as well.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs kindly asks
                            the Embassy of the United States of America in this capital to notify
                            its Government that Petróleos Mexicanos—which for the practical effects
                            could be considered as the National Committee referred to in the
                            Memorandum of the 3d instant—is willing to cooperate towards the
                            attainment of the ends pursued, and that it considers that these ends
                            can be reached in a more effective manner without the necessity of
                            creating a new organization.</p>
                        <p>It must be pointed out that the tankers controlled at present by
                            Petróleos Mexicanos are destined to take care of the internal
                            necessities of the country and to relieve, in part, the situation
                            created in the eastern coast of the United States and in several
                            countries of this Continent, by the lack of means of transportation.</p>

                            companies as follows: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>It includes a sub-committee and a working committee, both appointed from
                            officials in these companies. The committee was unofficially formed in
                            the month of June of this year. While the National Petroleum Council is
                            not officially represented, the head of the Petroleum Council, General
                            Horta Barbosa, is its unofficial chairman and the committee’s policy is
                            that of closest cooperation with the National Petroleum Council. The oil
                            companies were at first apprehensive that the committee might be
                            considered as contrary to the Brazilian anti-trust laws but experienced
                            no difficulty in having its formation approved by the National Petroleum
                            Council. As pointed out in my telegram No. 1241 of September 9, Noon,
                            there seemed to be no necessity for the National Petroleum Council or
                            any other department of the Brazilian Government to be officially
                            represented on the committee.</p>
                        <p>The Latin American Petroleum Supply Committee in New York advises the
                            committee here of tanker space available for Brazil which is then
                            divided equitably between the companies, but no completely satisfactory
                            solution has been arrived at regarding equitable distribution of
                            products in this country. It was at first thought that quotas <pb
                                n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0186"/>for petroleum products might be
                            assigned to the individual municipalities in Brazil, but this plan did
                            not meet with the approval of the National Petroleum Council. At
                            present, consumer quotas are based on the first six months consumption
                            in 1941 by states. (It so happens that there is only one point of
                            importation in each state in Brazil.)</p>
                        <p>The committee’s chief problem here is in supplying fuel oil for
                            industrial use, and it is felt by them that, while clean tanker space
                            has been made available in sufficient quantity, the lack of dirty tanker
                            space is a matter of some concern.</p>
                        <p>No provisions appear to have been made for a system of rationing although
                            the National Petroleum Council has, since June of this year, been
                            “studying the matter”. The National Petroleum Council has also been
                            reluctant to indicate which industries should receive preference and
                            which should make sacrifices. The Federação das Industries is
                            cooperating with the committee in trying to solve the problems of fuel
                            saving in the São Paulo industrial region, chiefly by suggesting
                            improvements in present combustion methods.</p>
                        <p>As the matter stands at present, the National Petroleum Council has
                            requested that the following proportions of Brazil’s consumption of
                            petroleum products be maintained: aviation gasoline 100 percent; diesel
                            oil 100 percent; fuel oil 85 percent; kerosene 100 percent. In order to
                            accomplish this, motor gasoline imports would have to be cut to 75
                            percent of the 1940 consumption. The maintaining of these proportions
                            would mean roughly a 22 percent cut in tanker space, which is
                            approximately what the New York committee has removed from the Brazilian
                            trade.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s circular telegram of August 30, 1941, containing a
                            statement to be communicated to the Uruguayan Minister of Foreign
                            Relations regarding measures taken by our Government to assure the
                            delivery of petroleum products to the other American Republics.</p>
                        <p>The full text of the statement was communicated to the Uruguayan Foreign
                            Office in a note dated September 1. I handed the note personally to Dr.
                                Guani<note n="6" xml:id="d201fn1">Alberto Guani, Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> and in so doing I emphasized the importance
                            of the cooperation of the Uruguayan Government, with particular
                            reference to the establishment of a National Oil Pool Committee. I told
                            Dr. Guani at the same time that it was desired that appropriate
                            publicity be given the statement, adding that I would be guided by his
                            wishes as to whether the text should be furnished to the press by the
                            Foreign Office or by the Embassy. He replied that he would be glad to
                            take care of the matter and in due course the Foreign Office transmitted
                            to the press a communiqué, the text of which I enclose as published in
                                <hi rend="italic">La Mañana</hi> on September 4,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d201fn2">Not reprinted.</note> It may be noted that the
                            Spanish translation of the Department’s statement given in the
                            communiqué is that prepared by Mr. Joseph F. Walker of the Embassy
                            staff. (In order to obtain prompt consideration on the part of the
                            Foreign Office, the Embassy finds it necessary in all important cases to
                            transmit with its notes Spanish translations which bear the caption
                            “Traducción—No Oficial”.)</p>
                        <p>In my interview with Dr. Guani, he assured me that the matter would be
                            given early consideration. However, it was not until September 24, that
                            any positive action was taken and then this action <pb n="178"
                                xml:id="pg_178" facs="0188"/>was in the form of a decree (the text
                            of which is enclosed)<note n="8" xml:id="d201fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            designating an Advisory Board (Comisión Asesora) charged with studying
                            the matter and submitting a report within eight days. This Board is made
                            up of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Industries
                            and Labor, the Ancap,<note n="9" xml:id="d201fn4">Administratión
                                Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol, y Portland.</note> and the
                            recently instituted Board for the Rationing of Fuel.</p>
                        <p>Following the publication of the decree, I asked the local
                            representatives of the West India Oil Company and the Atlantic Refining
                            Company to call at the Embassy in order that I might discuss the
                            situation with them before seeing Dr. Guani, with whom I had an
                            appointment last evening. (As the Department is aware, these two
                            companies import their own fuel oil which is refined for them by the
                            Ancap. On the other hand the Texas Oil Company, although represented
                            here and engaged in the distribution of refined products obtained from
                            the Ancap, does not import its own crude oil.) Mr. Samuel Frazer, of the
                            Atlantic Refining Company, told me that he had been informed
                            confidentially that the Advisory Board designated by the Decree of
                            September 24 had already prepared its report and would recommend the
                            setting up of a National Oil Pool Committee to be composed of only three
                            members representing respectively the Ministry of Industries, the Ancap,
                            and the foreign companies which import crude oil (namely the two
                            American concerns mentioned above and Shell Mex Uruguay Ltda.).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Frazer said that he considered it important that each one of the
                            three companies concerned have its representative on the Committee. He
                            said that he realized that the Uruguayan Government would be loath to
                            designate a Committee a majority of whose members would be
                            representatives of foreign concerns. He expressed, however, the opinion
                            that the companies would be in a better position to protect their
                            interests if the Committee had seven members—four representing the
                            Government and three representing the companies.</p>
                        <p>When I saw Dr. Guani last evening, I referred to the decree of September
                            24 and remarked that I presumed that the Advisory Board for which it
                            provided was not the National Oil Pool Committee contemplated in the
                            Department’s statement. (Mr. Frazer had asked me not to intimate to Dr.
                            Guani that I had received any advices regarding the prospective
                            recommendations of the Board, since the information had been furnished
                            him confidentially.) With reference to the National Oil Pool Committee
                            contemplated by the Department, I took occasion to refresh Dr. Guani’s
                            memory and quoted the pertinent portion of the Department’s statement
                            regarding representation on behalf of “each of the principal oil
                            supplying organizations”. The Minister said very frankly that the
                            Government could hardly set up a committee <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179"
                                facs="0189"/>on which the private companies would be in the
                            majority. To this I replied that, as far as I was aware, there would be
                            no objection to the Government’s appointing as many official
                            representatives as it desired, and that by appointing three officials
                            and a representative of Ancap, the Government could provide for
                            representation of the three companies and still have a majority. Again
                            very frankly, Dr. Guani said that in his opinion the representative of
                            the Ancap could hardly be considered as representing the Government in
                            view of the very independent attitude frequently assumed by that body.
                            He expressed also the personal opinion that the Committee should not be
                            large and unwieldy. He promised, however, to give due consideration to
                            my observations.</p>

                        <p>480. Department’s circular of August 30, 5 p.m. In recent meetings I have
                            suggested to the Foreign Minister the advisability of early Chilean
                            action in the matter of the oil pool. Yesterday afternoon Rossetti<note
                                n="10" xml:id="d202fn1">Juan B. Rossetti, Chilean Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> informed me that he had sent detailed
                            instructions to the Chilean Embassy at Washington regarding Chile’s
                            point of view on the proposal. He was somewhat vague as to the details
                            of the Chilean proposal but his argument seemed to be that Chile would
                            be willing, if necessary, to impose a cut on the nitrate and copper
                            companies but that since these industries were of prime importance to
                            our defense effort, we would have to see that the cuts were restored. In
                            short, Chile would suffer little or no reduction in oil supply.</p>
                        <p>In regard to my question as to the delay in setting up a national oil
                            pool committee, he said that a petroleum committee had already been
                            formed by the Chilean Government. (<hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: The
                            Chilean Government did set up two petroleum committees by a decree of
                            August 30 but neither of these conform to our proposal as petroleum
                            suppliers are not represented therein.)</p>
                        <p>Rossetti was not inclined to discuss the matter thoroughly nor did I
                            insist as I feel that the best procedure would be for the Department to
                            give a very categorical exposé of the situation to Michels,<note n="11"

                            first two have officially replied.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the Brazilian Government study the proposal

                            should formally participate in the National Oil Pool Committee, rather
                            than merely indicate that it is satisfied with the present informal
                            arrangement.</p>

                        <p>Two or three months ago the American republics were faced with a shortage
                            in tank ships that made a severe reduction in oil supplies to the
                            Atlantic Coast of the United States and to the other American republics
                            seem imminent. In this situation my Government established a program for
                            the efficient utilization of all United States facilities for the
                            delivery of petroleum and, in a statement which was presented to this
                            Committee on September 4, invited the cooperation of the other American
                            republics. Prompt action in coordinating the petroleum delivery
                            facilities of the United States, in accordance with the principles set
                            forth in this plan, resulted in immediate and substantial economies in
                            transportation. Regardless of ownership of either tank ships or oil,
                            supplies began to be moved into each country from the nearest source.
                            Partial discharge of one ship at several ports was eliminated where
                            practicable, thus minimizing the movement of tankers with only one-half
                            or one-third of a cargo. Lost time has been reduced in various other
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>Many of the other American governments indicated their desire to
                            cooperate in the program suggested by my Government, and their petroleum
                            distribution facilities were coordinated with those of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this inter-American collaboration, the rapid depletion of
                            reserve inventories has been checked, and, while the full possibilities
                            of this joint effort have not yet been secured, I can say that the tank
                            ships presently available are now used with such efficiency that the
                            current requirements of each country in this hemisphere can be met one
                            hundred percent, and very soon reserve inventories will begin to build
                            up at substantial rates.</p>
                        <p>This reversal in situation, from threatened depletion of reserve stocks
                            and rationed consumption to full supply and gradual replenishment of
                            inventories, has resulted from hemispheric cooperation. Credit goes
                            equally to all who have taken part.</p>
                        <p>I can say further that we expect that within the next two months the tank
                            ship tonnage supplying the American republics will substantially be
                            increased. With this increase and the additional gains <pb n="183"
                                xml:id="pg_183" facs="0193"/>in efficiency that should be possible
                            with complete collaboration, it is expected that a high degree of
                            security with respect to oil supplies will be assured to this
                            hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The maintenance and extension of the cooperative system of petroleum
                            delivery is essential in the attainment of these objectives.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s circular telegram of August 30, 5 p.m., suggesting the
                            formation of a Petroleum Committee in Paraguay to cooperate with the
                            Petroleum Supply Committee in the United States.</p>
                        <p>A copy and translation of most of the text of the Department’s
                            telegraphic instruction were formally transmitted to the Foreign Office
                            under date of September 6, 1941, after previous informal conversations
                            with the Foreign Minister; and were referred by the Foreign Office to
                            the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industries, Dr. Francisco
                            Esculies. On various occasions I have recalled the matter orally to the
                            Foreign Minister, and he in turn has recalled it to Dr. Esculies. I have
                            also twice mentioned it personally to the latter.</p>
                        <p>There is now at hand a formal reply from the Foreign Office, dated
                            December 15, 1941, incorporating a communication which it received <pb
                                n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0194"/>from Dr. Esculies under date of
                            December 10, 1941. A copy and translation are enclosed herewith.<note
                                n="16" xml:id="d210fn1">Not printed.</note> The Department will note
                            that the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industries feels that
                            since Paraguay’s supplies of petroleum products are received wholly
                            through Argentina, the handling of petroleum matters here might be left
                            to the National Carburant Section of his Ministry without the formation
                            of the Committee suggested in the telegraphic instruction above cited.
                            If the organization of the committee is necessary he suggests that it be
                            composed of two representatives of the Paraguayan Government and one
                            representative of the petroleum importers.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I anticipate that the recent declarations of war will gradually lead Dr.
                            Esculies into a more cooperative attitude, if political developments
                            here do not result in his retirement; but feel that no present attempt
                            should be made to force his hand. It is my understanding that Paraguay’s
                            petroleum supplies are in fact wholly controlled from Buenos Aires so
                            that the formation of a country committee in Paraguay might very well be
                            entirely foregone.</p>

                        <p>As you are aware, a number of German and Italian vessels have for many
                            months sought refuge in the ports of the United States and have enjoyed
                            the hospitality and protection of this Government. On Saturday, March
                            29, the U. S. Coast Guard received reliable information to the effect
                            that the crews of these vessels had received orders to sabotage and
                            disable the ships. In an effort to prevent such action, the Coast Guard
                            immediately placed guards on the vessels. These guards found that in
                            many cases extensive sabotage had already taken place. It was therefore
                            decided to assume protective control over the vessels and to place their
                            crews under custody in order to avoid further damage to the ships as
                            well as possible injury to the ports and harbors of the United
                                States.<note n="1" xml:id="d211fn1">For correspondence regarding the

                        <p>The urgency of the matter was so great that the Coast Guard authorities

                            the opinion expressed by the Government of Uruguay as to the
                            desirability of an inter-American exchange of views with regard to the
                            problem created by the presence of immobilized merchant ships in the
                            ports of the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>This Government inclines to the view that the most expeditious and the
                            most satisfactory means afforded in order that the desired exchange of
                            views may take place promptly would be the Inter-American Financial and
                            Economic Advisory Committee of Washington. It would seem highly
                            desirable that this Committee be utilized in order to exchange views
                            between all of the American Governments in this regard, and, since the
                            Committee is in continuous session, the matter could be taken up
                            immediately. Such discussion, it is hoped, might lead to an identity of
                            views as to the course to be followed by each individual American
                            Republic. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay knows, it is
                            the desire of the Chief Executive of the United States that he be
                            accorded powers by the Congress to requisition foreign flag merchant
                            ships now in American ports. It is anticipated that this question will
                            be taken up by the Congress as soon as it reconvenes after its present
                            brief holiday.</p>
                        <p>The present consideration by the Inter-American Financial and Economic
                            Advisory Committee of the problem will, of course, in no way prevent any
                            future consultative meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the American
                            Republics from giving further consideration to the question.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, the United States Government will be glad to support any
                            initiative which the Government of Uruguay might take in recommending to
                            the other American Republics that the problem of immobilized merchant
                            shipping in American ports be brought up for immediate discussion before
                            the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee with the
                            understanding, of course, that the Committee itself in accordance with
                            its functions will not be empowered to reach any decisions but will
                            merely formulate recommendations to the respective American
                            Governments.</p>

                                            to maintain trade intercourse among them, the committee
                                            consider whether merchant vessels stationed, as a result
                                            of the war, in the American ports, might be utilized by
                                            the respective countries by virtue of a resolution which
                                            might be considered to have a continental scope.</p>
                                        <p>The measure proposed is based on the fact that the
                                            increasing rate of destruction of the means of maritime
                                            transportation by the belligerents has created a very
                                            grave problem for the fundamental right of this
                                            continent to preserve the trade which is [essential ?]to
                                            its normal existence. This inquiry thus envisages a
                                            concordant decision in the sense of utilizing the said
                                            vessels for navigation between the ports of America for
                                            the protection of American commercial interchange. It
                                            would be understood, at the same time, that the payments
                                            of rentals, compensations or any other indemnifications,
                                            would be a matter for agreement by the interested
                                            countries upon the termination of war, if this is
                                            considered most convenient or advisable.</p>

                            explained to the various American Chiefs of <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188"

                            Danish ships under custody and the request for a continental decision by
                            the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee, and
                            presumably appealed for support of Uruguay’s action by the various
                            American Governments.</p>
                        <p>In my interview, which concluded the proceedings, Guani appeared to be in
                            particularly good spirits. He stated that he felt everything was going
                            well and that he had an additional question to submit to the Washington
                            committee through his representative, namely to attempt to obtain an
                            inter-American declaration intimating disapproval if not actually
                            condemning diplomatic intervention in cases involving merchant ships
                            which he felt were in international law no different from individuals
                            who had not only come within jurisdiction of the country in which they
                            might be but who had actually used that country as asylum. He asked what
                            I thought of this reasoning and when I remarked that it appeared to be
                            merely an extension of the Calvo Doctrine<note n="7" xml:id="d214fn2"
                                >See Green Haywood Hackworth, <hi rend="italic">Digest of
                                    International Law</hi>, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, pp.
                                635 ff.</note> and that I doubted whether the committee, being a
                            technical, economic one, could properly rule on such a matter, he agreed
                            and said that while he hoped for an intimation of opinion perhaps all
                            that could be obtained would be a reference of the question to the
                            appropriate inter-American body for definite decision.</p>
                        <p>Guani then went on to develop other ideas not immediately relevant which
                            will be reported by air mail despatch.</p>

                        <p>I saw this afternoon the Argentine, Colombian, Brazilian, and Mexican
                            Ambassadors, and the Counselor of the Chilean Embassy in the absence of
                            the Ambassador.</p>
                        <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>I gave them copies of the draft resolution which this Government intends
                            to offer at the next extraordinary meeting of the inter-American
                            Economic and Financial Advisory Committee, and advised them that the
                            full text was being communicated to all of the American Governments in
                            order that this Government might receive the views and suggestions of
                            the other Governments of this Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>I impressed upon them all my belief that in the interest of continental
                            solidarity it was most desirable that this very important problem be
                            settled by unanimous agreement at the earliest possible moment and said
                            that I trusted this could be achieved before the meeting on April 22. I
                            said that if the matter dragged on in open discussions of a
                            controversial character, Axis propagandists would of course avail
                            themselves with glee of such an opportunity, and I felt sure the result
                            would be highly detrimental to every one of the American countries. I
                            said I believed that the draft offered for their consideration
                            harmonized with the various conflicting viewpoints and I earnestly hoped
                            it would receive the approval of their Governments.</p>
                        <p>All of the Ambassadors expressed their own personal approval of the
                            draft, but the Argentine and Brazilian Ambassadors said they felt the
                            real difficulty from the standpoint of their Governments was to find out
                            whether the British Government would withdraw its present objection to
                            the utilization by their countries of these ships.</p>
                        <p>I said that obviously it was the purpose of this Government to use the
                            ships in its own ports in such a way as to promote the interests of
                            inter-American trade and the interest of assistance to Great Britain, to
                            which, of course, we were completely committed. I said that under these
                            conditions it seemed to me probable that the British Government would
                            adopt a reasonable and friendly attitude in the matter and that it
                            seemed to me more than likely that the British Government would
                            negotiate a satisfactory agreement on this point with each of the
                            Governments concerned. I said that this Government, of course, would
                            make every endeavor to have a satisfactory solution of this point
                            reached.</p>

                                    many of which are not available for such trade because of the
                                    increasing rate of destruction of the means of maritime

                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that this resolution adequately meets
                            the needs of the situation described in Guani’s telegram to the
                            Committee. Please discuss the situation with him and let us have his
                            comments. It is hoped that he will instruct the Uruguayan representative
                            to support this resolution.</p>
                        <p>Please, at the same time, inform Guani that, if and when the President of
                            the United States is granted the authority which he has requested from
                            Congress to purchase, requisition or take over foreign ships in American
                            ports, it is proposed to dispose of those ships in such a way as will
                            advance both the participation of the United States in the carrying of
                            inter-American trade and the cause of Great Britain, to which the United
                            States has pledged fullest support and which the United States believes
                            to be vital to the peace and security of the entire continent. It is
                            hoped that, if and when the Uruguayan Government assumes control of the
                            ships in question in its ports, it will consider favorably conferring
                            with the United States and with the Governments of other interested

                        <p>As you are aware, recent developments have focused the attention of the
                            American republics upon the shipping belonging to Germany and Italy, as
                            well as to other nations, which, on account of war conditions, has been
                            withdrawn from normal commercial activities and is located in the ports
                            of the American republics. The following is <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"

                            Economic Advisory Committee at its meeting on April 16:</p>

                            April 12, 10 a.m., printed on <ref target="#pg_186">page 186</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the members of the Committee would submit the matter
                            to their governments and endeavor to receive appropriate instructions
                            for action at the next meeting of the Committee, scheduled for April
                            22.</p>
                        <p>The Department has given very careful consideration to this matter and
                            plans through its representative on the Committee to present a
                            resolution at the April 22 meeting of which the following is the
                            preliminary text:</p>

                        <p>Please make this text available to the foreign minister of the government
                            to which you are accredited, with the statement that in the Department’s
                            opinion it meets the needs of the situation and express the hope that a
                            resolution along these lines will receive the support of that

                            earnest hope of this Government that unanimity of opinion may be had on
                            the part of all the American Governments, and that full accord may be
                            reached prior to the next meeting of the Committee on April 22.</p>

                        <p>131. Reference Department’s circular telegrams of April 17, 7 p.m. and 8
                            p.m. I presented the preliminary text of the resolution to the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs<note n="10" xml:id="d219fn1">Alfredo Solf y
                                Muro.</note> this morning as well as the substance of the circular
                            telegram of April 17, 8 p.m. Doctor Solf immediately pointed out that
                            though the text of the resolution is in line with the note of the
                            Uruguayan Government the manner in which we propose to use the vessels
                            is different in that in addition to aiding inter-American trade we
                            advance the cause of Great Britain. He added that Peru would support the
                            resolution in so far as the use of the vessels in inter-American trade
                            was concerned which would be only course possible under the Peruvian
                            neutrality law. The Minister commented ruefully that the action
                            contemplated was rather late and that in any event Peru had a Danish
                            ship which it proposed to use solely for inter-American commerce.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that in view of the urgency of the matter he would
                            place it before the Cabinet which is meeting this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>159. Department’s telegram No. 62, April 17. Guani expressed particular
                            satisfaction with the last part of paragraph B of the <pb n="194"
                                xml:id="pg_194" facs="0204"/>resolution which he felt went far to
                            assert the juridical right of the American Unions [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Nations?</hi>] to deal with the immobilized merchant shipping and
                            which might render unnecessary any further declaration condemning
                            diplomatic intervention in such cases (see my telegram No. 156, April
                            14).</p>
                        <p>Guani said, however, that while as far as Uruguay was concerned he would
                            prefer to keep the present text unaltered throughout, he felt that our
                            Government might wish to consider changing the word should after the
                            word war and before the word now in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            substituting therefor the word could. By making the sense of this
                            declaration facultative rather than obligatory, Guani believes that
                            there is more likelihood of obtaining Argentine adherence to the
                            resolution. In his opinion the declaration under paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) is the most important and he added that there
                            were obvious advantages in having as nearly a unanimous adherence as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>That he was quite content to leave to our Government any decision as to
                            this suggested change and that in any event the United States could
                            count on complete support from the Uruguayan Government on the basis of
                            the preliminary text submitted which he felt was eminently satisfactory.
                            As I was leaving, Guani informed me that he was making a full
                            declaration as to Uruguay’s attitude toward immobilized shipping to the
                            press of the Americas this evening but that this official explanation
                            would contain no new points which he had not already communicated to me
                            and was intended primarily to serve as a means of informing the Americas
                            of his reply to the Italian Minister. Since it contained certain
                            personal references he could not make public the text of his note in
                            reply to the Italian Minister’s protest.</p>

                        <p>73. From the Under Secretary. Your 131, April 18, 5 p.m. I am sure you
                            will realize from reading the suggested preliminary text of the
                            resolution that there is nothing whatever in the text of the resolution
                            which would support Dr. Solf’s thesis that the resolution itself
                            indicates or determines the way in which the vessels would be used. I
                            think it would be desirable for you to make clear immediately that
                            insofar as the text of the resolution is concerned, it leaves to every
                            one of the American Governments full liberty of action as to the use of
                            the vessels and that, consequently, any government which, either for
                            reasons of policy or because of its domestic legislation, would desire
                            to use such ships as it might take over solely in inter-American trade
                            is at complete liberty to do so.</p>

                        <p>Please endeavor to clarify this important point as quickly as possible
                            and telegraph me the results of any further conversations you may have
                            in this regard. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>350. With reference to the Department’s circular telegram of April 17, 7
                            p.m. with regard to the question of German and Italian ships in American
                            ports, the following is a translation of the reply today received from
                            the Foreign Office to the Embassy’s note on this question: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s
                                    note the 18th instant in which, with reference to the proposal
                                    submitted by the Government of Uruguay to the Inter-American
                                    Financial and Economic Advisory Commission, regarding the
                                    utilization of ships sheltered in American ports, you transmit
                                    the proposed resolution which the Government of the United
                                    States intends to present on this subject at the meeting to be
                                    held by the Commission on the 22nd instant.</p>
                                <p>This Government naturally admits the situation created by the
                                    cessation of the activities of those ships and the problem which
                                    consequently faces the countries in whose ports they are
                                    stationed, regarding the resumption of the services of common
                                    interest which they normally assure.</p>
                                <p>However your Excellency is acquainted with the views of this
                                    Government in considering this problem, contemplating a direct
                                        <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0206"/>agreement with the
                                    owners of the ships and taking into account the respect due to
                                    the rights to which they are entitled. This position is also
                                    consistent with a particular situation which cannot but be
                                    pointed out to the Commission at Washington. Without entering
                                    into the consideration of the right of seizure which must be
                                    examined in one form or another by initiative of the Uruguayan
                                    Government, it is evident that such a serious and important
                                    measure depends for the moment on the effective benefit to be
                                    derived therefrom since the point at issue is not the
                                    theoretical discussion of a right but the practical and urgent
                                    solution required by present circumstances. This condition
                                    however will not be recognized—at least in so far as ships
                                    sheltered in Argentine ports are concerned—as long as there
                                    subsists the juridical divergence existing with the British
                                    Government and as long as the latter maintains, in detriment
                                    also to our neutral position, the attitude, which Your
                                    Excellency knows, of attributing to itself the right to dispose
                                    of part of the ships to be requisitioned.</p>
                                <p>The Argentine position regarding this problem is also particular
                                    and different owing to the fact that the German ships have
                                    already been transferred to the Argentine flag and that the
                                    Italian Government for its part has expressed its agreement for
                                    the sale of ships of that nationality. The right invoked in the
                                    resolution would therefore not apply to all cases and it should
                                    be asserted only in an optional manner in view of the

                                <p>In this situation, without denying its support of the principle
                                    of collaboration contemplated by the initiative in question or
                                    of the solutions which may seem fair and necessary in each case,
                                    on behalf of the lofty and solidary interests of the continent,
                                    the Argentine Government believes that the plan proposed should
                                    be completed and made clear in accordance with the spirit of the
                                    foregoing considerations.[”]</p>

                            general approval except from the Delegates of Argentina, Colombia and
                            Chile. Colombia and Argentina advanced suggestions directed at stressing
                            the freedom of action of each individual country. They also proposed
                            that points 1. and 2. in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the
                            resolution be inserted in the preamble. The Chilean Delegate was
                            instructed by his Government to endeavor to obtain assurances as to the
                            British attitude regarding the use of these ships before approving the
                            resolution. This point has been discussed with the Chilean Ambassador,
                            who is recommending to his Government that he be instructed to postpone
                            consideration of this point until after the resolution is out of the
                            way.</p>
                        <p>The resolution was submitted yesterday to a drafting subcommittee which
                            introduced a number of changes of presentation and phraseology and also
                            added certain helpful concepts of a nonfundamental nature. The revised
                            resolution, which had the unanimous approval of the drafting
                            subcommittee, including representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
                            Colombia, will be submitted to the full Committee on the morning of

                            their respective national legislations, in such a manner as to promote

                        <p>The United States representative, the Under Secretary of State, today
                            presented to the special subcommittee of the Inter-American Financial
                            and Economic Advisory Committee which is studying the question of the
                            vessels immobilized in ports of the other American republics the
                            following tentative plan: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <list>
                                    <item>“1) The basic principle of the plan is that the vessels
                                        now lying in American ports shall be utilized in accordance
                                        with the resolution of April 26, 1941 in such a manner as to
                                        promote the defense of the economies of the American
                                        republics as well as the peace and security of the
                                        continent.</item>
                                    <item>2) To this end there should be an immediate transfer of
                                        such vessels to active service. Just and adequate
                                        compensation for such vessels shall be made.</item>
                                    <item>3) In order to attain the maximum efficiency in the
                                        operation of available shipping, there must be the closest
                                        cooperation among the maritime authorities of the
                                        ship-operating nations of the Western Hemisphere in planning
                                        the most effective use of all available vessels. This
                                        cooperation must extend to the allocation of particular
                                        vessels to the several trade routes; to efficient scheduling
                                        where more than one shipping line serves an individual port
                                        or nation; to the diversion of at least minimum shipping
                                        facilities to those nations not reasonably adequately served
                                        and in which there lie no or not sufficient inactive vessels
                                        to alleviate at least partially the situation; and to the
                                        exchange or interchange among the ship-operating nations of
                                        vessels of various types in order that each may operate the
                                        type of vessels which it is in a position to handle and
                                        which are appropriate to the type of commerce to be
                                        borne.</item>
                                    <item>4) It is recognized that several of the American nations
                                        operate merchant marines and are in a position to handle
                                        efficiently the operation of some or all of the inactive
                                        vessels lying in their ports. Other American republics may
                                        not have the appropriate organization to operate ships or
                                        may not desire to undertake to do so. In such cases, the
                                        Government of the United States and United States shipping
                                        companies are prepared, in the closest cooperation and
                                        coordination with services provided by other ship-operating
                                        nations of the Western Hemisphere, to operate for their
                                        account or in any other appropriate way those vessels other
                                        American republics do not operate themselves. The Government
                                        of the United States is also prepared to make appropriate
                                        arrangements to take over and operate any such vessels in
                                        general services.</item>
                                    <item>5) The Government of the United States has been informed
                                        that the British Government agrees to recognize the
                                        transfers of vessels resulting from this plan of operation
                                        and to waive its belligerent rights so long as the following
                                        conditions are met: <list>

                                            <item>The vessels transferred are operated in accordance

                        <p>673. Reference to Department’s telegram no. 347, June 17, 10 p.m.,<note
                                n="15" xml:id="d227fn1">Not printed.</note> and strictly
                            confidential circular June 24, noon. In conversation with the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs this morning, I took the occasion again to emphasize
                            the difficult situation confronting inter-American shipping and the
                            responsibility of all countries concerned in cooperating towards a
                            solution of the problem. Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú stated that his Government
                            fully realized these difficulties and he was actively engaged in
                            cooperating with the Minister of Marine and the President of the
                            Commission for fostering an Argentine merchant marine in working out a
                            solution towards the acquisition of foreign shipping now in Argentine
                            ports. He added that steps were now under way to acquire by purchase
                            German, French, Italian and Danish vessels now in Argentine ports and
                            that he did not anticipate difficulties <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200"
                                facs="0210"/>in this respect. In so far as the four Danish vessels
                            were concerned, he said that steps toward their acquisition had been
                            facilitated through the Danish Minister in Berlin acting in
                            collaboration with the German authorities. As regards the Italian
                            vessels, negotiations were being conducted by the Argentine Ambassador
                            in Home and satisfactory progress was being made. Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú
                            stated that these vessels would be operated under the Argentine flag and
                            with Argentine crews and in agreement with the conditions specified by
                            the British Government (Department’s circular telegram of June 24 noon).
                            He authorized me to inform the Department that he hoped for a solution
                            of the matter shortly.</p>

                            placing inactive foreign registry vessels into service. The special

                            Please, in your discretion, discuss the matter informally with the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging prompt action on the plan in view of

                            may come through the placing into service of the inactive ships lying in

                        <p>442. Your 673, July 3, 6 p.m. Although the Department is gratified to
                            learn that steps are being taken towards placing into service the
                            foreign registry ships, it views with some apprehension the fact that
                            the Argentine Government’s efforts are being apparently directed solely
                            towards the acquisition of such ships by purchase. United States
                            interests have had a lengthy experience in negotiations with <pb n="201"
                                xml:id="pg_201" facs="0211"/>the owners of German, Italian and other
                            vessels in United States ports and these negotiations, which it is true
                            have been complicated by certain other issues, have resulted only in
                            months of delay with no definitive arrangements. As you know, the United
                            States Government is finally taking direct and unilateral steps towards
                            placing the vessels into service.<note n="18" xml:id="d229fn2">For
                                correspondence regarding the seizure and requisition of German and

                        <p>One great obstacle to the acquisition of such foreign registry vessels
                            will undoubtedly be found in the insistence of the British Government on
                            the blocking until the end of the war of transfer of any funds in
                            connection with the purchase or other placing into service of the

                                printed.</note> The Department, in conjunction with the Maritime
                            Commission, is finding it increasingly difficult to continue obtaining
                            shipping space for certain commodities, for example, oil and coal,
                            represented by the Brazilian Government as essential to the Brazilian
                            economy. Nevertheless, it is making every effort to see that Brazil
                            receives and continues to receive an equitable share of the available
                            shipping facilities. At the same time, the Department is disturbed by
                            the delay in placing the immobilized ships in Brazilian ports into
                            service. The negotiations, which are reported to be in progress for the
                            purchase of these ships, do not appear to have much chance of success
                            and the Department would greatly appreciate direct and immediate action
                            on the part of Brazil in making these ships available for its own trade,
                            thus aiding the Department in the more general task of providing all
                            possible shipping facilities for inter-American commerce. The resolution
                            of April 26, 1941 of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee and the plan subsequently evolved for the use of the
                            immobilized ships (see Department’s circular telegram of June 24, 1941)
                            give adequate and justifiable grounds for taking steps with respect to
                            these vessels.</p>
                        <p>It may further be pointed out that United States shipping authorities are
                            not likely to feel inclined to give sympathetic hearing to requests <pb
                                n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0212"/>for additional services or even
                            the maintenance of present services when perfectly serviceable vessels
                            are lying unused in the ports of the country making such a request. The
                            Department envisages the present shipping problem as one of vital
                            interest to all the American republics, and, as such, soluble
                            satisfactorily only by joint and cooperative action of the
                            republics.</p>

                                printed.</note> Progress is being made in obtaining the acceptance
                            of other American republics to the general plan for utilization of
                            immobilized ships referred to in the Department’s circular telegram of
                            June 24. The Cuban Government has accepted the plan without reservation.
                            The Government of Chile has accepted with one or two minor
                            clarifications and suggestions which do not in any way change the basic
                            plan. The Government of Argentina is also in general agreement with the
                            plan, indicating, however, that it will attempt to arrange the purchase
                            of the ships prior to taking any further action. The Government of
                            Venezuela has indicated that it proposes to requisition the several
                            Italian and German ships which were partially sabotaged and will attempt
                            to purchase the one German and one Italian ship in Venezuelan ports
                            which were not sabotaged.</p>
                        <p>Such arrangements for the purchase of these ships are of course within
                            the outlines of the broad plan presented by this Government to the
                            Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee. It is this
                            Government’s view that such attempts to purchase the ships are unlikely
                            to succeed in the near future, and this Government hopes that such
                            negotiations will not unduly delay placing the ships into service.</p>
                        <p>This Government is most anxious, nevertheless, that the broad plan be
                            accepted at once so that the various countries may go forward with
                            individual arrangements to place the ships into service. Moreover, we
                            are concerned lest the British fail to hold open their agreement to the
                            plan in view of the length of time which it is taking to have the plan
                            put into operation.</p>
                        <p>The Department hardly needs to remind you that the shipping situation,
                            both with respect to dry cargo vessels and to tankers, is <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0213"/>extremely tight and that there is no
                            outlook for improvement during the next 6 or 9 months. This is
                            especially serious in view of the fact that United States vessels are
                            being requested to carry increasingly heavier tonnages of cargoes to the
                            other American republics. This is especially true in the coal and
                            petroleum trades. It will be absolutely impossible for the United States
                            to provide during the foreseeable future even partially adequate
                            shipping facilities to transport all of the essential import
                            requirements of the other American republics southbound and strategic
                            and critical materials and other export staples northbound unless all of
                            the immobilized ships in other American ports are placed immediately
                            into service.</p>
                        <p>The Department is extremely anxious to have the reply of the Government
                            to which you are accredited not later than Thursday<note n="22"

                            Financial and Economic Advisory Committee today adopted in principle the
                            plan transmitted in the telegram under reference. It further resolved
                            that the plan should go into effect upon being agreed to by all of the
                            American republics, and that the Special Subcommittee on Immobilized
                            Ships should continue to work out details for placing the ships into
                            operation and to consider specific points raised by a few governments.
                            The Committee is transmitting by airmail to the Ministers of Foreign
                            Affairs of each of the other American republics a complete report of the
                            Special Subcommittee, including the plan and the comments received from
                            virtually all of the nations in whose ports there lie immobilized
                            vessels. The Committee is requesting the reply of the governments within
                            a 2 weeks period,<note n="24" xml:id="d232fn2">Later the period was
                                extended to 3 weeks.</note> in view of the extreme urgency of the

                                    plan for the effective use in the interests of inter-American
                                    commerce of the foreign flag merchant vessels lying inactive in
                                    the ports of the American continent. The text of the plan is as
                                    follows: (The plan is that contained in the Department’s
                                    circular telegram of June 24, 1941.)</p>
                                <p>“The Committee is continuing to study details incident to the
                                    actual placing of the vessels into service, and is especially
                                    considering proposals of the British Government for the
                                    implementation of Paragraph 5 of the plan.”</p>

                            a commission to be dependent from [<hi rend="italic">upon?</hi>] the
                            Advisory Committee to be composed of representatives of the maritime
                            authorities of those American republics which have taken over or are in
                            a position to take over ships immobilized in their ports. There will
                            also be represented on the commission a member of the Inter-American
                            Committee who will represent the interests of those nations having no
                            ships. The proposed commission is based on the principles and will carry
                            out the functions contained in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the August 28 plan
                            for the effective use of immobilized ships. There is no question of
                            abdication of sovereignty in the operation of the proposed commission.
                            It will, however, provide a useful channel for the solution of operating
                            difficulties which are occurring frequently. Decisions of the commission
                            will not be by vote but rather by full discussion.</p>
                        <p>Although the commission will eventually be composed of representatives of
                            eleven countries, it is obvious that no effective work can be done until
                            Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and of course the United States have appointed
                            their representatives. In the case of the United States a member of the
                            Maritime Commission will be the representative; his authority in
                            shipping matters is extremely broad and it is hoped that the other
                            countries will be able to appoint members with authority approaching
                            this level. The problem in Argentina is complicated by the fact that the
                            Government plans to operate the sixteen Italian ships, while the
                            Mihanovich Line controls other merchant vessels. Obviously it would be
                            to the advantage of all concerned to have someone appointed from
                            Argentina who will be able effectively to represent both of these
                            interests, and you are requested to urge the Argentine Government to
                            make such an appointment.</p>
                        <p>The work of the commission will consist primarily in advising on the
                            distribution among those represented of the available cargoes, both
                            northbound and southbound. In as much as some of these cargoes are less
                            desirable than others and some are more urgently needed, the commission
                            will have to decide on an operating level how these problems are to be
                            met. As you know, some discontent has already arisen as a result of the
                            fixing of two of the ex-Italian vessels for sugar from <pb n="206"
                                xml:id="pg_206" facs="0216"/>Peru to New York. This is a type of
                            problem which will be avoided by the establishment of the new
                            commission.</p>

                        <p>1038. Reference Department’s no. 968, November 22, 8 p.m. Governments of
                            14 of the American Republics have approved the recommendation of the
                            Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee for the
                            establishment of a dependent commission to consider maritime operating
                            problems. Among the nations with immobilized ships and important
                            merchant marines which have replied are the United States, Chile,
                            Mexico, and Uruguay, which have appointed maritime representatives, and
                            Venezuela which has accepted the resolution but which has not as yet
                            appointed a representative.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the most complete cooperation and coordination of
                            shipping services must be maintained if the shipping needs of
                            inter-American commerce are to be effectively met. Please urge the
                            Argentine Government to take prompt action in replying to the
                            recommendation of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee and to appoint as soon as possible an appropriate maritime
                            representative in the United States with whom such matters may be
                            effectively discussed.</p>

                            that they have expected me to bring some definite news regarding
                            progress in the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>From a statement made by the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs it is
                            clear that President Ubico hopes to receive Belize outright in
                            connection with the Lease Lend Bill.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn2"

                            other appropriate Guatemalan officials if only in order that they may

                            for some time past Guatemala has been receiving information to the
                            effect that Mexico is preparing to invade Belize in the event of
                            disturbances or the defeat of Great Britain and that on May 14th the
                            Mexican Ambassador had been to the Foreign Office to reserve the rights
                            of Mexico in Belize. The Foreign Minister quotes the President as saying
                            that if Mexico invades Belize Guatemala will resist with armed
                            force.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this morning.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to say again to Lord Halifax that I was profoundly
                            worried by the continued delay on the part of the British Government to
                            take any steps looking towards an adjustment of the boundary
                            difficulties between Guatemala and British Honduras. Lord Halifax said
                            that he would again take the matter up with his Government and urge that
                            prompt steps be taken in the sense desired.</p>

                        <p>69. My telegram No. 67, May 16, 3 p.m. The British Minister has just
                            informed me that the Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon asked if it
                            would not be possible to settle the Belize dispute immediately on the
                            basis of a boundary settlement, intimating that Guatemala would be
                            satisfied to receive territory up to the Sabun River and presumably
                            dropping the question of sovereignty. The British Minister informed him,
                            without agreeing to the extent of territorial concession, that he
                            believed such a settlement possible.</p>
                        <p>The Department may wish to consider the desirability of bringing to the
                            attention of the British Government this possibility of an early and
                            definitive solution. The offer of Guatemala is unquestionably motivated
                            by fear of the intentions of Mexico and I believe, whether or not
                            Guatemala’s fears are well founded, that the moment is now ripe for a
                            solution.</p>

                            conversation of yesterday in which I once more expressed the hope of
                            this Government <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0219"/>that some
                            appropriate and early way might be found by the Government of Great
                            Britain to further a friendly and equitable adjustment of the question
                            which has arisen involving the boundary between British Honduras and the
                            Republic of Guatemala, I am enclosing herewith a paraphrase of a

                            powers now at war with Great Britain, and unfriendly to the United
                            States, to conduct propaganda, not only in Guatemala but in Mexico as
                            well, which propaganda has already assumed considerable proportions and
                            may at any moment assume a dangerous aspect.</p>

                            replies, I proposed to ask Ambassador Winant to deal with the question
                            upon his return to London. The Ambassador said he thought this would be
                            extremely useful and would appreciate it if this action were taken.</p>

                            regarding the boundary between Guatemala and British Honduras and I am
                            sending you a copy by air mail pouch of a lengthy study of the case<note

                        <p>Mr. Eden made it plain that this question is rather a sore point with
                            them. They regard the principle involved as one of great importance and
                            not one which it would be in their real interest to solve <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0221"/>by what they would consider a
                            unilateral concession to Guatemala at a time when the Empire is under
                            pressure; they do not think that Guatemala has a legal case and there
                            exists an apprehension, which I am sure is genuine, that a concession
                            now to the Guatemalan point of view would be interpreted in more
                            quarters than one as a sign of weakness and likely to give rise to
                            similar demands in other parts of the world. I personally do not think
                            that this is a good moment for us to press for a solution. It would
                            arouse resentment and the feeling that we were taking advantage of the
                            war and the present world situation to attempt to force Great Britain to
                            grant a concession now on this longstanding controversy.</p>

                                at an early opportunity that the Ambassador of Ecuador, by
                                instruction of his Foreign Minister, has communicated to me the text
                                of the instruction which the former has just received under date of
                                December 28. The text of this communication is as follows:</p>
                            <p>[Text of Ecuadoran note not printed. It gave a detailed account of
                                recent incidents on the Ecuadoran-Peruvian frontier.]</p>
                            <p>In transmitting this message the Ambassador made the following
                                suggestions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In the event that Peru refuses to agree to the immediate
                                        beginning of the work of the Commission,<note n="4"
                                            xml:id="d247fn3">Peru had accepted a proposal by Ecuador

                                        Commission of Conciliation; and it is hoped that the
                                        Department of State will lend every assistance in order that
                                        the Commission may accomplish its high objective and in
                                        order to avoid, meanwhile, any resort to violence on the
                                        part of Peru. Anything that the Department of State might do
                                        to promote peace between the two countries would be
                                        profoundly appreciated; and in its desire to avoid a
                                        conflict the Ecuadoran Government would be prepared to
                                        accept any measure that might be proposed to it and that
                                        might have the guarantee of a friendly government.”</p>

                            <p>We have recently received decidedly disquieting reports on the
                                situation along the Peruvian-Ecuadoran frontier, and while both
                                Governments reiterate their desire to adopt only peaceful methods of
                                settlement and to refrain from any acts which might result in
                                violence, the dangers of the situation, particularly under present
                                world conditions, are obvious. It is by no means impossible that
                                agents of non-American <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0223"
                                />powers may have some responsibility for the present recrudescence
                                of the controversy.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me all the more desirable for these reasons that some
                                further attempt be made to persuade the two Governments of the
                                necessity, in the interest of the entire continent—apart from their
                                own best interests—to submit the solution of the boundary dispute to
                                some friendly mediation or to some impartial arbitration. As Aranha
                                knows, I have felt for a long time that the Government of Brazil is
                                the best qualified of all of the American governments to undertake
                                the task of mediation. I recognize, perhaps more than any one else,
                                the efforts which Aranha has already made in this sense. I would be
                                most grateful, however, if you would let me have his views with
                                regard to this communication, and let me know if he does not now see
                                the way for some further effort on his part which may pave the way
                                towards the desired solution. He may, of course, count, as he knows
                                without my telling him, upon the consistent and earnest support of
                                this Government in the efforts which he may find it possible to make
                                in this direction. [Welles.]</p>

                                which he said he hoped to put into effect within a very few weeks. I
                                stressed the importance of the time element and he agreed. He said
                                that his first effort would be to endeavor to tranquilize and
                                stabilize the border situation by creating an atmosphere of real
                                friendship and confidence. His idea is that this can be done by
                                means of treaties of friendship and commerce, exchange of students
                                and professors, et cetera. He proposes as a first step a meeting
                                between himself and the Ecuadoran Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                possibly aboard a ship off the coast of Ecuador or Peru to discuss
                                the whole matter in a friendly atmosphere and to develop the plan he
                                has in mind.</p>

                                which I quote below the pertinent excerpt: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“At this morning’s interview, I asked Dr. Tobar<note n="11"
                                            xml:id="d250fn2">Julio Tobar Donoso, Ecuadoran Minister

                                        would like to tell me about the latest developments in the
                                        boundary matter.</p>
                                    <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0225"/>
                                    <p>He explained in some detail that the Foreign Minister of Peru
                                        had suggested that the simplest solution might be through
                                        direct negotiations. Probably as a first step to reestablish
                                        confidence, the two Foreign Ministers might confer about a
                                        treaty of amity, probably including exchanges of professors
                                        and students. However, the Foreign Minister showed me a
                                        telegram received yesterday from Ecuador’s Minister at Lima
                                        indicating that the proposals had been withdrawn.</p>
                                    <p>Dr. Tobar thought it conceivable that if the Foreign
                                        Ministers of Peru and Ecuador could meet on neutral ground
                                        possibly at Washington, possibly aboard a neutral ship, that
                                        some progress might be made providing two or three
                                        representatives of impartial countries could be present. Dr.
                                        Tobar suggested that the arrival of the new Minister from
                                        Brazil might offer such an opportunity if an appropriate
                                        ship were available.</p>
                                    <p>Another way would be for both Foreign Ministers to visit
                                        Washington, in which event it might be better not to
                                        announce the object of the visit. Possibly the opening of
                                        the Field Museum might afford such an opportunity. That Peru
                                        and Ecuador could reach an agreement by direct negotiations
                                        without the presence of representatives from other
                                        countries, the Doctor thought highly improbable.”</p>

                            <p>56. From the Under Secretary. The Ambassador of Ecuador today gave me
                                a message from the Foreign Minister of Ecuador which confirms, but
                                in greater detail, the message transmitted to you in the
                                Department’s telegram number 49, February 4, 6 p.m. Dr. Tobar
                                expresses very definitely the view that a personal meeting between
                                him and the Peruvian Foreign Minister would be desirable, provided
                                it could be predicated upon the preparation prior to such meeting of
                                some general formula of solution prepared by some third friendly
                                power.</p>
                            <p>It seems desirable for you to bring this question again to the
                                attention of Dr. Aranha and inquire whether it does not seem to him
                                that the time has come when he might be able usefully to arrange for
                                the proposed meeting in some Brazilian city in the near future.</p>
                            <p>Please tell him further for his personal and confidential information
                                that I have received today a message from the Chilean Foreign
                                Minister, who has just been in Lima, expressing profound disquiet
                                with regard to the boundary controversy between Peru and Ecuador and

                            <p>Granted the apparently favorable attitude of both the Peruvian and
                                Ecuadoran Foreign Ministers with regard to a meeting between the two
                                of them, it would seem to me that the opportunity should be availed
                                of unless Dr. Aranha has reason to believe that further extensive
                                preparatory work is required.</p>

                            <p>The Ambassador stated that the Foreign Minister of Peru felt it would
                                be helpful to the United States to obtain the Peruvian point of view
                                with regard to the present status of the boundary dispute with
                                Ecuador. The Ambassador said— <list>

                                        upon Peru for a settlement and because of the publicity

                                        the military outposts now held by both Governments.</item>

                            <p>I replied to the Ambassador that I was appreciative of the friendly
                                spirit in which this message was conveyed by his Government to the
                                United States, but that I regretted to say that it seemed to me of a
                                very negative character.</p>
                            <p>I said that the Ambassador and I both knew that the Government of
                                Ecuador would never agree to fixing a temporary line between Peru
                                and Ecuador based upon present military posts of both countries
                                inasmuch as Ecuador would maintain that if this were done, Peru
                                would postpone indefinitely any final settlement and would maintain
                                for an indefinite period jurisdiction over territories claimed by
                                Ecuador.</p>
                            <p>I said that I wanted to make it very clear to the Peruvian Foreign
                                Minister, through the Ambassador, that this Government, while not
                                intervening in any official way in the controversy, had done its
                                utmost to counsel Ecuador to refrain from a public ventilation of
                                the dispute which would result in exacerbation of tempers on both
                                sides. I said that I likewise had counseled the Foreign Minister of
                                Ecuador to postpone demanding the creation of a commission to be set
                                up as a result of the Habana resolution<note n="13" xml:id="d252fn2"
                                    >Fourteenth resolution, The Peaceful Solution of Conflicts,
                                    passed at the Second Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of
                                    the American Republics, Habana, July 21–30, 1940; for text, see
                                    Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 24,
                                    1940, p. 136. For Peruvian reservation, see <hi rend="italic"
                                        >ibid.</hi>, p. 144.</note> since Peru had made an express
                                reservation to the resolution and would, I knew, not agree to submit
                                to the jurisdiction of the commission. But, I said, nevertheless
                                this Government believed that the controversy over the boundary
                                between Peru and Ecuador was the most serious element of danger
                                today in the entire Western Hemisphere inasmuch as foreign agents
                                could perhaps at a given moment stir up the controversy to such a
                                point as to provoke an incident which might result in actual
                                bloodshed. I said it seemed to us that it was in the highest degree
                                necessary for the sake of the peace of the continent that the
                                dispute be settled in an equitable manner by pacific means as soon
                                as possible.</p>
                            <p>I stated that I was glad to receive the message from the Foreign
                                Minister which emphasized the peaceful intention of Peru and I said
                                this message confirmed, of course, the opinion this government had
                                of the noble purposes and pacific policy of the Government of Peru.
                                I said further that I had not discussed for at least four years the
                                possibility of immediate arbitration of the dispute but that I had
                                the utmost faith in the efficacy of Dr. Aranha, the Brazilian
                                Foreign Minister, as an impartial friend of both sides who could
                                unquestionably, through the exercise of his good offices, bring
                                about a friendly, equitable and permanent settlement of the dispute.
                                I said I knew of no other man in the Hemisphere today who was as
                                well qualified <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0228"/>because of
                                his innate ability, as well as because of the position he occupied,
                                to render effectively this great service to the cause of peace in
                                the New World. I expressed my very fervent hope that the Government
                                of Peru and the Government of Ecuador would have resort to his
                                services.</p>

                                conversation on February 28 between the Under Secretary and the
                                Peruvian Ambassador in Washington regarding the Ecuador-Peru
                                boundary dispute, I have the honor to report upon a conversation
                                that I had yesterday with the Peruvian Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Solf y Muro informed me that there have been no recent
                                developments in the boundary situation and that happily all is quiet
                                in both countries. He said that this condition may be due in part to
                                the fact that a good proportion of the territory in dispute is
                                flooded at the present time so that any activity is almost
                                impossible.</p>
                            <p>He told me that he had submitted a proposal to the Ecuadoran Minister
                                of Foreign Affairs and that the new Ecuadoran Minister to Peru is
                                supposed to bring a reply when he comes to Lima. The proposal
                                embodied the following points: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) both
                                Governments should wipe out all that had been done during the year
                                1940 with respect to the boundary situation and should return to the
                                conditions which existed in 1939; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the
                                Mixed Commission might then discuss pending questions relating to
                                the boundary situation, and during these discussions work might go
                                forward looking toward a definitive solution; and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) Peru at the same time would be disposed to cooperate
                                with Ecuador on a program designed to improve relations between the
                                two countries and to create an atmosphere favorable to a peaceful
                                settlement of the boundary question.</p>
                            <p>… The Chief of Protocol informed us this morning that the Brazilian

                                manifest anew to the republics of the continent that it is disposed
                                now as before to solve in an equitable and business-like form its
                                controversy with Peru in a manner appropriate to peoples of the same
                                historical origins and ancestry bound together by the epic ties of
                                the emancipation in which they made their sacrifices for the
                                conquest of liberty and called into a close union by the
                                inter-dependence arising from their proximity itself, the
                                complementary character of their economies and other fortunate and
                                unavoidable circumstances. Our difference is the only one that still
                                casts a shadow on America, impeding the republics in delivering
                                themselves with absolute frankness and generous brotherhood to the
                                needs of the common defense and of mutual cooperation. My Government
                                consequently would not overlook any juridical method to attain that
                                solution which is called for by the peaceful policy of the vigorous
                                continent in this solemn moment in which only right can save the
                                world, burning in an orgy of hate and violence. As has been
                                repeatedly stated by Ecuador, it is ready to enter into direct
                                arrangements with Peru if it is given guarantees of good faith in
                                the negotiation, to take advantage of the eminently American
                                recourse of arbitration, or to accept finally the friendly
                                assistance of other governments which may desire to lend their
                                fruitful cooperation to terminate the dispute. We do not exclude any
                                recourse nor refuse any proposition compatible with the history and
                                the nature of this annoying dispute. I hope that your illustrious
                                Government will look with lively sympathy upon this attitude which
                                reveals once more the confidence engendered by the community spirit
                                of the American nations and their unanimous tendency in favor of
                                reciprocal concord. With this assurance I reiterate to Your
                                Excellency the expressions of my highest consideration.</p>

                            <p>53. I have received a telegram directly from the Ecuadoran Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs, prompted by the recent Colombian-Venezuelan
                                boundary agreement, expressing again the keen desire of the
                                Ecuadoran Government for a settlement of the boundary dispute with
                                Peru. This telegram appears to have been a circular to the foreign
                                ministers of all of the other American republics. Please deliver the
                                following acknowledgement for me to Dr. Tobar: <quote

                                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0231"/>telegram which you
                                    have sent to the Ministries for Foreign Affairs of the American
                                    Republics. I must express to Your Excellency the energetic
                                    protest of my Government for the declaration contained in the
                                    telegram to which reference is made that your Ministry requires
                                    that it be given guarantees of good faith in the negotiations in
                                    order to enter upon direct arrangements concerning our boundary
                                    question. The phraseology used by Your Excellency is
                                    inconsistent with the obligations of mutual respect between
                                    states. If the act of Colombia and Venezuela is encouraging for
                                    America, its merit consists in the constitution of a
                                    manifestation of the cordial relations of the two Ministries and
                                    the expression of the public spirit of the two peoples
                                    maintained during their litigation in an atmosphere propitious
                                    to a settlement and promising a favorable result. I regret that
                                    this Ministry, which, despite the continual manifestations
                                    against Peru produced in Ecuador has carefully undertaken to
                                    institute friendly negotiations in a peaceful atmosphere, has
                                    not received a response corresponding to its well intentioned
                                    objective.</p>
                                <p>In manifesting to Your Excellency that the Ecuadoran Government
                                    will find Peru always disposed to develop its relations with the
                                    serenity necessary to a peaceful relationship, I take advantage
                                    of this opportunity to reiterate the expressions of my highest
                                    consideration.</p>

                                    relations between Ecuador and Peru were becoming strained and
                                    that armed conflict over the boundary might develop. Following
                                    consultation between the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, and
                                    the United States, the offer of friendly services was made by
                                    the three Governments as set forth in this

                            <p>The Governments of Argentina, Brazil and the United States are deeply
                                concerned by the continuance, particularly at a time when
                                continental solidarity is vital, of the difficulties which for over
                                a century have perturbed the relations between Ecuador and Peru.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of the two countries involved have given many proofs
                                of their earnest desire to remove this cause of friction between
                                them. They have been in almost constant discussion and negotiation
                                over a period of many years in an effort to agree upon a common
                                boundary. However, in spite of the fact that some progress has <pb
                                    n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0232"/>been made and that the two
                                parties have agreed to submit the matter to arbitration, it must be
                                recognized that as of the present date the controversy contains
                                serious possibilities of dangerous developments.</p>
                            <p>Other continents are aflame with hate and violence. Every day the
                                theater of war extends to wider horizons.</p>
                            <p>Confronted with a crisis in world affairs of a magnitude heretofore
                                totally unknown, the American Republics have frequently declared,
                                and at the meeting of Foreign Ministers held at Habana in July 1940
                                reiterated, their irrevocable determination to omit no effort to
                                prevent any controversy which might impair their solidarity. The
                                continuance of any situation that results in the impairment of
                                harmonious relations between two of the American Republics
                                diminishes and undermines the strength of that solidarity.</p>
                            <p>Conscious of the desire of both the Government of Ecuador and the
                                Government of Peru to settle their long-standing boundary dispute,
                                as repeatedly evidence[d] by both countries, and impressed by the
                                necessity, in this critical hour, of the American Republics drawing
                                ever closer together in an unshakable determination to maintain
                                unimpaired their peace, territorial integrity, and security, the
                                Governments of Argentina, Brazil and the United States tender their
                                friendly services in furthering the prompt, equitable and final
                                settlement of the dispute to the Government of Ecuador and to the
                                Government of Peru to be availed of by those Governments, together
                                with the services of such other Governments as they are both
                                desirous of inviting, in such manner as may be deemed appropriate
                                and advantageous.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of Argentina, Brazil and the United States earnestly
                                and sincerely hope that the Governments of Ecuador and Peru,
                                appreciative of the high motives which have inspired this action,
                                will give the proposal their most attentive and urgent

                            <p>The Government of Peru has received the cablegram in which Your

                                Argentine Republic, Brazil and the United States of America offer
                                “their friendly services for the prompt, equitable and final
                                settlement of the boundary dispute pending between Ecuador and Peru,
                                in the hope of removing, under these grave circumstances, any
                                situation <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0234"/>which, by

                                may diminish or undermine the strength of continental solidarity”.
                                My Government, highly appreciating these proposals, recalls that it
                                is the second time that Argentina, Brazil and the United States of
                                America have taken this position. In 1910, a serious condition of
                                tension having been caused by the Ecuadoran rejection of the Spanish
                                arbitration, the three countries succeeded in removing the danger of
                                a conflict.<note n="19" xml:id="d259fn1">See <ref

                                asked for the withdrawal of the forces encamped on the frontiers and
                                proposed the final settlement of the dispute through the mediation,
                                which Ecuador rejected, affirming “that Ecuador is the only one who
                                has to decide whether or not the dispute with Peru affects her vital
                                interests, the national honor and the sovereignty of the State
                                itself”. According to the Ecuadoran Government direct arrangements
                                were the “most decorous means” and “most fitting for sister nations”
                                to put an end to the dispute, “with no other judge than the good
                                offices of our most illustrious and great friends.” While noting
                                these facts, which constitute the best proof that Peru is not
                                responsible for the prolongation of the dispute, my Government must
                                re-state, in the first place, the unwavering juridical position of
                                my country of respect for the popular will from which our
                                nationalities emerged, the basic principle in the argument
                                maintained by Peru in the arbitration proceedings at Madrid and
                                repeated in the Washington conferences. It is therefore an
                                unavoidable duty to declare that my Government cannot admit that, at
                                any time, the sovereign rights of Peru over the provinces of Tumbes,
                                Jaén and Mainas which, in 1821, swore the independence of Peru under
                                the aegis of General San Martín and which afterward participated in
                                the definitive establishment of the Peruvian State, and have been
                                represented in the congresses of Peru up to the present time, be
                                made a matter of argument. Peru is disposed to settle her boundary
                                dispute, but not to admit a controversy concerning the nationality
                                of provinces which have been a part of Peru for 120 years, and in
                                which are large Peruvian populations which have expressed their
                                energetic protest against the separatist claims of Ecuador. Peru’s
                                position is one of most fervent adherence to peace, but she demands,
                                also, respect for her international personality. To discuss the
                                nationality of three Peruvian provinces or merely to begin with an
                                assumed right to do so would imply the intention to disintegrate the
                                personality of Peru, formed by her constituent parts since her
                                independence, to revise the work of American independence and the
                                principles of obedience to the popular will in the formation of
                                nationalities <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0235"/>and to
                                introduce a grave confusion in the international order, which is
                                based on respect for the personality of States fixed by their sacred
                                initial constitution. The situation created by regrettable incidents
                                which lead the friendly Governments to fear “the possibility of
                                dangerous developments” will readily disappear, as has happened on
                                previous occasions, with the simple observance of Ecuador of the <hi

                                since independence. In consonance with the principles stated, which
                                Your Excellency will properly appreciate, the Government of Peru
                                accepts the good offices offered by the Governments of Argentina,
                                Brazil and the United States of America, to the end that the
                                atmosphere of cordiality and sincere collaboration between the two
                                countries may be restored.</p>

                                                offering to Ecuador and Peru its friendly offices
                                                solely by the most friendly desire to assist in
                                                settling, once and for all, the longstanding

                                                categorically and definitely that the United States
                                                has not, in any way, discussed with Ecuador the
                                                question of bases on the Galápagos Islands.
                                                Moreover, the willingness of this Government to
                                                consider making available to Ecuador two coastal
                                                patrol vessels and military supplies has absolutely
                                                no relation to the offer of friendly good offices
                                                but derives solely from a general policy of this

                                Ecuador and the Government of Peru have addressed messages to the
                                three Governments tendering their friendly services accepting the
                                offer. In its reply the Peruvian Government made several
                                far-reaching reservations, but in a strictly confidential message
                                addressed to this Government by the Government of Ecuador<note
                                    n="23" xml:id="d261fn3">Not found in Department files.</note>
                                the latter Government expresses the opinion that these Peruvian
                                reservations should not be regarded as an obstacle which would
                                prevent the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, and the United States
                                from proceeding in their efforts to further the settlement of the
                                boundary dispute.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of this Government the most expedient procedure for
                                the three Governments to adopt would be to regard the two messages
                                of acceptance from Peru and Ecuador as satisfactory since it is
                                feared that if any attempt is made by the three Governments to
                                obtain a more favorable reply from Peru, the latter will claim that
                                pressure is being exercised upon it which is not consonant with its
                                national sovereignty and dignity, and that consequently a situation
                                might result which would make it impossible for the three
                                Governments to interpose their good offices with a view to resolving
                                the dispute. It would seem probable that ways and means could later
                                be found to resolve the difficulties created by the Peruvian
                                reservations. I have given very careful consideration to the views
                                expressed by the Argentine Government in this regard, but I am glad
                                to say that, availing myself of the presence in Washington of the
                                new Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs,<note n="24"
                                    xml:id="d261fn4">Enrique Ruiz Guiñazú.</note> I found he fully
                                shares my views in this regard and that he has cabled his Government
                                accordingly. I have likewise consulted the Brazilian Ambassador who
                                is also in accord.</p>
                            <p>As a result of an exchange of views held today between Ruiz Guiñazú,
                                the Brazilian Ambassador, and myself, we suggest that the following
                                message be now sent without further delay by the three Governments
                                to the Governments of Ecuador and Peru.</p>

                            <p>The Ambassador of Brazil left with me the attached memorandum which
                                he had just received from Foreign Minister Aranha.</p>
                            <p>I asked the Ambassador to let Dr. Aranha know that I was heartily in
                                accord with his own views as expressed in this memorandum but that I
                                felt it was very important that some place be agreed upon where
                                representatives of the three friendly Governments as well as
                                representatives of Peru and Ecuador could meet in the near future so
                                as to give both Peru and Ecuador the assurance that something
                                practical was being done. Once this step had been taken, I said, the
                                soundings and confidential conversations back and forth could take
                                place in accordance with Dr. Aranha’s suggestions.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said he entirely agreed with my own point of view and
                                that he would inform Dr. Aranha accordingly.</p>

                                that neither of the Governments involved in the controversy should

                            <p>I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency’s courteous cablegram of
                                the 20th instant, in which you are good enough to inform me that the
                                Governments of Argentina, Brazil and the United States have received
                                with satisfaction the replies of Peru and Ecuador to the offer which
                                they made to the Governments of the latter countries in their
                                cablegram of the 8th instant. The good offices having been accepted
                                in my Government’s reply of the 12th [<hi rend="italic">13th</hi>]
                                instant “to the end that an atmosphere of cordiality and sincere
                                cooperation between the two countries may be reestablished”, Peru
                                will give due consideration to suggestions directed toward this end,
                                but it deems that joint conversations of the representatives of the
                                interested countries and of the friendly countries making the offer
                                are not in harmony with the institution of good offices, a form
                                which would be characteristic of a mediation, which Peru has not
                                accepted. The Government of Peru thinks that the immediate
                                discussion of the boundary difference would heighten the tension
                                between the two countries, producing, precisely, the contrary effect
                                to that which the friendly Governments propose to secure. The
                                supreme purpose which ought to be sought at this time is the
                                creation of an atmosphere of pacification and concord, basis of the
                                effective solidarity which is demanded by the period through which
                                America is passing and which would not be compatible with a hasty
                                solution of the problem. The insuperable obstacle which has hitherto
                                prevented reaching an agreement on the boundary dispute is the
                                insistent Ecuadoran attitude of controverting the nationality of the
                                provinces of Tumbes, Jaén and Maynas which form an integral part of
                                Peru of their own free will, reiterated throughout our life as a
                                Republic, consecrated by the principles which inspired the
                                emancipating revolution and which are recognized by universal public
                                law. In the face of this attitude Peru has taken the immutable
                                position fixed in my previous note, a position which would be taken
                                by any people conscious of its national unity. Peru, which has
                                respected the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> and which has
                                maintained absolute serenity in the face of the Ecuadoran agitation
                                of recent months, will continue the same line of conduct, accepting
                                the suggestion which Your Excellency makes at the close of the
                                cablegram to which I replied. Likewise Peru is disposed to subscribe
                                to a juridical instrument guaranteeing peace <pb n="231"
                                    xml:id="pg_231" facs="0241"/>between the two countries and
                                establishing a regime of effective cooperation until an opportunity
                                arises to obtain a settlement of the difference. Thus the noble
                                purpose will be satisfied which is expressed by the friendly
                                countries of removing any situation which, by injuring the
                                harmonious relations between two sister Republics, may diminish or
                                undermine the strength of continental solidarity.</p>

                            <p>167. The Governments of Argentina, Brazil, and the United States have
                                agreed to instruct their diplomatic representatives in Lima and in

                                agreement with them, request a joint interview with the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs. At this interview you will state the views that
                                follow hereafter as quoted from a memorandum agreed to by the three
                                Governments: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        hostilities was due to the other party to the dispute. On

                                            offer has now demonstrated the necessity of even more
                                            ample, common and solidary action on the part of all of
                                            the Americas for the purpose of terminating honorably an
                                            incident which threatens to spread ever more and to
                                            jeopardize the peace of these two peoples and of
                                            continental unity and safety.</item>
                                        <item>3. Animated by the same motives which determined their
                                            initial offer to Ecuador and to Peru and relying upon
                                            the sentiments of these two brother peoples, they
                                            suggest a joint effort on the part of all of the
                                            American countries with the object of reestablishing the
                                            harmony of our continent, and as a first step they have
                                            the honor to submit the terms which they have addressed
                                            to Ecuador and Peru, and which they hope will be
                                            supported by the Government of Your Excellency.”</item>

                                <p>[Serious fighting in the border regions broke out on July 23,
                                    1941. An agreement was reached for the cessation of fighting on
                                    July 31 but sporadic hostilities occurred later. Activities of
                                    the three mediating Governments, Argentina, Brazil, and the
                                    United States, centered on efforts to prevent further conflict
                                    and to secure the withdrawal of armed forces from territory into
                                    which they had advanced. Observers were sent by Argentina,
                                    Brazil, and the United States to the area of conflict.
                                    Correspondence on these aspects of the dispute not pertinent to
                                    the boundary settlement itself, is not here printed.]</p>

                            <p>386. Your 523, October 3, 9 a.m. The Department is delighted that a
                                demilitarized zone has been established and the lines of the
                                Peruvian and Ecuadoran armies defined through agreement between the
                                Peruvian and Ecuadoran military authorities. It is the Department’s
                                hope that this agreement will preclude the repetition of hostile <pb

                                opposing forces, and will thus contribute to the successful
                                continuation of efforts to restore peaceful conditions in the
                                frontier area.</p>
                            <p>The Department is confident that the agreement mentioned above in no

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to recent despatches and
                                telegrams, I have the honor to report further regarding possible
                                explorations looking toward a definite settlement of the boundary
                                dispute between Peru and Ecuador.</p>
                            <p>As I have reported, several Peruvian officials recently have
                                expressed to my Argentine and Brazilian colleagues and me the
                                earnest hope that the three friendly countries may be able to
                                propose a workable formula in the near future with respect to the
                                boundary conflict. There is increasing talk of the possibility of
                                reaching a definitive agreement upon the basis of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> line of 1936. Both the Argentine
                                and Brazilian Ambassadors appear to be confident that there are
                                chances for successful negotiations on this basis.</p>
                            <p>Since we are not informed regarding conversations which have taken
                                place at Washington, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, the
                                Department’s comment and instructions would be appreciated. A first
                                step might be for the three Ambassadors at Lima and the three
                                Ministers at Quito to undertake informal exploratory conversations
                                to ascertain if the Peruvian and Ecuadoran Governments would be
                                disposed to initiate direct negotiations for an agreement upon a
                                definitive boundary approximating the <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi> line of 1936. If this is to be done, it would be well
                                to impress upon both parties to the dispute the desirability of
                                presenting minimum rather than maximum claims for modifications in
                                the 1936 line.</p>
                            <p>There is enclosed a memorandum of a conversation<note n="34"
                                    xml:id="d271fn1">Not printed.</note> which took place yesterday
                                between Dr. Bellido, Secretary General of the Foreign Office, Dr.
                                Echecopar, Chief of the Boundaries Office of the Ministry for
                                Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Butler, First Secretary of the Embassy.
                                While it was understood that all of the views expressed during this
                                conversation were personal and unofficial, the opinions of Dr.
                                Bellido may be regarded as carrying substantial weight in matters
                                relating to the conduct of Peruvian foreign affairs.</p>

                                    printed.</note> and despatch no. 1979 of October 15. The
                                Department does not believe it would be advisable to interject any
                                new proposals into the mediation at this time. However it perceives
                                no objection to your conducting informal exploratory conversations
                                with regard to the possibility of a definitive settlement on the
                                approximate basis of the 1936 <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                line. It feels that these informal exploratory talks should be
                                confined for the time being to those you have in Lima and not be
                                extended to Quito.</p>
                            <p>As you were informed in the Department’s 408 of October 20, 2
                                    p.m.,<note n="36" xml:id="d272fn2">Not printed.</note> Benavides
                                is reported to have informed the Argentine Foreign Minister that the
                                Peruvian Government is devising a formula for settlement which will
                                soon be submitted to the representatives of the three mediatory
                                powers at Lima. Conceivably, in the light of the statements made by
                                Bellido to Butler on October 14, this formula may contemplate the
                                initiation of direct negotiations between the Peruvian and Ecuadoran
                                Governments for agreement on a definitive boundary approximating the

                            <p>578. After two interviews with the Peruvian Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs to discuss steps to carry forward the boundary dispute
                                negotiations, my Argentinian and Brazilian colleagues and I are
                                informing our Governments as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The Foreign Minister informed us that his Government desires
                                        to find a solution with our cooperation. Prisoners will be
                                        returned within a few days and there will be drafted a
                                        communication demonstrating good will, in order to create a
                                        favorable atmosphere. We further suggested that it might be
                                        possible to reduce the Peruvian forces in the north.</p>
                                    <p>As concerns the problem of the boundary, the Peruvian Foreign
                                        Office prefers to handle the question confidentially through
                                        diplomatic channels since it fears the failure of a
                                        conference or formal meeting where the two parties might
                                        adopt extreme and perhaps irreconcilable positions. My
                                        colleagues and I have reason to believe that we will be able
                                        to make progress along these lines.</p>

                            <p>579. My telegram No. 578, October 30, 11 a.m. The Peruvian Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs told my Argentine and Brazilian colleagues and
                                me that the 1936 <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line would serve
                                as a basis for exploratory conversations looking toward a definitive
                                settlement, although he said that there might be some difficulty
                                because Peru must insist upon retaining Andoas on the Postaza River
                                and Rocafuerte [on the?] Napo. He added that, of course, Peru would
                                extend free navigation facilities to Ecuador and we emphasized that
                                the latter country should have such facilities and that they should
                                be based upon navigation at the time of the low water mark.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that it should be possible to reach an agreement
                                within the next 3 months and added that if this were not done he did
                                not know when it could be accomplished. Thus Peru has reversed its
                                former position and now professes to desire an early and definitive
                                settlement. My colleagues and I are convinced that the Peruvian
                                Government does not wish to make a specific proposal but hopes that
                                the three friendly countries can assist in explorative conversations
                                that will bring the two parties together in an effort to reach
                                agreement through compromise on minimum rather than on maximum
                                claims.</p>
                            <p>The Peruvian attitude was confirmed in general by President Prado
                                during a conversation yesterday with the Brazilian Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>In order to further the present effort my colleagues and I agreed
                                that the Argentine Ambassador would approach the Ecuadoran Minister
                                in Lima discreetly and attempt to ascertain if the presence in Lima
                                of the Peruvian Minister to Ecuador may be in connection with direct
                                negotiations between Peru and Ecuador and if so, how our own efforts
                                may contribute to such a move. The Argentine Ambassador also might
                                be able to obtain from the Ecuadoran Minister some indication about
                                the minimum claims of Ecuador in order that we may compare these
                                with the Peruvian views about the 1936 line.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that during the next few weeks the efforts being made
                                in Lima would be greatly facilitated if the situation at Quito <pb
                                    n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0248"/>is handled with special
                                tact. Perhaps it would be wise for action at Quito to be directed
                                principally toward creating a favorable atmosphere; and it would be
                                most helpful if discussion of alleged minor incidents, of the
                                demilitarized zone and of the organization and activities of the
                                observers could be restricted to the minimum necessary to assure
                                compliance with the essential terms of the Talara Agreement.</p>

                            <p>584. My telegram No. 579, October 30, noon. The Argentine Ambassador
                                was told by the Ecuadoran Minister to Peru that the presence at Lima
                                of the Peruvian Minister to Ecuador is not related to direct
                                boundary negotiations since no such negotiations are in progress.
                                The Ecuadoran Minister expressed the opinion that the 1936 line
                                would be most satisfactory to Ecuador as a basis for discussions but
                                that if concessions were made to Peru at some points Ecuador would
                                want compensation without <hi rend="italic">putuma traduce</hi> [<hi
                                    rend="italic">sic</hi>]. He will report confidentially to his
                                Government regarding his conversation with the Argentine Ambassador
                                and inform the latter of any Ecuadoran views received in reply.</p>

                            <p>437. From the Under Secretary. Your 578, October 30, 11 a.m. The news
                                contained in your telegram is encouraging. I have spoken this
                                morning with the Ambassador of Ecuador urging that his Government
                                cooperate in the sense indicated in the last paragraph of your
                                telegram under acknowledgement as soon as some concrete opportunity
                                is afforded, such as the return of prisoners. He felt sure that his
                                Government would work along these lines. [Welles.]</p>

                            <p>My conversation with the President on November 9 gave an opportunity
                                to discuss the boundary dispute. My strictly confidential despatch
                                number 2155 of November 11<note n="38" xml:id="d278fn2">Not
                                    printed.</note> went forward in the air mail pouch from Lima on
                                November 12. In general, it appears that Peru would be satisfied
                                with the Zarumilla River–Chinchipe River line in the west, but does
                                not agree to take the 1936 <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line as
                                the basis of negotiations because of substantial modifications, that
                                Peru feels it must insist upon in the Oriente.</p>
                            <p>The President believes that the three friendly Governments should
                                ascertain Ecuadoran views in order to determine what the next step
                                can be. Subsequent to the negative information contained in my
                                despatch number 2104 November 5,<note n="38" xml:id="d278fn3">Not
                                    printed.</note> the question has been reopened with the
                                Ecuadoran Minister in Lima and he has promised to try to obtain
                                informally for us the views of his Government. Our difficulty here
                                is to persuade Peru to accept the 1936 line as the basis for
                                negotiations. My colleagues and I feel that it is only upon this
                                basis <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0250"/>that it will be
                                possible for us to work toward a settlement which will not be
                                affected by the occupation of territory resulting from recent
                                hostilities.</p>
                            <p>My Brazilian colleague has requested his Foreign Minister when the
                                latter returns from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro to talk with
                                Ambassador Benavides in Buenos Aires about the desirability and
                                importance of accepting the 1936 line as a basis for exploratory
                                conversations. My Argentine colleague is going to suggest to his
                                Foreign Minister that the latter take similar action.</p>

                                with the Argentine and Brazilian Ambassadors in Washington to inform
                                the Ecuadoran Ambassador in utmost confidence of the statements made
                                to you by President Prado concerning negotiations for a settlement.
                                We will request him to ascertain if his Government is willing to
                                negotiate on the basis of the 1936 <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>

                            <p>469. From the Under Secretary. Your 618, November 18, 1 p.m. The
                                Argentine and Brazilian Ambassadors and I conferred this afternoon
                                with the Ambassador of Ecuador.</p>
                            <p>We informed the Ambassador that as a temporary measure of convenience
                                it was believed that it would be helpful if we could utilize his
                                good offices in order to communicate secretly to the President and
                                Foreign Minister of Ecuador information received from the three
                                Ambassadors in Lima regarding the present disposition of the
                                Government of Peru with regard to the boundary dispute. We therefore
                                requested the Ambassador to transmit to the President of Ecuador the
                                following information. From authoritative sources in the Peruvian
                                Government it appeared that the Government of Peru desired to
                                negotiate a permanent and complete settlement of the boundary
                                controversy. It further appeared that the Government of Peru would
                                be satisfied to adopt as the basis of negotiations the line of the
                                Zarumilla River–Chinchipe River in the West. It would desire to
                                negotiate on the basis of substantial modifications of the 1936 <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> line in the East, these
                                substantial modifications involving the obtaining by Peru of Andoas
                                and Rocafuerte.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador at once inquired whether, in return for these
                                concessions sought by Peru in the eastern part of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> line, the Government of Peru would
                                be willing to make offsetting concessions. We replied to the
                                Ambassador that the three Ambassadors in Lima had no official
                                communication from the Government of Peru on this point but that he
                                might inform his Government for its confidential information that an
                                observation to this effect had been made to the Government of Peru
                                by one of the three Ambassadors.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then inquired whether the Government of Peru was
                                prepared to withdraw its troops back to the 1936 <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> line. He was told that this of course was one
                                of the points already insisted upon by the mediatory powers but that
                                the Government of Peru had not as yet given any final answer to the
                                request in question.</p>
                            <p>It was emphasized that the communication made to the Ambassador of
                                Ecuador today was in the nature of a secret sounding for the purpose
                                of ascertaining what the views of the Government of Ecuador might be
                                with regard to the possibilities mentioned.</p>
                            <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0252"/>
                            <p>The Ambassador stated that he would at once communicate secretly and
                                solely for the information of his President and Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs the communication conveyed to him. [Welles.]</p>

                            <p>1307. For the Under Secretary. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has
                                just informed me that as a result of a talk with Aranha this morning
                                they are in agreement as to the advisability of having Chile
                                included in the negotiations for a definitive settlement of the Peru
                                and Ecuador dispute. He had received from Espil yesterday a telegram
                                [apparent omission] your information that Peru has now agreed to
                                negotiations for a final settlement and both he and Aranha felt that
                                Chile’s interest in the Pacific justified its inclusion in the final
                                negotiations which would presumably be held in Buenos Aires. Aranha
                                felt that Chile would accept if invited.</p>
                            <p>If you are in agreement as to inclusion of Chile, Ruiz Guiñazú
                                suggested that matter be taken up with Peruvian and Ecuadoran
                                Governments through representatives of the mediatory Governments at
                                Lima and Quito. If both Governments agree invitation to Chile would
                                then be extended through the three Ambassadors at Santiago.</p>
                            <p>A telegram is being sent to Espil tonight asking him to take this
                                matter up with you. Telegram will also give Aranha and Ruiz Guiñazús
                                ideas of general lines Ecuadoran negotiations might follow with view
                                to final settlement.</p>

                            <p>627. For the Under Secretary. My telegram No. 610 November 14, 4 p.m.
                                The Brazilian Ambassador has informed the Argentine Ambassador and
                                me and is reporting to his Government regarding a conversation he
                                had with the President yesterday. The President repeated his
                                conviction that the three mediatory Governments can effectively aid
                                Peru and Ecuador to reach a rapid and definitive solution of the
                                boundary dispute. Prisoners will be liberated soon and a
                                conciliatory official communication will be published at the time
                                    <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0253"/>as a first step in
                                creating a favorable atmosphere for the continued efforts of the
                                friendly Governments. The President promised the Brazilian
                                Ambassador to initiate a press campaign by means of official
                                statements which would have a calming effect and which would prepare
                                public opinion for the acceptance of a possible solution upon a
                                realistic basis. Internal political factors prevent the Peruvian
                                Government from assuming responsibility for agreeing without
                                qualification to the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line of 1936
                                as a basis for negotiations in the Oriente.</p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Ambassador reports that after more than 2 hours of
                                conversation with the President he is convinced that if the three
                                friendly Governments can obtain the agreement of Ecuador to the
                                formula recently suggested to the Ecuadoran Ambassador at Washington
                                by the representatives of the three friendly countries a decisive
                                step will have been taken toward a rapid and definitive solution of
                                the boundary dispute.</p>
                            <p>I asked the Brazilian Ambassador if he had mentioned to the President
                                the matter of territorial compensation to Ecuador in the Oriente.
                                The Ambassador replied that the President had evaded his question on
                                this subject and had said that Peru does not like to use the word
                                “compensation”.</p>

                            <p>489. From the Under Secretary. Upon receipt by your Argentine and
                                Brazilian colleagues of similar instructions, you are authorized to
                                join with them in informing the Peruvian Foreign Minister that the
                                three governments would be glad to see included jointly with them
                                the Government of Chile in the tender of good offices.</p>
                            <p>At the same time it should be made clear that the Government of
                                Ecuador has informed, through the Ambassador of Ecuador in
                                Washington, the governments of Argentina, Brazil and the United
                                States that in the event that Chile is added to the three
                                governments now undertaking good offices, the Government of Ecuador
                                desires that the Government of Mexico be likewise added to the
                                list.</p>
                            <p>For your personal information you are informed that this Government
                                had no prior knowledge of the renewed initiative with regard to the
                                inclusion of Chile until it was informed that Foreign Minister
                                Aranha in the course of his visit to Santiago had agreed with the
                                Chilean Foreign Minister with regard thereto and had thereafter
                                agreed with the Foreign Minister of Argentina as to the desirability
                                of this step. You undoubtedly have seen press statements of public
                                declarations made by the Argentine and Brazilian Foreign Ministers
                                expressing their desire that Chile be added to the list of mediatory
                                powers. As soon as it was informed of this step, this Government
                                stated to Argentina and Brazil that while it had consistently taken
                                the position that it would welcome the participation of Chile in the
                                negotiations as it would welcome the participation of any other
                                American republic, it nevertheless believed that the final
                                determination of this question must rest with the Governments of
                                Peru and of Ecuador.</p>

                            <p>486. The Argentine Chargé d’Affaires has received a telegram from his
                                Government instructing to propose to the Ecuadoran Government,
                                acting jointly with me and the Brazilian Minister, the inclusion of
                                Chile in the mediatory group. His instructions state that he should
                                oppose the inclusion of any other country such as Colombia or Mexico
                                if that should be suggested.</p>
                            <p>My Argentine colleague is urging me to join with him in this action
                                on the basis of his instructions. I have informed him that I cannot
                                comply with his request in the absence of specific instructions from
                                Washington.</p>

                            <p>368. Your 486, December 2, 10 p.m. You are authorized, when your
                                Argentine and Brazilian colleagues have received similar
                                instructions, to join with them in stating to the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs that the Government of the United States would view
                                with pleasure the inclusion of the Government of Chile among the
                                powers whose tender of good offices has already been accepted by the
                                Governments of Ecuador and Peru. You should make it clear that the
                                Government of the United States for some time past has publicly
                                announced that it would be glad to have joined with the Argentine,
                                Brazilian and United States Governments the Governments of any or
                                all of the other American Republics but that it believes that the
                                question as to what powers should be associated in this tender of
                                good offices is a matter to be determined primarily by Ecuador and
                                Peru, the parties involved in the existing controversy. The
                                Government of Ecuador has already made it known to this Government
                                and to the Governments of Argentina and Brazil, through the
                                Ambassador of Ecuador in Washington, that, should Chile be included
                                among the list of mediatory powers, Ecuador would insist upon the
                                additional inclusion of Mexico. In view of this prior expression of
                                the official desires of the Government of Ecuador, it is difficult
                                for this Government to understand the position taken by the
                                Argentine Government in its instructions to the Argentine Minister
                                in Quito as reported by you.</p>

                            <p>Instructions similar to these now being sent to you have been sent to

                            <p>In order to avoid any confusion or misapprehension on the part of the

                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this Government has already
                                made its views known as above set forth with regard to the proposed
                                inclusion of Chile to the Ambassador of Ecuador in Washington and
                                that the views of the Government of Ecuador as communicated to the
                                Ambassador of Ecuador at Washington have of course been immediately
                                made known to the Governments of Argentina and of Brazil, as well as
                                to this Government.</p>

                            <p>652. For the Under Secretary. Your telegram No. 489, November 29, 7
                                p.m., and telegram No. 486, December 2, 10 p.m., to the Department
                                from the Legation at Quito. My Argentine and Brazilian colleagues
                                and I had an interview yesterday afternoon with the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs and informed him that our three Governments would be
                                pleased to have the Government of Chile jointly included in the
                                conciliation procedure. … the Minister gave no indication regarding
                                what the reply of his Government would be. He observed that if Chile
                                were to be added to the group other countries such as Colombia and
                                Mexico also might wish to join, thus approaching something like a
                                general conference which has been consistently opposed by Peru. My
                                Argentine and Brazilian colleagues told the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs that they had been instructed to the effect that their
                                Governments would resist the addition to the group of any country
                                other than Chile. The Minister then asked me if I had received
                                similar instructions on this point. In view of the difference
                                between my instructions and those of my colleagues and in view of
                                the telegrams from the Legation at Quito, I replied that I would
                                have to consult my Government, although I assured the Minister that
                                my Government considers the matter one for the determination of the
                                Governments of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
                            <p>The Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated that he is ready
                                to consider any proposal that our three Governments may wish to
                                submit with a view to reaching a definitive settlement of the
                                boundary dispute. He expressed the opinion that the representatives
                                of the three countries at Lima and Quito could carry on informal
                                conversations <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0257"/>with him and
                                with the Ecuadoran Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to find a
                                formula which could serve as the basis for a direct agreement
                                between the two parties. In this connection, I assume that no reply
                                has been received from the Ecuadoran Ambassador at Washington
                                regarding the views of his Government about the suggestions recently
                                made concerning the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line of 1936.
                                It would be most helpful if this reply could be obtained from
                                Ecuador so that we might continue our conversations here. …</p>

                                his Government last Saturday to impress strongly upon his Peruvian

                                the basis of the 1936 line and the unfortunate circumstances of
                                having the boundary question raised at the Rio de Janeiro

                                that the 1936 line be accepted as the basis for a settlement. The
                                Ambassador requested the Foreign Minister to confirm that with the
                                President and then to call in the three Ambassadors for another
                                conference; and expressed the opinion that if Peru accepts the 1936

                                of commanders and that both sides reach hasty conclusions about

                                discussed this encouraging information with my Argentine and
                                Brazilian colleagues. I hope you will do everything possible to

                                formulated by the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs. The
                                acceptance of the 1936 line would be far more expedient from every

                            <p>697. For the Under Secretary. Your telegram No. 524, December 16, 7
                                p.m. It is apparent from our conversation last evening with the
                                Minister of Foreign Affairs that Peru is anxious to reach a
                                definitive settlement in the west and to have its troops withdrawn
                                from the province of El Oro before the Rio de Janeiro Conference.
                                There still is evasion regarding the basis for negotiations in the
                                Oriente, where Peru obviously is seeking to limit Ecuadoran maximum
                                claims to the 1936 line while reserving for itself the right to make
                                claims which take into account its advanced military outposts.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister will see the President today and will continue
                                conversations with my Argentine and Brazilian colleagues and me this
                                evening or tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>He indicated Peruvian approach is to reach a definite settlement in
                                    <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0259"/>the west, while leaving
                                open the question of a permanent frontier in the Oriente. If our
                                present conversations lead to some such plan do you perceive
                                objections to it?</p>

                                before the Rio de Janeiro meeting, the three mediatory powers should

                            <p>406. The Governments of Argentina, of Brazil and of the United States
                                are in accord that it is in the highest degree essential that the
                                means for a pacific solution of the Ecuador–Peru boundary dispute be
                                found if at all possible prior to the Consultative Meeting to be
                                held in Rio de Janeiro on January 15th. Under existing world
                                conditions, the gravity of which is daily increasing, the unity of
                                the American Republics is more than ever necessary and such unity
                                can necessarily not be assured so long as the present controversy
                                between Peru and Ecuador continues. The dangers of such continuation
                                are apparent to public opinion throughout the continent.</p>
                            <p>In their earnest desire to be of service in bringing about an
                                equitable and satisfactory basis for successful negotiations between
                                Ecuador and Peru which would lead to a friendly and permanent
                                settlement of the boundary controversy, the three Governments are
                                therefore jointly proposing simultaneously to the Governments of
                                Ecuador and of Peru that the two Governments accept as a basis for
                                the negotiation of a permanent and definitive boundary settlement
                                between them the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line of 1936.</p>
                            <p>The three Governments further propose that should the two Governments
                                accept the basis of negotiation thus advanced, the forces of Peru be
                                withdrawn back of the 1936 <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> line,
                                and that the negotiations for a final settlement take place as
                                originally proposed at Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>You are authorized to present this proposal jointly to the Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs in the company of your Argentine and Brazilian
                                colleagues as soon as they have received similar instructions.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department urgently as soon as the date and hour for
                                your reception by the Foreign Minister has been arranged in order
                                that the three mediatory Governments may at that time communicate to
                                the governments of all of the other American Republics the proposal
                                thus advanced to the Governments of Ecuador and Peru. It is desired
                                that you arrange by telegram with your colleagues in Lima so that
                                your reception by the Foreign Minister in each case may be on the
                                same day and the same hour.</p>

                            <p>712. For the Under Secretary. My telegram No. 710, December 23, 10
                                    a.m.<note n="44" xml:id="d296fn1">Not printed.</note> The
                                Brazilian Ambassador received instructions this morning to insist
                                upon Peruvian acceptance, prior to the Rio de Janeiro meeting, of
                                the 1936 line as the basis for a definitive settlement: the
                                withdrawal of troops from the province of El Oro; the agreement of
                                the Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss the boundary
                                question at Rio de Janeiro but outside the conference; and Peruvian
                                agreement to a meeting at Buenos Aires or some other place after the
                                Rio de Janeiro meeting in order to reach a final settlement with
                                Ecuador. I am also told that the Argentine Ambassador and I would
                                receive similar instructions but these have not yet reached us.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Ambassador, who leaves Lima tomorrow, reviewed the
                                whole situation with the President and Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                in order to be able to give the Argentine Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs the latest report. The President was unyielding in his
                                refusal to accept the 1936 line as the basis for negotiations in the
                                Oriente and insisted that Ecuador recognize that line in the Oriente
                                as its maximum aspirations while Peru would agree to its present
                                line of advanced posts as its maximum aspirations and the zone
                                between would be the subject of negotiations.</p>
                            <p>This is a discouraging development, although a definitive settlement
                                in the west along the 1936 line and the withdrawal of Peruvian
                                troops from El Oro appear entirely feasible with Ecuadoran
                                agreement. The report of the Peruvian Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro
                                that the opposition of the Peruvian Ambassador in Argentina to the
                                1936 line probably are responsible for the present situation. Peru
                                seems less concerned about the Rio de Janeiro meeting in connection
                                with the boundary dispute. It is possible but not probable that, as
                                the Brazilian Ambassador believes, Peru may intend to withdraw
                                troops from El Oro before the meeting. The Peruvian Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs is going to Buenos Aires and will travel from there
                                to Rio de Janeiro with the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs.
                                The Argentine Ambassador thinks that the Peruvian Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs may feel that he and Ambassador Benavides will be
                                able to obtain some advance commitment from Argentina favorable to
                                the Peruvian point of view. I think that Peru may feel that it will
                                have a good case if there is a definitive settlement and withdrawal
                                of troops in the west, since it can claim that advances in the
                                Oriente have <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0262"/>been made by
                                both parties and that Peruvian advances are into territory in
                                dispute and not into Ecuadoran territory.</p>
                            <p>Will it now be possible for the three mediatory Governments to
                                instruct their representatives at Lima and Quito to submit a
                                specific proposal for an early and definitive settlement? A proposal
                                for a complete settlement on the basis of the 1936 line most
                                probably would be rejected by Peru. The alternative would be
                                immediate and definitive settlement in the west along the 1936 line;
                                and agreement upon the basis of negotiations in the Oriente,
                                possibly defining the zone in litigation there as that included
                                between the 1936 line and the present line of Peruvian outposts.</p>

                                        speedy and satisfactory solution of the boundary
                                        controversy. The Government of Ecuador has officially
                                        accepted the inclusion of Chile among the American
                                        governments whose good offices have been accepted, but no
                                        official reply has as yet been received with regard thereto
                                        from the Government of Peru. You should further say that
                                        your Government earnestly hopes that the Government of Chile
                                        will in every appropriate way express its support of the
                                        suggestions above set forth.”</p>

                                Rican Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Echandi. Informal
                                conversations were also held with the Honduran and Nicaraguan
                                Ministers resident in San José. At the concluding session yesterday
                                afternoon it was resolved subject to the approval of the mediating
                                governments to adopt the plan which was discussed in the Department
                                for aerial surveys by the Commission itself for its own account and
                                for its confidential use. At the conference with Dr. Echandi he
                                expressed the conviction that it would be inadvisable to proceed
                                publicly at this time in the Honduras–Nicaragua controversy since
                                such action might complicate or interfere with the satisfactory
                                progress which he feels is being made towards settlement of the
                                Panama–Costa Rica boundary question.</p>
                            <p>In view of the Foreign Minister’s opinion which is shared by the
                                Honduran and Nicaraguan Ministers, the Commission agreed to
                                terminate for the present this public phase of the mediation and to
                                continue its work through regular diplomatic channels. Copy of the

                            <p>Dr. Caceres<note n="53" xml:id="d302fn1">Julian R. Cáceres, Honduran
                                    Minister in Washington.</note> called to see me on the afternoon
                                of March 19, 1941 and brought up the subject of the boundary dispute
                                between Honduras and Nicaragua. He referred to the recent meeting of
                                the Boundary Mediation Commission at San José and said he was
                                convinced that the Commission would meet with no success so long as
                                it continued to insist on a survey before reaching an agreement in
                                principle. He said he understood that the activities of the
                                Commission in San José had been limited to bringing correspondence
                                and organization up to date and an agreement that Dr. Corrigan would
                                be authorized to suggest to the Honduran Government that a
                                preliminary survey be made, possibly by the National Geographic
                                Society.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Caceres said that he was not authorized to make any formal
                                statement on behalf of his Government but that he was fully
                                convinced <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0266"/>the President of

                                    Andino.</note> would not consent to a survey until some
                                agreement had been reached with Nicaragua. He said that he believed
                                a plan whereby Nicaragua would recognize the award of the King of
                                Spain of 1906<note n="56" xml:id="d302fn3">Given at Madrid December

                                in exchange for concessions on the part of Honduras was the only
                                plan which offered any hope of success. He added that he did not
                                have a definite plan for concessions to be made but suggested as a
                                possibility changing the border line from Totecacinte in a straight
                                line to some point along the River Segovia more or less due east
                                from Totecacinte or possibly as far northeast as the junction
                                between Rio Segovia and Rio Bocay. He said that this idea was
                                advanced as a tentative solution and that concessions might be made
                                at some other point. He added that Honduras would be willing to
                                grant Nicaragua equal navigation rights on the Rio Segovia, the
                                northern bank being under Honduran sovereignty and the southern bank
                                belonging to Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Caceres repeated a number of times his strong conviction that his
                                Government would not accept a preliminary survey and he stated that
                                the President was particularly opposed to the idea of an aerial
                                survey.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Caceres added that speaking personally and unofficially he felt
                                the dispute had now reached a point where it was no longer possible
                                to settle it on a judicial or historical basis but that some
                                solution had to be found which would “save the faces” of the
                                President of Honduras and the President of Nicaragua.<note n="57"
                                    xml:id="d302fn4">Gen. Anastasio Somoza.</note> He said he
                                believed the formula proposed would accomplish this as Honduras
                                would win the point of having Nicaragua recognize the award of the
                                King of Spain and Nicaragua would have the satisfaction of receiving
                                territorial concessions in compensation for its agreement to the
                                award. He said that if the Department of State or the Mediation
                                Commission cared to present a proposal or a draft treaty along the
                                lines he mentioned, he would give it his wholehearted support. He
                                added that if an agreement could be reached by the Nicaraguan and
                                Honduran Governments accepting such a solution in principle, he was
                                convinced his Government would then make no objection to a survey by
                                the National Geographic Society or another organization chosen by
                                the Mediation Commission.</p>

                            <p>151. The Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning read to me the
                                closing paragraphs of a long note dated June 13, 1941 and addressed
                                to him by the Honduran Minister for Foreign Affairs,<note n="58"
                                    xml:id="d303fn1">Salvador Aguirre.</note> in which it is
                                intimated that the mission of the Mediation Commission in the
                                Honduras–Nicaragua boundary dispute has been a failure and
                                consequently the Commission should cease to [apparent omission] that
                                Honduras adheres only to the award of the King of Spain and intends
                                to take appropriate measures to defend its sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>He has requested me to ascertain whether or not the Government of the
                                United States and the Government of Venezuela have received similar
                                notes from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras,<note n="59"
                                    xml:id="d303fn2">Note No. 1728 of June 13, 1941, to the
                                    Department, not printed, but see the reply dated September 5,
                                        <ref target="#pg_261">p. 261</ref>.</note> and I should
                                appreciate the Department’s immediate telegraphic reply on that
                                point in order that I may inform Señor Echandi. In the event both
                                the United States and Venezuela have received similar notes, he
                                suggests that similar replies may be made by the three
                                Governments.</p>
                            <p>Señor Echandi expressed grave concern over any steps which Honduras
                                might take at this time to take from the hands of the Commission a
                                matter which might result in armed conflict between Honduras and
                                Nicaragua. He has sounded out the Honduran and Nicaraguan Ministers
                                in San José and believes they have no information concerning the
                                decision taken by Honduras and he is especially anxious that
                                Nicaragua not learn of the note sent to him.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister proposes to transcribe the note to the Costa
                                Rican member of the Mediation Commission, Tobías Zuñiga Montúfar, in
                                order that he may in turn bring it to the attention of the American
                                and Venezuelan members of the Commission. He states he will also
                                transcribe a copy thereof to the Costa Rican Minister at Washington
                                in order that he may show it to the Department.</p>
                            <p>Minister Echandi feels that totalitarian influence may have induced
                                the Government of Honduras to take the unfortunate steps referred
                                to.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister suggests that perhaps the Department may wish
                                the American Minister in Tegucigalpa<note n="60" xml:id="d303fn3"
                                    >John D. Erwin.</note> to suggest to the Honduran Government
                                that it desist from taking the matter out of the hands of the
                                Commission at this time; that if the Government of Honduras promises
                                to decide to take no steps to take the matter out of the hands of
                                the Commission, it could obtain the assurance that no suggestions
                                for a settlement will be made by the Commission until <pb n="258"
                                    xml:id="pg_258" facs="0268"/>after the war. The Foreign Minister
                                has even thought of proceeding to Tegucigalpa to make this
                                suggestion on the part of the Government of Costa Rica, but he fears
                                that his visit at this time would be too conspicuous. He has also
                                considered sending Don Luis Anderson, who is consulting attorney for
                                the Honduran Government in the matter, to Tegucigalpa on such a
                                mission, but he feels that Señor Anderson holds the same view as the
                                Government of Honduras with reference to the validity of the award
                                of the King of Spain.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister requests by telegraph any information which the
                                Department may have on this subject.<note n="61" xml:id="d303fn4"

                            <p>31. Telegram No. 151, June 20, 1 p.m., from the American Legation at
                                San José refers to a note of June 13 from the Honduran Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs to the Costa Rican Foreign Minister intimating that
                                the Mediation Commission in the Honduras–Nicaragua boundary dispute
                                has been a failure, that Honduras adheres only to the award of the
                                King of Spain, and intends to take appropriate measures to defend
                                its sovereignty. You are instructed to discuss this question with
                                the Foreign Minister and to say that while it is to be regretted
                                that the Boundary Commission has not as yet been able to facilitate
                                a definitive solution of the boundary question the Department
                                assumes that the Honduran note in question is intended solely to
                                reaffirm the position of Honduras with regard to the award of the
                                King of Spain and that no action is contemplated which would
                                endanger a continuation of the efforts to bring about an amicable
                                settlement.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your telegram No. 31 of
                                June 24, 8 p.m., I have the honor to report that I sought an
                                engagement with the Honduran <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0269"
                                />Foreign Minister early today to discuss this matter, with the
                                following results:</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister was informed that a copy of his note on this
                                subject, referred to in a telegram from the American Legation at San
                                José, had not reached the Department and I wished to discuss the
                                subject matter with him primarily to seek information. He stated
                                that doubtless a copy of the note in question would shortly be
                                delivered to the Department at Washington, since instructions to
                                that effect had been issued.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister produced a copy of the note and read to me the
                                essential parts. I discussed the subject in the sense of the
                                Department’s instruction under reference. The Foreign Minister
                                emphasized that his note merely seeks to reaffirm the position of
                                Honduras respecting the award of the King of Spain in the light of
                                the Mediation Commission’s findings to date and that it was not
                                intended any tone of belligerency should be read into the note.
                                There have been no recent border incidents to prompt him in
                                reasserting Honduras’ rights at this time. However, he had felt that
                                in view of the Mediation Commission’s statement that the “second
                                phase” of its investigation and deliberations had been completed,
                                without, as Honduras viewed it, appreciable results, that the
                                development of a third section would not be productive of good. He
                                mentioned what he regarded as a tendency of the Commission to go
                                beyond a reasonable scope in its deliberations; in this connection,
                                he mentioned the topographical studies and the proposal of the
                                Commission to make aerial maps, to which project Honduras had
                                withheld its assent. He appeared to feel that further meetings of
                                the Commission in the near future would not have a tendency to heal
                                the situation and that the time is not opportune to press for any
                                further settlement.</p>
                            <p>The difficulties under which the Mediation Commission have labored,
                                particularly with the restriction imposed at the outset by Honduras
                                that there should be no tampering with the award of the King of
                                Spain, are too well known to require review. Since the position of
                                the Government of Honduras, as outlined in the note of its Foreign
                                Minister, dated June 13, is merely to maintain the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi>, and the phrase concerning defense of its
                                sovereignty is merely rhetorical and carries no implication of any
                                belligerent steps, it would not appear that this Legation should
                                take any further action at this time, except as instructed by the
                                Department after full consideration of the Honduran note under
                                reference, in all its phases, when it has been received by the

                                received a telephone call from the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister<note

                                that Honduras has sent an identical note to the Governments of the
                                United States, Costa Rica and Venezuela, the substance of which was
                                that Honduras stood on its rights under the award of the King of
                                Spain and felt compelled to defend its rights. Minister DeBayle
                                recalled that following the Habana conference in July 1940<note

                                        pp. 180</ref> ff.</note> the Honduran Minister had stated at
                                a meeting of the Governing Board of the Pan-American Union that he
                                was instructed referring to a Habana resolution regarding the
                                peaceful settlement of boundary and other disputes and to state
                                formally that Honduras had no pending boundary questions. Dr.
                                DeBayle said he had objected, explaining that the Mediation
                                Commission had been created for the purpose of finding a solution of
                                the Honduras–Nicaragua dispute.</p>
                            <p>Dr. DeBayle said that some time ago Minister Caceres had told him
                                that possibly the only way to reach a solution of the difficulties
                                between Honduras and Nicaragua would be by direct negotiation. Dr.
                                DeBayle asked me if I would object to telling him whether Minister
                                Caceres had discussed this with the Department. I replied that I had
                                had no discussion of this possibility with Señor Caceres, and that
                                so far as I knew it had not been discussed with anyone in the
                                Department. (Some time ago Minister Caceres suggested to me the
                                possibility of transferring a certain amount of Honduran territory
                                to Nicaragua in exchange for recognition of the award. The idea
                                presented by Señor Caceres seemed to be that action should be taken
                                through the Commission and no mention was made of direct
                                negotiation). In reply to Dr. DeBayle’s direct question as to the
                                attitude of the Government of the United States, I told him that I
                                had not been authorized to make any formal statement but that I felt
                                I could safely go so far as to say that the Department considered
                                the recent Honduran statement as a re-affirmation of that country’s
                                claims based on award of the King of Spain, and assumed that no
                                precipitate action would be taken by either of the countries, and
                                that efforts to facilitate an amicable solution of the difficulties
                                would continue. Minister DeBayle <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261"

                                the moment to “sit tight” and await further developments.</p>

                                them.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency states that, since three years have elapsed and the
                                Mediation Commission has not so far reached the final stage of its
                                mission, and its functions have been extended to take cognizance of
                                matters beyond its competence, the Honduran Government considers
                                that by these acts, which are incompatible with the fulfillment of
                                the Royal Award which determined the territorial rights of Honduras,
                                the Mediation Commission has already completed its task, in as much
                                as it is not pursuing such a settlement of the present dispute as
                                was agreed in the Pact of Mutual Offers,<note n="66"
                                    xml:id="d307fn2">Signed at San José December 10, 1937; for text,

                                not anticipated when the Pact was signed.</p>
                            <p>In noting these and the further statements in Your Excellency’s
                                communication, my Government assumes that they are intended merely
                                as a reaffirmation of the rights asserted by Honduras under the
                                terms of the Award of the King of Spain, that Your Excellency’s
                                Government will continue to observe the provisions of the pact
                                signed at San José de Costa Rica on December 10, 1937, and that it
                                will cooperate in efforts to facilitate a peaceful solution of the
                                controversy.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency will recall that the offer of good offices, in which
                                my Government was associated with the Governments of Costa Rica and
                                Venezuela on October 21, 1937 and which was accepted by Your
                                Excellency’s Government the following day,<note n="67"

                                envisaged that suggestions for a definitive settlement of the
                                dispute would be made. You will further recall that this offer made
                                it very clear that the suggestion as to the means which might be
                                adopted by Honduras and Nicaragua for the definitive settlement of
                                the controversy were to be equally acceptable to both parties. The
                                Mediation Commission, <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0272"

                                recommendations can be of use in the present controversy only if
                                they are acceptable to both parties.</p>
                            <p>In the light of all of these circumstances my Government is confident
                                that the best means to find a satisfactory solution of the
                                controversy is for the Mediation Commission to pursue its
                                efforts.</p>

                                Mediation in the frontier incident between Nicaragua and Honduras in
                                conformity with the Pact of Mutual Offers, Your Excellency’s
                                Government assumes that the reasons which Honduras adduces for

                                reaffirming the rights which it has always maintained regarding the
                                validity of the terms of the Award of the King of Spain, but not the
                                suspension of the labors of the former, and that it desires that my

                                at San José, Costa Rica, December 10, 1934 [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >1937</hi>], cooperating with its efforts to facilitate a
                                peaceful settlement of the controversy.</p>
                            <p>His Excellency likewise calls my attention to the fact that in
                                offering the good offices of his Government, together with those of
                                Costa Rica and Venezuela, in the matter to which I am referring,
                                suggestions for a definitive settlement were specifically
                                contemplated, and the idea was made clear that in order to have
                                legal value they would have to be accepted by both parties, since
                                the Mediation Commission does not possess the characteristics of an
                                Arbitral Tribunal, and that in view of all these circumstances Your
                                Excellency’s Government is confident that the best means for finding
                                a satisfactory solution of the controversy is for the Mediation
                                Commission to continue its efforts.</p>
                            <p>My Government, Excellency and Mr. Secretary, maintains and reaffirms
                                the contents of its note of June 13th, already mentioned, by which
                                it notified the members from the countries of the Delegates on <pb
                                    n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0273"/>the Mediation Commission of
                                the termination of its functions. The note to which I allude sets
                                forth clearly the reasons and legal grounds that Honduras has had
                                for proceeding in the way in which it is doing.</p>
                            <p>As I had the honor of stating in my note already referred to, the
                                friendly intervention of the Governments of the United States of
                                America, the United States of Venezuela and the Republic of Costa
                                Rica took place in order to avoid the tension and discord occasioned
                                by the issuance and sale of a postage stamp of the Republic of
                                Nicaragua on which the map of that nation is outlined, the boundary
                                line with Honduras laid down by the King of Spain in his arbitral
                                award being plainly altered.</p>
                            <p>On December 10, 1937, the Mediation Commission signed the Pact of
                                Mutual Offers which was likewise signed and approved by the
                                representatives of the two Governments. In that Pact it was stated
                                in one of its clauses “A mutual offer of the two Governments to
                                solve the present conflict by the pacific means sanctioned by
                                International Law,” and with those categorical affirmations,
                                tranquility and good harmony between the two sister nations were
                                insured.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting which the Commission held to suspend its work, it
                                indicated the period of two months, counting from April 9, 1938, to
                                June 9th of the same year, to resume it, if unforeseen circumstances
                                did not necessitate renewing it sooner. On June 3rd, when the period
                                was about to expire, Their Excellencies Zúñiga Montúfar and
                                Rodriguez were good enough to address a radio telegraph message to
                                this Chancellery, informing it that His Excellency Mr. Corrigan had
                                made known, in notes of May 23rd, that the studies being made on the
                                statements submitted to the Mediation Commission by the Delegations
                                of Honduras and Nicaragua required more time, and he proposed that
                                the continuation of the plenary sessions be postponed to a date
                                later than June 9th, and that for that reason it was absolutely
                                necessary to defer the date of continuation of the plenary sessions
                                of the Mediation Commission, and that when exact knowledge was had
                                of that date he would take pleasure in giving notice of it, for all
                                pertinent purposes.</p>
                            <p>At that stage of the mediation, this Chancellery received a note
                                signed on November 26, 1938, by the President of the Mediation
                                Commission, His Excellency Doctor Tobías Zúñiga Montúfar, in which
                                he was good enough to communicate that the American Geographical
                                Society had been requested to draw up a reconnaissance map of the
                                region of the Coco or Segovia River, and in this connection he
                                submitted a plan for performing the work and the estimate of its
                                cost, half of which would be paid by Honduras and half by Nicaragua
                                if the said plan won the approval of their Governments.</p>
                            <p>This Chancellery replied on December 31st of that year, stating that
                                the elaboration of the map referred to presupposed the setting aside
                                of the natural boundary established in the award, a boundary which
                                    <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0274"/>it is not possible for
                                my Government to vary, and I set forth at length the reasons on
                                which [my stand]<note n="70" xml:id="d308fn2">Brackets appear in the
                                    file translation.</note> was based, in the note which I had the
                                honor to address to Your Excellency on June 13th of the current
                                year. And in consideration of such reasons I regretted to have to
                                state to His Excellency the President of the Mediation Commission
                                that my Government deplored that it could not consent to a new
                                discussion on the territorial rights already decisively defined by
                                the civilized medium of arbitration.</p>
                            <p>On March 18, 1940, I addressed another note to His Excellency the
                                President of the Mediation Commission, for the reason that in those
                                days the newspapers of Costa Rica and Nicaragua had been announcing
                                the coming convocation of that [body]<note n="70" xml:id="d308fn3"
                                    >Brackets appear in the file translation.</note> to reach the
                                termination of its labors; it being said also that the cartographic
                                studies which would serve as a basis for the settlement that would
                                have to be recommended had been made. This last [statement]<note
                                    n="70" xml:id="d308fn4">Brackets appear in the file
                                    translation.</note> gave reason for alluding in that note to the
                                action of the Honorable John B. Ocheltree, who gave a private
                                lecture at the President’s House at Tegucigalpa, with projected
                                pictures, intended to show the need for the aerophotographic map
                                that was planned. And because of this lecture, my Government
                                reaffirmed the ideas of the note of December 31, 1938, and firmly
                                maintained its opinion with respect to the inviolability of the
                                award of the King of Spain, declaring that it could not accept any
                                settlement that would deviate from the corresponding part of the
                                text of the [offer of]<note n="70" xml:id="d308fn5">Brackets appear
                                    in the file translation.</note> Good Offices, in which it is
                                stated that <hi rend="italic">the three mediating Governments would

                                    that can be accepted by Honduras and Nicaragua with the object
                                    of reaching a definitive settlement of the conflict</hi>.</p>
                            <p>From everything that has been set forth, and in consideration of the
                                fact that more than three years have elapsed since June 9, 1938,
                                when the honorable Mediation Commission suspended its labors—and it
                                has not resumed them—to enter upon the final stage of its lofty
                                mission, having previously, indeed, taken steps which completely
                                deviate from the idea that the award is to be carried out that
                                determined the territorial rights of Honduras, my Government
                                maintains and reaffirms, as I have stated in the beginning, the
                                contents of its note of June 13th above-mentioned, in which it
                                declares terminated the labors of the honorable Mediation
                                Commission, with the desire that it be considered to have withdrawn
                                from the mediation, since it is necessary to terminate a situation
                                that cannot continue indefinite. And in maintaining and reaffirming
                                resolutely the note mentioned, it does so without there being any
                                ground for its decision being doubted, as it had declared in the
                                note alluded to that it could not give its acceptance <pb n="265"
                                    xml:id="pg_265" facs="0275"/>to any settlement whatever which
                                was not the due execution of the award, because of being under
                                obligation to defend thereby the integrity of the Honduran
                                territory; this declaration does not refer to the honorable
                                Mediation Commission, for its object is solely to make known the
                                standard of conduct imposed upon it by its constitutional
                                duties.</p>
                            <p>Through the worthy channel of Your Excellency I repeat to your
                                illustrious Government the regret of the Government of Honduras at
                                finding itself obliged to take this step, but it cannot fail to do
                                so in view of what is prescribed in the Constitution of the
                                Republic. Likewise I repeat to it its full gratitude for what could
                                be accomplished in the discharge of the good offices which it was
                                pleased to offer.</p>

                            <p>336. The President expressed his anxiety today regarding the apparent
                                decision of the Honduran Government to withdraw from its agreement
                                to accept mediation of the United States, Costa Rica and Venezuela
                                on the Honduran-Nicaraguan boundary dispute. President Calderon said
                                that indirectly attitude is due either to Nazi pressure in order to
                                create unrest in Central America or to President Cartas’ desire to
                                detract attention from internal difficulties by emphasizing
                                international matters.</p>
                            <p>The President expressed the hope that we would use our influence to
                                persuade Honduras to leave the boundary matter in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> at least until the end of the war. The

                                representations and he felt certain that the Venezuelan Government
                                would be glad to do likewise.</p>

                            <p>The Ambassador<note n="71" xml:id="d310fn1">Diógenes Escalante,
                                    Venezuelan Ambassador in Washington.</note> inquired what views
                                this Government had with respect to further action in connection
                                with the Nicaragua-Honduras boundary dispute.</p>
                            <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0276"/>
                            <p>He stated that his Government did not think that Honduras had any
                                authority to declare that the labors of the mediation commission had
                                come to an end.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador that this whole subject was now under review.
                                Our preliminary studies were in agreement with the view of his
                                Government—that the Government of Honduras could not unilaterally
                                declare that the mediation commission had ceased to exist because
                                its work had been terminated. It was our tentative thought that
                                there should be consultation between the Governments either through
                                the usual diplomatic channels or through a meeting of the mediation
                                commission to decide what the next step should be. I expressed my
                                personal doubt that there would be any favorable development if the
                                situation was left to drift since it did not look as though Honduras
                                intended, of its own initiative, to make any proposal and Nicaragua
                                alone was not in a position to bring about serious consideration of
                                any proposal it might make.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador seemed to agree that this was a good procedure. He
                                thought that whatever discussions took place should be through
                                diplomatic channels in order not to antagonize Honduras
                                unnecessarily.</p>

                            <p>353. My 336, November 15, 11 a.m. The Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                sent for me last evening to read to me the letter which he proposes
                                shortly to send to the Costa Rican Minister in Washington
                                instructing Fernández as to the attitude of the Costa Rican
                                Government regarding the expressed intention of Honduras to withdraw
                                from the boundary mediation (the Honduran attitude is expressed in a
                                note of October 9 from the Honduran Minister for Foreign Affairs to
                                the Costa Rican Minister for Foreign Affairs which is virtually the

                            <p>Echandi’s draft letter instructs Fernandez to suggest to the
                                Department that the Mediation Commission inform the Government of
                                Honduras that provided Honduras will not withdraw from the mediation
                                the three mediating governments will make no suggestions as to the
                                manner of determining the boundary to either Honduras or Nicaragua
                                at least until the end of the war, the Government of Costa Rica
                                being of the opinion that Honduran withdrawal at this moment <pb
                                    n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0277"/>would be a blow to
                                inter-American solidarity. For this reason the Government considers
                                it wiser to leave the determination of the boundary problem <hi
                                    rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> until the general international
                                danger has diminished.</p>
                            <p>Echandi said that there would be a preferable solution to the
                                foregoing: for us to persuade Honduras for the international reasons
                                stated above to defer taking action until the present international
                                crisis has passed. He expressed the opinion that we are the only
                                power which could successfully exert influence on the Honduran
                                Government in this matter. He said that he will send suitable
                                instructions to the Costa Rican Minister in Venezuela as soon as he
                                learns what our views are as to the most advisable procedure.</p>

                            <p>The Minister of Nicaragua called this afternoon at his request.</p>
                            <p>The Minister inquired with regard to the Nicaraguan-Honduran boundary
                                dispute situation. I told him that I was glad to say that the
                                Governments of Venezuela, Costa Rica and the United States were all
                                in accord in believing that the mediators should make a suggestion
                                to the two parties to the dispute to enter into an agreement that
                                neither side would take any steps, but would maintain the <hi

                                I said that as soon as the draft communications had been completed
                                to the satisfaction of the three governments I would be glad to
                                inform the Minister thereof. The Minister stated that his Government

                            June 14, 1941, the freezing control was extended to all of the countries
                            of the continent of Europe and nationals thereof.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the issuance of the proclamation, it was also announced
                            that in attaining the objectives of Executive Order No. 8389, as
                            amended, all efforts are being made to cause the least possible
                            interference with legitimate inter-American trade. With that end in view
                            the Treasury Department has issued a general license with respect to
                            inter-American trade transactions and the financial transactions
                            incidental thereto involving persons in the other American republics who
                            may be nationals of a European country designated in the order. This
                            general license will permit such classes of transactions without the
                            necessity of applying for specific licenses.</p>
                        <p>The general license, however, will not apply to persons so long as their
                            names appear on the proclaimed list. In addition, exporters and
                            importers in the United States may from time to time be advised by their
                            banks or otherwise that instructions have been issued by the Secretary
                            of the Treasury requiring specific license applications for trade
                            transactions involving certain persons in the other American republics
                            who are not named on the proclaimed list.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, financial transactions which are not incidental to licensed
                            trade transactions are not covered by the general license. With respect
                            to such purely financial transactions, appropriate specific licenses
                            will have to be obtained from the Treasury Department.</p>
                        <p>The proclaimed list will also serve as a guide to United States firms in
                            the selection of agents and representatives in the other American
                            republics.</p>

                        <p>The Minister explained that the proclaimed list of certain blocked
                            nationals is working a hardship commercially on Ecuador. He also stated
                            his belief that 25 per cent of the names now on the list for Ecuador
                            have been so placed on inadequate, inaccurate and false information. He
                            does not dispute the necessity for such a list but rather concurs in the
                            necessity therefor. He does, however, suggest that it would be more
                            equitable if the consent of the Ecuadoran Government were secured in
                            each instance before the name is placed on the list and announced by
                            this Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Geist thanked him for his suggestions and assured him that they would
                            receive full consideration by this Government, that it is to be
                            anticipated that certain injustices might be done, but that the
                            Department was continually working to eliminate them and make the list
                            as fair as possible. He also explained the purpose of the list. The
                            Minister concurred with what he said, but reiterated his desire that the
                            Government of Ecuador be consulted in all instances and promised full
                            cooperation in any such undertaking which he said could be successful
                            only on the basis of full and mutual understanding.</p>

                        <p>From September through December 1940 a visiting group of officials of the
                            Office of the Coordinator of Commercial and Cultural Relations between
                            the American Republics (now the Office of the Coordinator of
                            Inter-American Affairs), which included representatives of the
                            Department of State and the Federal Bureau of Investigation made a
                            survey of the nature and extent of the problem arising from the
                            representation of American business by undesirable firms throughout the
                            other American Republics. This survey was undertaken not as a primary
                            investigation of these situations but was carried out primarily through
                            consultation with the American diplomatic missions on the basis of the
                            information then available to the missions and certain well-informed
                            American residents recommended by the missions for such consultations.
                            The reports made from each mission by the visiting group and the
                            missions’ reports which have been made on this subject furnished the
                            factual basis for the cooperative program which was carried out by the
                            Coordinator’s Office in conjunction with the Department and the
                            Department of Commerce during the first six months of 1941. This program
                            was designed to enlist the voluntary cooperation of American
                            foreign-trade firms in replacing agencies or sales outlets which
                            appeared to be undesirable under existing <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"
                                facs="0282"/>conditions. The Department of Commerce and the American
                            foreign service officers in the field assisted such American firms in
                            obtaining satisfactory replacements. In the course of this cooperative
                            program the problem was taken up individually with more than a thousand
                            American firms and some 17,000 American companies generally interested
                            in export trade were formally informed of the program and requested to
                            check any new accounts with the Department of Commerce or the
                            Coordinator’s Office in order to avoid establishing new relations with
                            undesirable or questionable firms and particularly to prevent American
                            firms from unwittingly taking on undesirable firms which had been
                            dropped by other American companies cooperating with the Government’s
                            program.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that by the end of June 1941 this program had resulted in
                            substantially arresting the problem and in preparing American business
                            for the more stringent regulatory controls which were being applied by
                            the Export Control authorities and the Treasury Department in the
                            administration of the “freezing orders”, Executive Order No. 8389, as
                            amended. By the end of June 1941 upwards of 1,000 accounts had been
                            terminated with undesirable firms.</p>
                        <p>The information concerning undesirable firms which was collected in
                            connection with this program was made available throughout this period
                            to the Administrator of Export Control and was used by the Export
                            Control authorities in passing on license applications for products
                            which were subject to control. On June 17, 1941 the “freezing” of
                            foreign funds and related transactions was extended to additional
                            countries including Germany and Italy and nationals thereof. With this
                            extension of the regulatory controls which potentially embraced the
                            principal portion of American foreign trade and financial transactions,
                            it rapidly became necessary to integrate and develop the handling of
                            information and lists relating to undesirable trading connections. The
                            Department by strictly confidential circular telegram of June 21,
                                1941<note n="8" xml:id="d316fn1">Not printed.</note> requested the
                            missions to review the British Statutory List and to indicate such
                            omissions from and additions to this list as were desirable for the
                            purpose of administration of the freezing controls by the Treasury
                            Department. On the basis of the replies from the missions a list was
                            prepared by the Department and made available for the immediate use of
                            the Treasury. At the same time steps were taken to utilize this list in
                            supplementing the information being used by the Export Control
                            authorities.</p>

                        <p>The question of publishing a list of undesirable firms in connection with
                            some regulatory authority had been under general consideration. The
                            necessity of integrating so far as possible the handling of these
                            matters by the regulatory authorities concerned and the severe
                            dislocation to American trading and financial business with the other
                            American Republics which was threatened unless this integration could be
                            effected and the business community given public guidance on the
                            question made it imperative to arrange for the publication of a list.
                            Accordingly, on July 17, 1941 the President by Proclamation provided for
                            the publication of “The Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals”
                            which was first issued on that date. The President’s proclamation
                            provides that the list shall be prepared by the Secretary of State in
                            conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General,
                            the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of Export Control, and the
                            Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The list as issued July 17, 1941
                            was prepared by these agencies on the basis of the information
                            previously forwarded by the missions, including the names on the British
                            Statutory List which had been approved by the missions for “freezing”
                            purposes in reply to the Department’s circular telegraphic instruction
                            of June 21, 1941.</p>
                        <p>It was recognized that despite the efforts of those engaged in preparing
                            the initial list to leave off cases concerning which there appeared to
                            be any doubt on the basis of available information, there were bound,
                            under the circumstances, to be cases which would be the subject of
                            reconsideration shortly after publication. Accordingly, Supplement No. 1
                            to the Proclaimed List, dated July 28, 1941 was devoted solely to such
                            deletions and corrections as were immediately possible. These deletions
                            were made on the basis of the missions’ replies to the Department’s
                            strictly confidential circular telegraphic instruction of June 19,
                                1941.<note n="9" xml:id="d316fn2">Not printed.</note></p>

                        <p>Immediately upon the issuance of the President’s proclamation of July 17,
                            1941 and the issuance of the initial list on that date, the Department
                            took steps to fulfill its primary responsibility with respect to the
                            preparation of the list by establishing within the Department on July
                            21, 1941 the Division of World Trade Intelligence (symbol WT). This step
                            was effected by transferring to the Department the personnel of the
                            Special Division of the Coordinator’s Office, which <pb n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274" facs="0284"/>division had had charge of the
                            administration of the cooperative program up to that time. The Director
                            of the Coordinator’s Special Division<note n="10" xml:id="d316fn3">John
                                S. Dickey.</note> was at the same time designated Acting Chief of
                            the Division of World Trade Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>The publication of the Proclaimed List brought the cooperative program
                            largely to a close. Henceforth the Coordinator’s Office and the
                            Department will not make recommendations for replacement other than in
                            exceptional cases unless a firm is on the Proclaimed List. The
                            Department of Commerce will continue to furnish American firms on
                            inquiry with pertinent information concerning firms not on the
                            Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>Under Departmental Order No. 956, of July 21, 1941,<note n="11"

                                    >Bulletin</hi>, July 26, 1941, p. 78.</note> the Division of
                            World Trade Intelligence is charged with handling “the activities and
                            problems envisaged in the President’s Proclamation of July 17, 1941,
                            relating to trade with aliens whose interests are inimical to the United
                            States.” The Division functions under the general administrative
                            supervision of Assistant Secretary Dean Acheson in close collaboration
                            with the Division of Commercial Affairs and the other divisions and

                        <p>The Secretary of State has designated Assistant Secretary Acheson
                            Chairman of an Interdepartmental Committee on The Proclaimed List to
                            integrate the participation of the departments and agencies named in the
                            President’s proclamation in the preparation of the Proclaimed List. A
                            subcommittee with similar representation has been established under the
                            chairmanship of the Acting Chief of the Division of World Trade
                            Intelligence to pass on all cases proposed for addition to and deletion
                            from the list.</p>
                        <p>The Division of World Trade Intelligence is at present primarily
                            concerned with gathering, analyzing, digesting and recording all
                            available information concerning firms or individuals which are
                            considered undesirable trading or financial connections for American
                            firms under existing conditions. This information is being gathered and
                            organized so that each case may be considered on its merits in respect
                            to the Proclaimed List. As the information becomes available the list
                            will be extended to cover other countries in addition to the other
                            American Republics.</p>

                        <p>Additions to and deletions from the Proclaimed List can be made only with
                            the publication of supplements based upon administrative orders signed
                            by the six departments and agencies specified in the <pb n="275"
                                xml:id="pg_275" facs="0285"/>President’s proclamation of July 17,
                            1941. Supplement No. 1 containing certain deletions and amendments was
                            issued July 28, 1941 and it is anticipated that Supplement No. 2
                            containing additions, deletions and amendments will be issued sometime
                            shortly after September 1, 1941. Thereafter it is expected that
                            supplements will be issued from time to time at intervals of
                            approximately three weeks. The supplements will be collated and
                            published as a basic revision quarterly or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>As a general policy only names will be considered for addition or
                            deletion on which a report has been received from the missions and in no
                            event will additions or deletions be made until the proposed action has
                            been communicated to the mission concerned for its final approval. The
                            urgency with which these matters must generally be handled will
                            necessitate the use of telegraphic communications in most instances.
                            When the mission is notified that action is proposed on certain cases a
                            telegraphic reply should be made usually within three days unless
                            otherwise instructed; such replies should state that the proposed action
                            is approved or not recommended or that postponement of action is
                            recommended in specific cases. Unless otherwise advised the mission may
                            generally assume that such final recommendations will be followed by the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>It will be recognized that the prompt transmission of current information
                            and recommendations from the field is imperative if this program is to
                            be administered efficiently and effectively. It must be emphasized that
                            while the missions’ recommendations are desired on all cases and are
                            given primary weight in the interdepartmental deliberations, <hi
                                rend="italic">the general rule will be to take no action on a case
                                unless the underlying information supporting such action is
                                available here</hi>. The Department’s ability to secure action in
                            the interdepartmental committee will depend upon the extent and
                            character of the information furnished. In reporting on firms proposed
                            for deletion or addition particular care must be exercised to review all
                            previous reports submitted on the firm in despatches, world trade
                            directory reports or otherwise so as to avoid unexplained
                            inconsistencies in the information on presentation of the case to the
                            interdepartmental committee. Previous unfavorable reports should be
                            disposed of in detail whenever a deletion is recommended. When
                            recommendations for additions or deletions are made by telegram a
                            summary of the salient facts underlying the recommendation in each case
                            should be included in the same telegram and reference made to the
                            airmail despatch furnishing full particulars. In order to facilitate the

                            whenever secrecy in transmission is not essential; the brown code should
                            be used, for the transmission of information of a confidential

                        <p>The underlying objective of the Proclaimed List is to prevent American
                            firms and individuals from engaging in trading or financial transactions
                            with persons who are identified directly or indirectly with objectives
                            and activities inimical to the national defense policies of this
                            Government and in particular the hemispheric defense policies of the
                            American Republics. To this end we seek to deny to such persons the
                            financial assistance and prestige resulting from the maintenance of
                            commercial and financial connections with the United States under
                            existing conditions. This Government is endeavoring in every feasible
                            way to cooperate with the other American Republics to assure that their
                            internal economies will not be disastrously disrupted by the loss of
                            former markets and sources of supply due to the war. In many instances
                            these efforts will entail sacrifices here and it is a natural and proper
                            concern of this Government that such sacrifices should not be made for
                            the benefit of firms and persons known to be unfriendly to the defense
                            policies of this country. In other words, the Proclaimed List and the
                            related controls of trade and financial transactions are designed for
                            the protection of this country and of the other American Republics; the
                            list is not to be used to place the handling of American products solely
                            or principally in American hands and it will not be administered to
                            serve selfish or acquisitive trade ends.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that it is not possible to state precisely the factors
                            which are to be taken into account in recommending specific firms for
                            inclusion on the list. These factors will vary from country to country
                            and from case to case depending upon local circumstances. Certain
                            general considerations may be noted: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Persons should not be recommended for inclusion merely because
                                    of German, Italian or Japanese nationality, although this fact
                                    should be reported wherever known.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Consideration should be given to the position which a firm
                                    occupies as an essential part of the local economy. In all cases
                                    where the firm appears to be indubitably essential to the local
                                    economy, careful attention should be given to the possibility
                                    that the undesirable influences within the firm can be
                                    eliminated or controlled if the question is discreetly handled.
                                    All such situations should be fully reported with your
                                    recommendations.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>All cases should be fully reported where inclusion on the list
                                    would be called for except for local political considerations.
                                    It is to be noted that although such cases will continue to
                                    arise, they must be most carefully weighed since this approach
                                    is usually resorted to by the larger and frequently most serious
                                    offenders in endeavoring to avoid inclusion or to secure removal
                                    from the list. There is good reason to believe that
                                    indiscriminate acceptance of such considerations frequently
                                    results in an unfavorable local impression and eventual <pb

                                    formulated. It is recognized that this entire question is highly
                                    complicated and will involve problems arising from the existence
                                    of contracts entered into prior to July 17, 1941; and in some
                                    countries local laws will have to be taken into account. Further
                                    instructions are being prepared on these aspects and pending the

                        <p>So far as possible the Department desires each case reported on,
                            considered by the mission on the basis of certain basic factors.
                            Enclosure 1 entitled “Chart of Certain Unit Factors Used In Rating” has
                            been prepared on the basis of the experience gained in analyzing
                            information submitted on this subject by the missions during the past
                            year. The ratings assigned to the various factors are intended to
                            indicate generally the significance attached to the specific factors and
                            to give the mission some precise guidance concerning the factors taken
                            into account here in rating firms for internal administrative purposes.
                            A firm or individual is not necessarily given an “A” rating merely
                            because of one “A” factor but it may be; similarly several “C–A” or “C”
                            factors taken together may result in an “A” rating for the firm. Each
                            case must be evaluated on its merits and any recommendation of the
                            mission is given careful consideration. The Department believes that the
                            value of recommendations submitted by the missions will be increased if
                            they are related generally to a uniform pattern of rating factors.</p>
                        <p>The “Chart of Certain Unit Factors Used in Rating” is furnished merely as
                            a general guide and it is not intended to routinize the reporting on
                            this basis nor is it intended that the missions should attempt to rate
                            specific factors in their reports. However, any available information
                            bearing on the factors set forth in Enclosure 1 should be furnished for
                            each case and it will be helpful to have the mission indicate any
                            special reasons why specific factors reported should not be evaluated on
                            the basis of the rating assigned on the chart. Reference is also made to
                            Enclosure 2 of strictly confidential circular instruction of February 7,
                            1941, File No. 164.12/2923A,<note n="12" xml:id="d316fn5">Not
                                printed.</note> with respect to other items <pb n="278"

                            furnished. The despatch referred to related primarily to undesirable
                            agencies but the information requested, so far as applicable, should now
                            be furnished for any firm or individual considered an undesirable
                            commercial or financial connection within the purview of this
                            instruction.</p>
                        <p>The firms and individuals reported on are assigned ratings here on the
                            basis of all available information. An “A” rating is given to persons
                            with respect to whom there is “conclusive” information establishing the
                            undesirability of the person as a trading or financial connection for
                            American firms under existing conditions. Ordinarily “A” cases will be
                            considered for inclusion on the Proclaimed List. The “C–A” rating is
                            used for two types of cases: (1) those on which the information,
                            although reliable, is not sufficiently serious to justify an “A” rating,
                            and (2) those on which the information, although of a serious nature, is
                            not sufficiently reliable or current to warrant an “A” rating. The “C”
                            rating is used for the remaining cases which are under suspicion and
                            require further observation. The former “B” rating has been superseded
                            by the use of the letter “S” placed behind either “A”, “C–A” or “C”
                            cases which because of political factors or other special circumstances
                            require special treatment (thus “A–S”, “C–A–S” or “C–S”).</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the “Chart of Certain Unit Factors Used in Rating”
                            draws a distinction between “Conclusive” and “Inconclusive” information.
                            Information furnished by the missions or other official sources without
                            specific indication that the reliability of the information is unknown
                            or questioned is generally considered to be reliable and therefore
                            “conclusive” for rating purposes. The significance attached to
                            “conclusive” information, as indicated on the chart, depends upon the
                            importance of the factor. “Inconclusive” information covers both
                            information the reliability of which is specifically questioned and
                            unconfirmed data received here from unofficial sources.</p>
                        <p>Most of the factors listed on the chart do not require comment, but it
                            should be noted that the applicability and significance of many factors
                            will vary with the nationality of the firm or individual concerned. In
                            reference to the factor designated “Preference for Axis Trade”
                            consideration must be given to the nature of the trade involved, e.g. if
                            Germany was the logical or sole source of supply for a product the fact
                            that a firm purchased principally or substantially from Germany might
                            not be significant. On the other hand if a firm served as a principal or
                            substantial supplier to Germany of a product which might have been
                            secured from other firms in the same market there is usually good reason
                            to believe that the firm in question, at least in recent years, was <hi
                                rend="italic">persona grata</hi> with the Nazi authorities. Certain
                            of these general variations are reflected in the chart, others <pb
                                n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0289"/>must be taken into account and
                            indicated by the individual missions as particular circumstances and
                            local conditions necessitate.</p>
                        <p>The mission’s recommendation with respect to the rating to be assigned
                            firms as they are reported on will be helpful and the mission’s opinion
                            is desired on all cases proposed for addition to or deletion from the
                            Proclaimed List. It is to be reemphasized, however, that such
                            recommendations and opinions should be supported in all cases by
                            detailed statements of the underlying facts. For example, in reporting
                            on “cloaks” in addition to stating that a firm is acting as a “cloak”
                            the mission should give the facts with respect to specific transactions
                            which establish that the firm is so acting. Similarly, whenever
                            compatible with the understanding on which information is acquired, the
                            mission should indicate the source of its information. Whenever it is
                            not feasible or desirable to disclose the source of information the
                            mission’s opinion concerning the reliability of the source should be
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>Whenever a firm is recommended for inclusion on the Proclaimed List, care
                            should be taken to give the accurate address of the firm and to indicate
                            the location of all branches which should be listed as well as the names
                            and business addresses of any individuals connected with the firm who
                            should be separately listed.</p>
                        <p>Unless the mission indicates otherwise it is assumed that all factors
                            reported have current significance. If a report indicates that certain
                            factors were known to be present some years ago but are no longer
                            present, the significance which is attached to the factor depends upon
                            the nature of the factor. Factors relating to political attitudes which
                            are not known to have been operative since 1936 are generally given a
                            lower rating here in evaluating the present status of the firm since
                            prior to that time the nature of the totalitarian movement and its
                            activities in the hemisphere were not as widely appreciated as has been
                            the case in recent years.</p>
                        <p>It is contemplated that improvements and further clarification of the
                            chart will be developed on the basis of subsequent experience here and
                            in the field.</p>
                        <p>In reporting on the political status of trading and financial connections
                            under existing conditions it is to be borne in mind that even though a
                            particular firm may not be included on the Proclaimed List, the
                            information may be used by the Department of Commerce in advising
                            American firms and by the licensing authorities in the administration of
                            the trading and financial controls. For example any firm with an “A”,
                            “C–A”, or “C” rating would not ordinarily be considered by the
                            Department of Commerce as a recommendable connection for American firms
                            under existing conditions. Likewise, Export Control takes into account
                            many factors in passing on license applications. <pb n="280"

                            should be indicated in your reports and conversely any such specific
                            application of the information which you think advisable should be

                        <p>The same general procedure will be followed in making deletions as has
                            been set forth above for additions to the list, i.e., upon receipt of
                            information here indicating that removal of a firm should be considered
                            the case will be presented to the interdepartmental committee; if the
                            proposed action is approved by the committee the mission will be
                            notified by telegram and unless objection is then raised by the mission
                            the action will be taken with the publication of the next Supplement to
                            the list.</p>
                        <p>Many inquiries are being received by the Department and by the missions
                            concerning the procedure to be followed by firms in having their names
                            removed from the list. The Department is stating in reply to such
                            inquiries that any information available to American companies here
                            indicating that a particular firm should be removed from the list may be
                            submitted to the Department which will see that careful consideration is
                            given the matter by the appropriate authorities and that the firm which
                            is included on the list may present similar information and its
                            representations to the mission or the nearest American consulate. In
                            reply to such inquiries it is stated that the list as published is not
                            final and that additions and deletions will be made from time to time on
                            the basis of continuing study and current developments.</p>
                        <p>It is not, of course, possible to indicate the action which must be taken
                            by firms generally in order to have a case removed from the list. Each
                            case must be dealt with on its individual merits and the question of
                            indicating to a firm the unsatisfactory factors in a case with a view to
                            having them remedied must be left to the discretion of the missions.
                            Generally such considerations are not revealed by the Department in
                            response to written inquiries, but on occasion these matters are frankly
                            discussed with American firms in conference. As a general rule firms
                            cannot be considered for removal from the list until clean-cut evidence
                            is forthcoming that the unsatisfactory conditions which resulted in the
                            firm’s inclusion have been remedied and the mission is satisfied that
                            the future conduct of the firm can be expected to be satisfactory.
                            Ordinarily the burden of proof must be carried by the firm in question
                            to establish these conditions to the satisfaction of the mission.</p>
                        <p>Where special considerations are involved relating to the unique <pb

                        <p>The question has been raised as to what procedure, if any, is to be
                            adopted by this Government for receiving formal “undertakings” assuring
                            satisfactory conduct from firms as a condition precedent to not listing
                            a firm or to removal from the list. The British authorities have been
                            taking such undertakings in certain cases and on occasion the results
                            have apparently not been entirely satisfactory. For the present, this
                            Government will not require such formal undertakings as a general
                            policy. However, you are authorized to request or receive such informal
                            assurances, either orally or in writing, as may appear to you to be
                            useful in particular cases. In all cases where such assurances are
                            received it should be made clear to the firm that the mere giving of an
                            assurance does not guarantee the firm’s removal from the list nor does
                            it assure a firm that it will not be placed on the list at any time in
                            the future when in this Government’s opinion circumstances require such
                            action. It should be made clear that any assurances which are given will
                            be communicated to the authorities in Washington for consideration in
                            the light of all the circumstances. Except in those cases where the
                            mission considers it necessary to initiate consideration of removal of a
                            firm because of special circumstances, the mission should not solicit
                            such assurances for the purpose of initiating consideration of the firm
                            for deletion. The question of soliciting assurances in such special
                            cases is left to the mission’s discretion. The opinions of the missions
                            concerning the feasibility and advisability of establishing a procedure
                            for receiving standardized, formal undertakings will be helpful to
                            further consideration of this question.</p>
                        <p>In any discussions relating to the deletion of a firm on which you may
                            make a favorable recommendation you should make clear to the firm that
                            if it subsequently becomes necessary to consider the firm for inclusion
                            a second time the fact that the firm was previously removed from the
                            list will count heavily against it and that very rarely, if ever, will a
                            firm be considered for deletion after having been put on the list a
                            second time.</p>

                        <p>The British Embassy here has taken up with the Department the question of
                            establishing close cooperation here and in the field on <pb n="282"
                                xml:id="pg_282" facs="0292"/>matters relating to the Statutory List

                                of the joint directors of the British Ministry of Economic Warfare,
                                who was appointed on March 20, 1941, to take charge of economic
                                warfare matters at the Embassy, with the rank of Minister.</note>
                            The British missions have been instructed to maintain close contact with
                            our missions on these matters and the Department desires that you
                            maintain close contact with their missions for the purpose of
                            establishing free and full exchanges of information and views on
                            individual cases being considered for inclusion on or deletion from the
                            respective lists. In line with the Department’s general policy of not
                            acting jointly with the British on matters pertaining to the other
                            American Republics care should be exercised that such cooperation is not
                            in the nature of joint action. Moreover, such cooperation should be
                            carried on in such a way as to avoid giving any impression to firms or
                            to the government to which you are accredited that joint action is
                            involved in these matters. For example, the Department considers it
                            inadvisable that these matters should be discussed with a firm in a
                            joint interview with the British.</p>
                        <p>There is complete agreement between us concerning the desirability of
                            having our lists and policies on these questions generally in harmony
                            and it is believed that a full and free exchange of information and
                            views on individual cases will serve this end.</p>
                        <p>We have been informed that the British missions have been instructed to
                            report on all cases included on our list which are not on the Statutory
                            List with a view to having such cases considered for inclusion on their
                            list. In the meantime steps have been taken to discourage British trade
                            with all firms on the Proclaimed List. The British authorities here have
                            discussed with us the text of comprehensive revised instructions which
                            London proposes shortly to send to the British missions. These
                            instructions as drafted contemplate, it appears to us, a rather drastic
                            reorientation of their listing policies away from the narrow trading
                            with the enemy concept towards a broader concept which embraces the
                            principal factors with which we have been principally concerned. It is
                            to be noted that this development had taken place before the United
                            States Proclaimed List was announced and it is believed that as a result
                            of the publication of our list and the subsequent discussions which have
                            been held here the new British instructions will be based on policies
                            substantially parallel to our own. Close contact will continue to be
                            maintained between us here both on individual cases and on questions of
                            general policy pertaining to these matters.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that in the future there will be generally a close <pb
                                n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0293"/>parallel on cases added to and
                            deleted from the respective lists, but it is not contemplated that this
                            will be in the nature of simultaneous publication or that the same
                            action will necessarily be taken on all cases. It is desirable that you
                            should indicate what action the British mission is taking on all cases
                            proposed for addition to or deletion from our list.</p>

                            portion of the President’s proclamation of July 17, 1941 authorizing the
                            publication of the Proclaimed List, which is based on Section 5(<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) of the Act of October 6, 1917,<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d316fn8">40 Stat. 411, 415.</note> as amended, provide that
                            the transactions covered thereby are prohibited without license.
                            Accordingly, the power rests with the Treasury Department to grant or
                            deny licenses for any transaction covered by the order. Moreover, under
                            unusual circumstances the Treasury Department may issue licenses for
                            specific transactions with firms on the Proclaimed List to the extent
                            that the freezing order is applicable. Furthermore, the exportation from
                            the United States to firms on the Proclaimed List of any article covered
                            by the Export Control Act is not permitted unless a license is also
                            obtained in accordance with Section 3 of the proclamation. Each such
                            case is decided on its merits and the Department will endeavor to see
                            that relevant policy considerations receive careful attention by the
                            licensing authorities.</p>
                        <p>As matters now stand, ordinary commercial transactions with the American
                            Republics may be carried out, pursuant to Treasury General License No.
                            53, with any firm not on the Proclaimed List. An export control license
                            is necessary, however, if the product involved is exported from the
                            United States and is subject to control.</p>

                            Proclamation of July 17, 1941, authorizing the issuance of the
                            Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals, the objectives of which
                            have been explained in the enclosure to circular instruction of the
                            Department dated September 9, 1941.<note n="16" xml:id="d317fn1">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>With a view to accomplishing these objectives, it is hoped that the
                            effect of the program herein outlined will be to cut off, as completely
                            as possible, all relationships between persons subject to the
                            jurisdiction of the United States of America and Proclaimed List
                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>Certain types of cases have already been brought to the attention of the
                            Department, and they are presented below, in general categories, with
                            comments for your guidance. Wherever reference is made to “Proclaimed
                            List nationals”, the term should be understood to include others to the
                            extent that they are known to be acting for the benefit of such
                            Proclaimed List nationals.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that this instruction is limited in scope primarily to
                            relations of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
                            with Proclaimed List nationals. The Governments of several of the
                            American Republics have already inquired of this Government as to the
                            measures which they may take further to implement the Proclamation and
                            to attain its objectives. You will, from time to time, receive separate
                            instructions as to suggestions to be made in such instances. (See
                            Circular Instruction dated September 9, 1941). It is hoped that, with
                            the cooperation of the Governments of the American Republics, plans may
                            be worked out which will be sufficiently comprehensive to embrace
                            transactions between local concerns and Proclaimed List nationals.</p>
                        <p>These instructions set forth the standard of conduct which this
                            Government expects United States concerns to follow in their dealings
                            with persons on the Proclaimed List. The categories enumerated are not,
                            of course, all-inclusive. With respect to situations not covered herein,
                            you may be guided by the principles set forth with respect to the
                            situations herein dealt with. If any other important categories come to
                            your attention which you feel require specific instructions, please
                            advise this Department immediately.</p>
                        <p>If a United States concern refuses to follow the standard of conduct <pb

                            the following sanctions might be employed in connection with such
                            concern: <list>

                                    operations are concerned. This will also subject to control any
                                    relationships between this country and branches of such concern

                                <item>Such concern or merely its Latin American branches, without
                                    being placed on the Proclaimed List might be treated as a

                                    United States blocked. The business activities of the concern in
                                    the United States or all financial and trade relationships with
                                    its branches in the American Republics may thereby be subjected
                                    to licensing control.</item>

                                <item>Such concern might be prosecuted criminally for violations of
                                    the provisions of the freezing control order and the

                        <p>It is essential that United States concerns follow the standard of
                            conduct set forth herein, not only because the cessation of all
                            relationships between such concerns and the Proclaimed List nationals is
                            in itself important in accomplishing the objectives of the Proclaimed
                            List, but also because refusal to adopt such standard of conduct by
                            United States concerns would have a harmful effect on the attitude of
                            the local governments of those American Republics who are attempting to
                            cooperate with this Government and with whom we are attempting to work
                            out plans for restricting the dealings of local non-United States
                            concerns with Proclaimed List nationals.</p>

                        <p>The United States banks which have branches in the American Republics are
                            being advised by the Treasury Department that such branches may not
                            extend credit or render service of any other kind to Proclaimed List
                            nationals except under license. Such branches are <pb n="288"
                                xml:id="pg_288" facs="0298"/>required to make every reasonable
                            effort to force the immediate liquidation of all outstanding loans to
                            such persons with respect to loans repayable on demand; when loans are
                            payable at some fixed maturity, repayment must be required as of the
                            earliest maturity date. With respect to deposit account relationships
                            with Proclaimed List nationals, branches of United States banks may not
                            receive new deposits of local currency from such persons except under
                            license and must close out all such accounts and complete the
                            liquidation of all such transactions. Thereafter no transactions may be
                            engaged in except those incidental to the clearing of checks deposited
                            to the credit of depositors not on the Proclaimed List, but with respect
                            to which checks Proclaimed List nationals may have had some
                            interest.</p>

                        <p>It is realized that adequate banking facilities may nevertheless be made
                            available to Proclaimed List nationals by local banks. It is hoped,
                            however, that with the cooperation of the governments concerned local
                            banks may eventually be required to take parallel action.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury Department is also advising these United States banks that
                            transactions by their branches in the American Republics in United
                            States dollars are subject to the provisions of the Proclamation and
                            Executive Order No. 8389; that no such transaction may be consummated
                            and even liquidating transactions may not be carried forward, except
                            pursuant to license. The United States banks also are being advised that
                            their branches must immediately set aside that portion of the United
                            States dollar deposits carried with their own head offices or other
                            banks within the United States which represents their equivalent
                            liabilities in terms of United States dollars to Proclaimed List
                            nationals. Thereafter such branches may not engage in any transactions
                            in United States dollars with, for the account of, or for the benefit of
                            any Proclaimed List national except under license.</p>
                        <p>If any prohibited transactions carried on by branches of United States

                            come to your attention, you should immediately report the matter in
                            detail to the Department.</p>

                        <p> 11. <hi rend="italic">In those cases where the issue is raised that the
                                failure to perform a particular transaction will result in the
                                United States concern involved being held liable, for breach of
                                contract or otherwise, wider local law, you should be guided by the
                                following considerations:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You should bear in mind that where a license is required under the
                            Proclamation of July 17, 1941, and Executive Order No. 8389, the refusal
                            to grant such a license by the United States Government means that such
                            transaction can not be performed without violating the laws of the
                            United States. Accordingly, the United States concern may, depending
                            upon all the circumstances, be able to excuse performance under local
                            law by reason of the fact that the performance is impossible under the
                            laws of the United States. Of course, whether this defense of
                            “impossibility of performance” would be recognized by the competent
                            local authorities as a valid defense may depend upon a number of
                            factors. In such cases, you should attempt to ascertain from such
                            sources as you may deem desirable how the local authorities <pb n="292"
                                xml:id="pg_292" facs="0302"/>are apt to react in such a situation
                            and you should report your findings on this question to the Department
                            as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p> 12. <hi rend="italic">In those cases where you deem such action to be
                                warranted, you should refer to the Department specific requests for

                                In such cases you should include a detailed report of the relevant
                                facts together with your considered recommendation, having

                        <p>Treasury Department is advising United States banks which have branches
                            in the American republics with respect to the policy to be followed in
                            dealing with Proclaimed List nationals. It is understood that the
                            central offices in this country will advise the local branches in detail
                            with respect to these policies which are to be put into effect on Monday
                            September 29.</p>
                        <p>In general such branches are not to extend credit or render other
                            services to Proclaimed List nationals except under license. Reasonable
                            efforts are to be made to force the immediate liquidation of outstanding
                            loans and new deposits of Proclaimed List nationals will not be accepted
                            and existing deposit relationships are to be terminated. Thereafter no
                            transactions may be engaged in except those incidental to the clearing
                            of checks deposited to the credit of depositors not on the Proclaimed
                            List, but with respect to which checks Proclaimed List nationals may
                            have had some interest.</p>
                        <p>No transactions by such branches in United States dollars may be
                            consummated except pursuant to license and such branches must set aside
                            that portion of the United States dollar deposits carried with their own
                            head offices or other banks within the United States which represents
                            their equivalent liabilities in terms of United States dollars to

                            policy of branches of United States banks in the American republics with
                            respect to Proclaimed List nationals. British and Canadian banks in

                            September 29. American banks are being instructed not to accept new
                            accounts for persons on British statutory list even though such persons
                            are not on Proclaimed List and to send complete information to Treasury
                            as to all existing accounts of such persons. It would appear advisable
                            for you to keep in close contact with British missions on all questions
                            involving relationship with banks to Proclaimed List nationals, but it
                            would be undesirable to have any formal joint clearance on matters

                        <p>356. From the Under Secretary. The Chilean Ambassador<note n="17a"
                                xml:id="d320fn1">Rodolfo Michels.</note> called to see me this
                            morning to convey to me instructions he had received from his Foreign
                            Minister. These instructions implied that the recent inclusion of
                            additional names on the Chilean Black List involved some form of
                            unwarranted interference by the United States in the domestic affairs of
                            Chile in derogation of Chilean sovereignty. I said to the Ambassador
                            that I was surprised at his reporting a message of this character
                            inasmuch as when the Black List was originally published it had been
                            made entirely clear by this Government and by its representatives that
                            the proclamation by the President of the Black List had resulted from
                            the fact that many individuals and firms throughout the Americas had
                            been availing themselves of the financial and commercial connections
                            which they had in the United States in order to undertake activities
                            directed against the <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0305"/>United
                            States and directed as well against inter-American solidarity and
                            against the best interests of all of the American Republics at a very
                            critical moment in the history of the world when frank and full
                            cooperation between all of the American Republics is imperative and at a
                            moment when all obstacles to cooperation should be eliminated. I
                            reiterated various other reasons already made clear and said that I did
                            not agree for a moment that the action taken by this Government
                            warranted an interpretation that such action constituted interference in
                            the domestic concerns of the other American Republics.</p>
                        <p>I added that, inasmuch as the Ambassador and I had always spoken with the
                            utmost frankness regarding all questions involving the interests of our
                            two countries, I had recently received reports which I trusted were
                            unfounded that the Chilean Government was endeavoring to secure the
                            support of other American governments to a protest to the United States
                            against the Black List. (For your strictly confidential information, a
                            report to this effect has just come from the Embassy in Rio de
                                Janeiro.)<note n="18" xml:id="d320fn2">Telegram No. 1392, September
                                29, 1941, not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In conclusion I said that all of our missions have standing instructions
                            to report immediately to the Department of State if they believe that
                            the inclusion of any names in the Black List is unjustified or if they
                            feel that any names should be eliminated from the Black List, and that
                            consequently I assumed that if the Foreign Minister possessed reasons
                            which made him believe that the addition of the new names to which he
                            referred was unjust or due to erroneous information, he would at once
                            communicate his reasons for requesting the exclusion of such names to
                            your Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep you informed of any further evidence the Department may
                            receive indicating that the Chilean Government is in fact trying to pave
                            the way for a joint protest against the Black List, but in the meantime
                            I believe it would be helpful for you to have a conversation with the
                            Foreign Minister at an early moment and ascertain what his real reasons
                            may be for the instructions he has sent to Ambassador Michels.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: The Chilean Ambassador called on me
                            yesterday evening and discussed at some length the views of his
                            Government <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0306"/>regarding the
                            Proclaimed List. He emphasized that the Chilean Government had at no
                            time had any intention of taking the initiative in any sort of a
                            collective protest regarding this matter, but that apparently Chilean
                            representatives in certain of the other American republics had been
                            instructed to investigate reports that certain other governments were
                            agitating the possibility of such a protest.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the fact that he had already had a discussion
                            with you on this matter and that he was hoping to see you again on
                            Friday morning.<note n="19" xml:id="d321fn1">October 10.</note> He is
                            strongly impressed with the desirability of our Government’s accepting
                            the “guarantee” of the Chilean Government as a basis for the deletion of
                            certain firms from the Proclaimed List. I did not mention any individual
                            companies, although I asked him whether he had any in mind. Apparently
                            the “guarantee” of the Chilean Government would consist of a statement
                            to the effect that that Government, following careful investigation, was
                            convinced that a specified firm on the Proclaimed List was not engaged
                            and would not thereafter engage in activities inimical to the United
                            States. I did not express any view regarding this proposal, but we did
                            discuss the purposes and objectives of the Proclaimed List in general. I
                            said that of course both the Embassy in Santiago and the Department
                            would welcome information or suggestions from the Chilean Government
                            regarding individual cases.</p>
                        <p>It is the Ambassador’s opinion that the usefulness of the “guarantee”
                            plan would be to convert the Proclaimed List from a unilateral measure
                            on our part to a cooperative venture in which all the American republics
                            would participate. It is my view that we cannot accept the “guarantee”
                            plan in principle, but I hope that we will continue to give considerable
                            weight to expressions of official opinion regarding firms and
                            individuals carried on the Proclaimed List. There can be no question of
                            the value of the Proclaimed List as a measure of economic warfare; at
                            the same time, it is, in my opinion, unless very carefully handled, apt
                            to affect unfavorably the long-term development of our relations with
                            the other American republics.</p>

                                xml:id="d322fn2">Treasury Department.</note></p>
                        <p>They were given copies of a circular instruction to American
                            representatives in the other American Republics,<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d322fn3">Circular instruction of August 28, <ref
                                    target="#pg_271">p. 271</ref>.</note> covering certain
                            principles applicable to dealing with persons on the Proclaimed List.
                            Their attention was drawn particularly to the section on banking
                            facilities, and in addition they were informed that by a subsequent
                            circular telegram these instructions have been amended so as to cover
                            dealings by American banks with persons on the British Statutory List as
                            well as with persons on the American Proclaimed List. It was explained
                            that the British and Canadian Governments had already been consulted
                            with a view towards their issuing parallel instructions to branches or
                            agencies of British and Canadian banks in South America and that,
                            pursuant to the agreement of those Governments, parallel instructions
                            have been sent to be effective as of September 29, 1941.<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d322fn4">Note of September 25, from Mr. Hall of the British
                                Embassy, and note of September 29, from the Canadian Embassy;
                                neither printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that the attempt to restrict banking facilities
                            available to persons on the British Statutory List, or the American
                            Proclaimed List, would be more efficacious if the Netherlands Government
                            should issue parallel instructions to branches or agencies of Dutch
                            banks in South America.</p>
                        <p>Baron van Boetzelaer stated that the only Dutch bank in South America is
                            the Banco Holandéz Unido (which I understand has offices in Buenos
                            Aires, Caracas, Maracaibo, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and São Paulo and all
                            of which are generally licensed nationals under General License 19
                            issued under Executive Order). He stated that for some time this bank
                            has been following a policy of refusing all business with German
                            nationals in South America. There followed a discussion of the
                            differences between the British Statutory List and the Proclaimed List,
                            and also the Canadian List of Specified Persons. It was pointed out that
                            the British and Canadian Lists were substantially identical, but that
                            the American List was somewhat larger than the others. It was
                            emphasized, however, that so far as American, <pb n="298"
                                xml:id="pg_298" facs="0308"/>British and Canadian banks are
                            concerned, instructions had been issued covering dealings on the part of
                            such banks with persons on both the British and American Lists.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the Dutch Legation raised the question as to
                            whether banks in South America other than the American, British and
                            Canadian banks might be prevailed upon to take parallel action. They
                            referred specifically to the Banque Italo-Belge, and we replied that we
                            were planning in the immediate future to ask the Belgian Government to
                            take similar action with respect to this bank. We also stated that we
                            realized that adequate banking facilities might be made available to the
                            Proclaimed List nationals by local banks, but that it was hoped that
                            with the cooperation of the Governments concerned, local banks may
                            eventually be required to take parallel action.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the Dutch Legation appeared to be favorably
                            impressed by the proposal but stated that, of course, they would be
                            unable to take any steps in the matter without consulting with London.
                            There was handed to them a copy of a memorandum paraphrasing the
                            circular instructions sent out by the State Department in so far as
                            concerns the operations of American banks.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p>After the representatives of the Netherlands Legation had gone, Mr.
                                Timmons telephoned to Mr. Noel Hall and referred to Mr. Hall’s
                                letter to Mr. Acheson, dated September 30, 1941,<note n="23"
                                    xml:id="d322fn5">Not found in Department files.</note> in which
                                there was raised the question of asking the Banco Holandéz Unido and
                                the Belgian bank to take action similar to that taken by the
                                American, British and Canadian banks. Mr. Hall was informed of our
                                conference with the representatives of the Netherlands Government
                                and he stated that he would get in touch with them immediately and
                                furnish them with a copy of the instructions sent by the British
                                Government to the British banks; he also stated that he would cable
                                to London and ask the British Ministry of Economic Warfare to
                                approach the Dutch Government on this subject. Mr. Timmons said that
                                we were also planning to ask representatives of the Belgian Embassy
                                to come in to see us with respect to the Banque Italo-Belge and he
                                said that it might be advisable to have representatives of the
                                British Embassy come in; Mr. Hall agreed that this would be a
                                desirable procedure and it is hoped that it will be possible to have
                                such a conference tomorrow at which Mr. Stopford<note n="24"

                            European War 1939/966A, and file No. 740.00112A European War, 1939/1700A
                            concerning procedures and policies on maintenance of and application of
                            the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals.</p>
                        <p>As indicated by the instruction of August 28, 1941 the Proclaimed List
                            thus far has been restricted to concerns identified with pro-Axis
                            activities in the other American republics. The Department is now
                            considering the extension of the Proclaimed List to include business
                            firms in certain other neutral, non-belligerent or Axis-unoccupied
                            countries with a view to making the list as complete and effective as
                            possible from a world-wide point of view. Policy considerations may make
                            it inadvisable to extend the Proclaimed List to certain countries and
                            consideration is being given to controlling trade and financial
                            transactions in those areas by a confidential black list.</p>
                        <p>The present instruction is being sent to all field offices outside of the
                            other American republics, with a view to providing them with background
                            and reference material concerning the principles underlying and
                            objectives of the Proclaimed List. It is recognized that many aspects of
                            the problem in the other American republics as covered in the enclosed
                            instructions will not be relevant to other areas.</p>
                        <p>The Department is desirous of receiving from the Missions in those
                            countries outside of the Western Hemisphere to which the telegraphic
                            instructions under reference have been sent the names and addresses of
                            firms in the respective countries which, because of Axis nationality or
                            affiliations, Axis ideological outlook, or pro-Axis activities, would
                                <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0310"/>be considered undesirable
                            as trade or financial contacts for American business houses under
                            existing conditions and which, therefore, should properly be included in
                            the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals or in a confidential
                            black list. The lists of names of firms which the Missions receiving
                            specific telegraphic instructions will submit should contain all
                            available data for providing an accurate picture of the individual firm
                            reported upon and should indicate the specific reasons for which
                            inclusion of the firm in the Proclaimed List or in a confidential list
                            is considered desirable in the protection of American interests and
                            furtherance of this Government’s national defense policies.</p>
                        <p>In reporting names of firms recommended for the Proclaimed List, the
                            Mission should make special mention of any serious adverse effects upon
                            the national economy of the foreign country, or any serious political
                            consequences, which might result from the inclusion of specific firms in
                            the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>It is not desired that reporting Missions delay submitting names of firms
                            suitable for the Proclaimed List until complete lists of all known and
                            suspected Axis-affiliated concerns in the country can be submitted in
                            one report. Rather is it desired that names of firms be submitted in
                            groups as soon as possible following completion of the requisite field
                            investigations, the first group, relating to firms regarding which
                            information is most readily available, being followed by subsequent
                            contributions of groups of names from time to time, as circumstances may
                            permit.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that the work of preparing lists of firms intended for the
                            Proclaimed List be centralized in the Missions so far as possible, so
                            that it can be coordinated upon a uniform basis of maximum efficiency
                            for the entire country in question, the Missions calling upon consular
                            offices in outlying cities for cooperation in reporting upon firms in
                            their respective districts. It is also desired that reporting Missions
                            and consular offices consult local British authorities so that the
                            benefit of their views and information may be secured in connection with
                            the consideration of specific firms.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be pleased to receive constructive observations of
                            field officers assigned to the work of reporting upon pro-Axis firms
                            concerning the desirability and utility of extending the Proclaimed List
                            or a confidential black list to their territory, together with
                            recommendations concerning most advantageous methods by which the work
                            of reporting upon such undesirable firms might be most efficiently
                            developed.</p>

                        <p>1550. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me last night that he is
                            constantly receiving protests against the Proclaimed List and that
                            enemies of the United States and the Vargas Administration are saying
                            that “the Americans are interfering in the internal affairs of Brazil
                            and are trespassing on the rights of the Brazilian Government.”</p>
                        <p>The Minister strongly objects to the publication of the Proclaimed List
                            and says that although he has always refused to support proposals to
                            protest against the list (my telegram 1392, September 29, 10 p.m.<note
                                n="28" xml:id="d324fn1">Not printed.</note>), opposition is becoming
                            so strong that unless we discontinue the publication of it, the
                            Brazilian Government may be forced to express its disapproval. (I
                            believe Aranha is bluffing.)</p>
                        <p>I have pointed out to the Minister that the work we are doing is in the
                            interest of Brazil as well as of the United States and, although he
                            appreciates this point, he is disturbed over the number of protests he
                            is receiving, which he feels would be considerably reduced if we were to
                            cease publication of changes in the list.</p>
                        <p>The Minister again said “How can you expect us to acknowledge your list
                            when you do not blacklist undesirable firms in the United States?”</p>
                        <p>I repeat that I am endeavoring to pacify Aranha on this; but not with
                            much success thus far.</p>

                            suggested to them that it would be desirable for the Netherlands
                            Government to issue to the branches of the Banco Holandéz Unido in <pb
                                n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0312"/>South America instructions with
                            respect to dealings with persons on the Proclaimed and Statutory Lists,
                            similar to the instructions issued by the American, British and Canadian
                            Governments in September. Baron van Boetzelaer stated that he had now
                            heard from the Netherlands Government in London that the instructions
                            had already been issued to the Banco Holandéz Unido. They emphasized
                            that the issuance of the instructions amounted only to formalizing an
                            already existing situation, since all Netherland firms are advised by
                            the Netherlands Government to have no dealings with firms on either the
                            Proclaimed or Statutory List.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Miller referred to Baron van Boetzelaer’s inquiry at the previous
                            conference as to whether we were planning to request the Belgian banks
                            in South America to adopt a parallel program. Mr. Miller stated that
                            this question had been discussed with the British Embassy here and that
                            a conference is to be held tomorrow with Count de Gruben of the Belgian
                                Embassy<note n="29" xml:id="d325fn1">Baron Hervé de Gruben,
                                Counselor of Embassy.</note> to suggest that similar instructions be
                            issued by the Belgian Government. Mr. Miller pointed out, however, that
                            Belgian banks in South America, such as Banque Italo-Belge, are probably
                            cooperating already in this program on the basis of representation made
                            by the British Government. The representatives of the Netherlands
                            Government agreed that it would be in order for us to disclose to the
                            Belgians that the Netherlands Government has issued the instructions to
                            the Netherlands banks.</p>
                        <p>Count van Rechteren inquired whether any progress had been made towards
                            the end of having locally owned banks in South America cooperate in our
                            program. It was explained to him that this matter is still under
                            consideration, that we realize that adequate banking facilities will
                            continue to be available to persons on the Proclaimed List, even though
                            all Allied banks refuse to do business with such persons, but that the
                            adoption of the program by our Governments is a pre-requisite to making
                            any representations to the South American Governments along this line.
                            Mr. Timmons and Mr. Miller explained in general terms the success which
                            our Government has had in Haiti, Costa Rica, Guatemala and other
                            countries in obtaining cooperation from the local governments, and
                            stated that we would keep them informed as to further developments in
                            this field.</p>

                                printed; in this telegram the Ambassador summarized a recently
                                published Colombian Senate report which was extremely critical of
                                the objectives and preparation of the Proclaimed List. The Senate
                                Committee intended that the report should be transmitted to the
                                “Chancelleries of the American Republics”. (740.00112A European War,
                                1939/3616). A Senate resolution approved the report. In telegram No.
                                554, November 13, 11 p.m., from the Ambassador in Colombia (not
                                printed) he reported that (1) an interview with President Eduardo
                                Santos would have to await the latter’s return to the city on
                                November 17; (2) according to competent legal opinion the Senate
                                resolution was unconstitutional; (3) after consultation with some of
                                his diplomatic colleagues, he was inclined to agree with Foreign
                                Minister Luis Lopez de Mesa, who felt that the resolution would
                                receive only passing notice elsewhere (740.00112A European War,
                                1939/3709).</note> I am very disturbed by the action taken by the
                            Colombian Senate and believe it would be desirable for you to seek an
                            immediate interview with the President to discuss the matter.</p>
                        <p>At your interview with the President please tell him that the President
                            and I have always considered him as one of those who understood most
                            clearly the issues involved in the present struggle to resist the
                            ruthless spread of totalitarian aggression. Indeed, no greater support
                                <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0314"/>of inter-American
                            solidarity has been forthcoming from any country than that given by
                            Colombia during his administration.</p>
                        <p>It is precisely because of the President’s outstanding service in defense
                            of the ideals for which this hemisphere has stood that I take the
                            liberty of bringing to his attention the disruptive effects which
                            unquestionably will result if the report of the Colombian Senate is
                            submitted to the chancelleries of the other American republics. I hasten
                            to express this judgment to you without having taken the time to study
                            fully the reasons given in the report for the action taken and without
                            precise knowledge as to the discretion which the Executive may exercise
                            under the Colombian Constitution. It appears to me certain, however,
                            that the submission of this report adopted by the Senate of Colombia
                            will be accepted by the other American republics as the considered
                            judgment of the Colombian Government. If information available here is
                            correct, the Senate did not have the guidance or advice of the President
                            of Colombia nor did the President of Colombia attempt in any way to
                            influence the deliberations of the Senate. It therefore appears that the
                            report represents the views not of the Government but only of one house
                            of the Colombian Congress. In the second place, it is already obvious
                            that the totalitarian governments are going to employ the report as a
                            proof of their insistent view that the American republics are opposed to
                            the Proclaimed List established by this Government. Formal submission of
                            the report by the Colombian Government to the other American republics
                            will give additional ammunition to the Axis because the act of
                            submission will be made to appear as an endeavor on the part of the
                            Colombian Government to line up against this Government’s policy the
                            other American countries.</p>
                        <p>At this very critical juncture in the world crisis the unity of the
                            twenty-one American republics in opposing the ruthless aggression of the
                            totalitarian nations is indispensable to the very safety and security of
                            each one of the other American republics. The totalitarian forces are
                            working day and night attempting to find a crack in the structure of
                            inter-American solidarity. It would, therefore, be most unfortunate were
                            an opening gratuitously to be afforded to those who would like to
                            destroy us.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, very earnestly hoped that the President will find it
                            possible within his constitutional powers to withhold circulation of the
                            report to the other American countries.</p>
                        <p>The adoption of this report by the Colombian Senate has come as an abrupt
                            surprise to the Department, which, although aware of the views of
                            certain Senators, did not think they were shared by the majority of the
                            Senate. As you know, the Interdepartmental Committee, which handles
                            Proclaimed List matters, has always been ready <pb n="305"
                                xml:id="pg_305" facs="0315"/>to consider any objections which the
                            Colombian Government might have had to the Proclaimed List.</p>

                                        take place until Friday, November 21, when, as he reported
                                        in telegram No. 573, November 21, 7 p.m., (not printed), he
                                        reiterated the views expressed herein. President Santos
                                        replied that (1) under no circumstances would he permit the
                                        Senate report to be circulated to other American
                                        Governments; (2) he would instruct the Foreign Ministry to
                                        announce that constitutionally only the President had the
                                        right to communicate with other nations; hence, the
                                        concluding paragraph of the Senate report was ineffective.

                            important factors in the defense program, at this time Proclaimed List
                            was one of the most effective actions taken especially in combatting the
                            strongly organized fifth column which we had in all of our countries. It
                            was precisely neglect of details in the face of well-known German
                            efficiency that had led to the downfall of one country after another,
                            and in the face of the totalitarian menace to our very existence we
                            could not neglect the slightest possibility of danger.</p>
                        <p>At one point in the conversation the Minister expressed the hope we might
                            at least consult the Ministry on a few Proclaimed List cases. I observed
                            that we had consulted with the Foreign Office committee on cases and
                            pointed out that of 349 names listed there had been comment made by
                            either the executive or legislative branches of the Colombian Government
                            in only one instance where the accuracy of our information had not been
                            questioned. Moreover, some Colombian firms obtained the business lost by
                            the totalitarian. I emphasized our continued cooperation with Colombia
                            in many different ways which involved substantial sacrifices by us and
                            that it was [not?] for us to make such sacrifices in benefit of those
                            whom we believe to be directly or indirectly dangerous to the defense of
                            the United States or the hemisphere.<note n="39" xml:id="d328fn5">Part

                        <p>I said the Senate report quoted only those parts of Habana agreement to
                            Uruguay [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] which provided for consultation and
                            it omitted any reference to the obligations of each American Government
                            to adopt all necessary measures within its territory and to eradicate
                            the spread of totalitarian fundamentals. We had promulgated Proclaimed
                            List strictly in compliance with these latter obligations.</p>

                            have been issued to branches of the Banque Italo-Belge in Brazil,
                            Uruguay and Argentina requiring these branches to conform with the
                            course of conduct set forth in paragraph number 2 of Department’s
                            circular instruction September 20 and in circular telegrams of September
                            22 and 26. The instructions of the Belgian Government require the
                            branches of the Banque Italo-Belge to have no dealings with individuals
                            or firms who are mentioned on the Proclaimed List, as well as those
                            which appear on the British Statutory List. The Belgian Embassy has
                            suggested that the chiefs of Belgian missions in Brazil, Uruguay and
                            Argentina keep in close contact with the American and British missions

                            this field and obtain from it information and submit periodic reports to

                            Certain Blocked Nationals”, File No. 740.00112A European War
                            1939/966A.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a copy of a confidential list of unsatisfactory
                                consignees<note n="41" xml:id="d330fn1">Not printed.</note> which
                            has been prepared and used by the Office of Export Control in passing on
                            license applications. To date the Department <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"
                                facs="0318"/>has had nothing to do with the preparation of the
                            confidential list. Recently the Department concluded arrangements with
                            the Economic Defense Board, which now administers Export Control, to
                            have the maintenance of the confidential list handled by the Department.
                            The list is to be revised by the Department on the basis of the
                            information contained in the Department’s files and on the basis of your
                            recommendations. The Export Control authorities have informed the
                            Department that the list is mainly composed of individuals who have been
                            reported as being associated in one way or another with firms on the
                            Proclaimed List or with other firms which the Export Control authorities
                            have considered to be unsatisfactory consignees. The primary purpose of
                            the confidential list as presently constituted has been to prevent
                            “cloaking” activities by such individuals on behalf of the firms with
                            which they are identified. On the other hand there are a considerable
                            number of firms on this list which have not yet been considered for the
                            Proclaimed List and the individuals associated with such firms are also
                            included.</p>
                        <p>The Department is now engaged in checking the list against its files in
                            order to identify all cases which have an “A” rating in the Department’s
                            records on the basis of unfavorable information in the Department’s
                            possession, but which are not yet included on the Proclaimed List. As
                            soon as these “A” cases have been identified the Export Control
                            authorities will recheck the list to indicate each name which is
                            associated with either a Proclaimed List firm or with the “A” cases and
                            a revised confidential list will then be put into effect which will
                            contain only the “A” cases and the names of persons who, according to
                            Export Control’s records, are identified with either an “A” firm or a
                            Proclaimed List firm. All other names now on the list will be eliminated
                            pending receipt of a report based upon your review of the list.</p>
                        <p>It is contemplated that the “A” cases referred to above will be reviewed
                            as rapidly as possible with a view to proposing most cases for inclusion
                            on the Proclaimed List. In the future the confidential list will be
                            confined in the main to three types of cases: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Individuals who are identified with Proclaimed List firms
                                    either as owners, partners, directors, stockholders, employees,
                                    et cetera, but who have not been recommended for individual
                                    listing on the Proclaimed List. Experience has shown that such
                                    persons frequently are utilized as “cloaks”, but it is not
                                    desirable to include many such individuals on the Proclaimed
                                    List until their status as an actual cloak is
                                    established.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>

                                    Proclaimed List in a short time, but which can be put under
                                    immediate control by including the name on the confidential
                                    list.</item>
                                <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0319"/>

                                <item>Persons and firms who would be included on the Proclaimed List
                                    except for special considerations, i.e., the “A–S” cases.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Department recognizes the many difficulties inherent in the
                            maintenance and operation of a confidential list, but for the present at
                            least it appears necessary to maintain such a list as a complementary
                            control to the Proclaimed List. The confidential list will be kept as
                            small and as flexible in operation as is feasible. Cases should not
                            generally be recommended for the confidential list merely because the
                            evidence is not strong enough to warrant inclusion on the Proclaimed
                            List, except in the case of firms or individuals who are associated with
                            Proclaimed List firms in which event they should be automatically
                            recommended for the confidential list. The mission should exercise its
                            discretion in determining when circumstances make it advisable to
                            recommend such individuals for the Proclaimed List rather than the
                            confidential list. Whenever the activities of particular individuals are
                            responsible for a firm being placed on the Proclaimed List such
                            individuals should generally be recommended for the Proclaimed List
                            along with the firm. Even in such cases, however, there may be special
                            circumstances which make it preferable to recommend the individual for
                            the confidential list rather than the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing the enclosed list it is requested that the mission report as
                            soon as possible on all cases which: (1) should <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> be included on either the confidential or the Proclaimed
                            List; (2) should be considered for inclusion on the Proclaimed List. <hi
                                rend="italic">In both cases the essential facts should be furnished
                                or reference made to prior reports covering the case</hi>. Whenever
                            a case should be considered for the confidential list because of special
                            circumstances, these circumstances should be stated and an “A–S” rating
                            recommended.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that many of the names relate to obscure individuals
                            whom it may be difficult to identify and your report on such cases may
                            be postponed until you receive a copy of the revised confidential list.
                            At that time it will probably be desirable to recheck many of the cases
                            to determine whether the individual is still associated with the firm
                            which resulted in the inclusion of his name.</p>
                        <p>Copies of this instruction are being forwarded directly to the missions
                            for distribution to the consulates with such further instructions as the
                            missions deem advisable. In this connection it is assumed that the
                            missions will furnish the consulates with such portions of the list as
                            are applicable to the different consular districts. The reports of the
                            consulates on this matter should, as on other Proclaimed List matters,
                            be made through the mission. The Department will endeavor in the future
                            to forward to the mission and the consulates at regular intervals
                            subsequent revisions of the confidential list. Although the existence of
                            a so-called “gray list” or confidential list has been referred <pb
                                n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0320"/>to in the press and elsewhere
                            the Department desires that the existence of the list and the nature of
                            its operation be treated as confidential.</p>

                            Confidential circular instruction entitled “Procedures and Policies on
                            Maintenance of the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals”, file
                            no. 740.00112A European War 1939/966A, of August 28, 1941.</p>
                        <p>During the past three months the Department has continued a close
                            exchange of views and information with the British Embassy and Canadian
                            Legation in Washington with a view to bringing the maintenance and
                            operation of the Proclaimed List, the British Statutory List and the
                            Canadian List of Specified Persons into the most effective harmony.
                            Section V of the circular instruction of August 28, 1941 indicated that
                            the Department desired our missions to maintain close contact with the
                            British missions for the full and free exchange of information on these
                            matters and our missions were requested to indicate what action the
                            British mission had taken or proposed to take on all cases proposed for
                            addition to or deletion from the Proclaimed List. The Department now
                            desires to reemphasize the necessity for this being done by all the
                            missions in order that the two lists may be speedily brought into more
                            effective harmony.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy here has informed the Department that the Ministry of
                            Economic Warfare in London now proposes to add to the British Statutory
                            List all cases appearing on the Proclaimed List and any subsequent
                            additions to the Proclaimed List without waiting for a full presentation
                            of the information which resulted in these cases being placed on the
                            Proclaimed List. The Department and the Interdepartmental Committee on
                            the Proclaimed List are not at present prepared to follow a similar
                            policy of automatically including all Statutory List cases on the
                            Proclaimed List, but we desire to achieve the same result wherever such
                            action would be in line with our basic listing policies as set forth in
                            the circular instruction of August 28, 1941. Since the basic British and
                            American listing policies are now closely in harmony it is believed that
                            this result can be reached if our exchanges of information and views on
                            individual cases <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0321"/>are further
                            developed in the field and in Washington. To this end you are

                                    exchanges should, of course, be arranged on a reciprocal basis
                                    and you should forward to the Department full information on all
                                    cases which the British may subsequently propose for addition or

                        <p>It is believed that cooperation in the field along the foregoing lines
                            and within the limitations stated in the circular instruction of August
                            28, 1941 will make both the Proclaimed List and the Statutory List more
                            effective and avoid for the most part the problems created for both when
                            divergent action is taken in Washington and London on these matters.
                            This cooperation does not, however, contemplate that our actions will be
                            simultaneous or that they will necessarily be identical in all cases,
                            but it is designed to reduce the divergencies between the lists so far
                            as is compatible with our respective interests and independent
                            judgments.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Economic Warfare in London has arranged to have a
                            representative from the American Embassy in London sit in as an observer
                            at meetings of the Black List Committee. This observer will be kept
                            generally informed of our policies and procedures, and he will keep the
                            Department informed on important developments in London. However, it is
                            considered essential by the British and Canadian Governments and
                            ourselves that in the interest of efficient operation the exchanges on
                            particular cases should take place primarily between the respective
                            missions in the first place and in the second place between the
                            Department and the British and Canadian authorities in Washington.
                            Accordingly, the Department will continue to keep the British Embassy
                            and Canadian Legation here closely informed of all cases which are being
                            considered for addition or deletion and we will make available to them
                            the pertinent information on such cases.</p>

                        <p>The British authorities have expressed the hope that this Government
                            would be prepared to act favorably on removing cases from the Proclaimed
                            List where the British have accepted undertakings from the firm with a
                            view to delisting the firm from the Statutory List. The Department and
                            the Interdepartmental Committee feel that no general position can be
                            taken on this question at this time, but that it is merely one aspect of
                            the general problem of developing closer collaboration in the field and
                            here. Accordingly, you should keep your British colleague closely
                            informed on any assurances or undertakings which we are considering and
                            request him to keep you similarly informed in order that the Department
                            and London may be fully informed of any divergencies of views on

                            reviewed at meetings last week by my staff with consular officers from
                            Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Bahia and Pernambuco.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the principal obstacle to attaining the purposes <pb
                                n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0323"/>for which the Proclaimed List
                            was promulgated is the impossibility, under existing controls, of
                            preventing cloaking operations of listed firms. It was brought out that
                            some German firms here have organized cloaking systems in order to
                            enable them to accumulate stocks of American products before the
                            adoption of an all-inclusive export control system by the United States
                            which they believe is inevitable.</p>
                        <p>These firms switch from one cloak to another faster than our system
                            permits us to list those whose operations have been sufficiently well
                            established to warrant our recommendations for listing (see São Paulo
                            despatch 295 of October 30 [<hi rend="italic">31</hi>], 1941<note
                                n="43a" xml:id="d333fn2">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Embassy and Consulate are not in a position effectively
                            to permit [<hi rend="italic">prevent?</hi>] cloaking operations, the
                            Consuls have made the following recommendations which I endorse: (1)
                            That all exports from the United States to Brazil be subject to export
                            license; (2) that the Embassy be consulted by telegraph concerning
                            prospective consignees on whom favorable information is not available in
                            Washington. It is recognized that this will require revision of some
                            World Trade Directory reports and compilation of a so-called
                            confidential “white list”. However, in view of the need for or in order
                            to eliminate cloaks it is suggested that the plan be put into operation
                            at once; (3) that the Proclaimed List be maintained. (The suggested
                            procedure for Brazil is all the more important now that the Brazilian
                            Government prohibits the publication of the Proclaimed List.)</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Brazilian Government would not object to the export
                            license procedure if applied uniformly in the Americas because it would
                            have the advantage of enabling consuming interests here to obtain
                            requirements through legitimate rather than speculative channels thus
                            eliminating profiteering in non-licensed American exports.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I regard this as an important step towards preventing listed firms from
                            obtaining supplies in the United States.</p>

                            the issuance of a Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals it became
                            apparent that a rigid application of the proclamation with respect to

                            would have resulted in serious dislocations of the national economies of
                            such <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0324"/>countries. In order to

                            with this end in view. Under these plans controls have been imposed by
                            the local governments on the activities of certain Proclaimed List
                            nationals located in these countries. The products of firms on the

                            exports from the United States for such firms are permitted under

                        <p>At a meeting held in Mr. Acheson’s office Thursday, December 11, attended
                            by representatives of the European Division, the Near Eastern Division
                            and the Division of World Trade Intelligence, it was decided—subject to
                            your approval—that the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals
                            should be immediately extended to include all firms and persons
                            appearing on the British Statutory List for Sweden, Switzerland, Spain
                            (and possessions), Portugal (and possessions), and Turkey.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Considerations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is believed that the principal advantages of so extending the
                            Proclaimed List are political. In view of the state of war which now
                            exists between the United States and Germany and Italy it seems
                            desirable that this Government should appear to the remaining neutral
                            countries to be acting in complete concert with Great Britain. It is
                            believed that under the circumstances the neutral countries concerned as
                            well as the people of the United States would expect such action to be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>In view of existing controls and current conditions it is not probable
                            that so extending our Proclaimed List would have any great effect over
                            the movement of trade. Although it is possible that the existing
                            controls would be perfected somewhat it is probable that this action
                            would, however, have more direct effect in controlling financial
                            transactions. It is impossible to state precisely how great this
                            advantage would be but the British Embassy has informed us that the
                            Ministry of Economic Warfare considers that the advantage would be a
                            very material one and of considerable assistance to them.</p>
                        <p>The extension of our list to other countries outside this hemisphere
                            would probably be well received in the other American republics and <pb
                                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0326"/>would eliminate the present
                            appearance of discriminating against these republics in confining our
                            Proclaimed List to this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>If our list is to be extended to these European countries, it is
                            desirable for political considerations that there should be no
                            divergence between our list and the British Statutory List. Any such
                            divergence would be capitalized by the Germans and Italians. As a
                            practical matter, if we are to act swiftly, it is necessary to adopt the
                            cases on the British List since existing difficulties in communication
                            make it impossible for us to secure rapid and full reports on these
                            matters. Our missions have been under instructions since July 24 to
                            forward information concerning firms which might be considered for the
                            Proclaimed List and they have been instructed to exchange information
                            with their British colleagues to this end. However, we do not, as yet,
                            have adequate reports for the independent preparation of the list from
                            several of the countries.</p>
                        <p>Since the British have been primarily concerned with the problem of
                            maintaining satisfactory relations with these countries while engaged in
                            waging war with the Axis, it seems logical and wise to follow their lead
                            in any listing policies which we might adopt with respect to these
                            countries. It is believed that any differences on particular cases in
                            the future can be worked out satisfactorily between our respective
                            missions and through the presence of our observer on the Black List
                            Committee in London. In turn, it may be expected, as has been the case,
                            that the British will more and more follow our lead on cases in this
                            hemisphere and that Washington will be the coordination center for
                            hemisphere listing policies. We would, of course, retain full freedom of
                            action to delete or not to add any European cases on which there was
                            disagreement.</p>

                        <p>It would not be practicable or advisable to extend our list in Sweden to
                            cover all pro-Axis firms or firms of Swedish nationality which maintain
                            trading relations with the Axis. The British have a comparatively small
                            list for Sweden and they have stated that for the most part they have
                            followed a policy of confining their list in Sweden to Axis-owned or
                            Axis-controlled firms. Our mission has indicated that the British list
                            has been prepared with at least the tacit approval of the Swedish
                            Government. Our mission has previously expressed the view that it would
                            be better not to have a Proclaimed List for Sweden. Telegram no. 822 of

                            from the mission (apparently prepared before the state of war was known)
                            states that the <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0327"/>British list
                            contains firms of Swedish ownership; that a certain amount of good-will
                            would be lost in having a Proclaimed List for Sweden and that the only
                            advantages would be coordination with the British and some assistance in
                            administering the navicert system. The mission felt that a Proclaimed
                            List might in the light of our financial and commercial arrangements
                            with Sweden be interpreted by the Swedish authorities as an indication
                            of lack of confidence in them and their undertakings not to permit the
                            reexport of United States imports. The mission further indicated that
                            the British may extend their list in Sweden. In the light of the state
                            of war which now exists it is not believed that these factors ought to
                            be determinative. If we are to extend the list to Europe it ought to
                            cover all neutral countries without discrimination. The British listing
                            policy is keyed to their war interests, which are now ours, and if a
                            United States list is to be extended to Sweden the British list ought to
                            be used.</p>

                        <p>The British have informed us that their listing policy in Switzerland has
                            also been based primarily on enemy ownership or control but they have
                            probably gone somewhat further here than in Sweden. The control of
                            financial transactions is probably more important in the case of
                            Switzerland than elsewhere. Our mission has not indicated any specific
                            views either for or against the extension of our list to Switzerland. It
                            is to be noted that this Government has requested Switzerland to
                            represent our interests in Axis countries.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The British have a comparatively long list for Spain and although enemy
                            ownership or control has been the primary basis for listing firms here
                            again the listing policy has gone further than in the case of Sweden.
                            Our Embassy has made a careful investigation of the British Statutory
                            List cases for Spain and has recommended that our Proclaimed List be
                            extended to Spain and include some 350 cases contained on the British
                            list. The Embassy suggested that some twenty cases on the British list
                            might be kept on our confidential list pending further checking.
                            However, it does not appear that under existing conditions there would
                            be any objections to including these cases on the Proclaimed List. Our
                            Embassy has recommended the inclusion of more than 100 additional cases
                            which are not presently on the British Statutory List. It is not
                            believed that the British have consulted the Spanish Government very
                            closely with respect to their listing policies but no particular
                            political disadvantages are seen in extending our list to Spain by
                            including all cases now on the Statutory List.</p>

                        <p>The British listing policy in Portugal has been somewhat more restricted
                            than in the case of Spain due to special considerations. No particular
                            political disadvantages are perceived in extending our list at this time
                            to Portugal on the basis of the firms included in the British list. Our
                            mission has not as yet indicated any position on the question. The
                            American Consul in Portuguese East Africa has recommended that our list

                        <p>It is to be noted that the British have used a confidential Black List

                            British will not list Turkish-controlled firms merely because they are
                            exporting to the Axis indigenous products in return for goods essential

                        <p>2119. For the Under Secretary. Aranha made it abundantly clear to me
                            yesterday, and desires me to make it clear to you, that we cannot expect
                            his enthusiastic cooperation with us to continue unless different
                            methods are adopted in connection with the Proclaimed List. He says all
                            the blame all over Brazil is being placed on his shoulders and that it
                            is weakening his position more than he can stand.</p>
                        <p>As I have stated before the Proclaimed List ends can be substantially met
                            and we can do away with Aranha’s objections if the Department will adopt

                            favorable to the Department’s proposals regarding procedure harmonizing
                            Proclaimed and Statutory Lists for European countries. We tentatively
                            explored certain details of required mechanics but felt number of points
                            would have to be dealt with as they arose.</p>
                        <p>We agreed, subject to the Department’s approval, that recommendations to
                            list or delete would continue to come from British missions to Ministry
                            of Economic Warfare through established channels but that henceforth
                            they would invariably include definite statements regarding American
                            missions’ concurrence or disagreement. In latter case (only) would
                            American missions telegraph Embassy at London their opinions. Embassy
                            observers at Blacklist Committee meetings would have access to files
                            including corporations and recommend to Department either concurrence
                            British missions position or maintenance stand taken by American
                            missions unless of course Department desires such cases settled here
                            when practicable. We believe there will be very few cases in which
                            attitudes of British and American missions will not be reconciled in the
                            field.</p>
                        <p>Question arose what the American equivalent of Black as differentiated
                            from Statutory List would be particularly in cases where recommendations
                            specified the former. Will the Department please telegraph attitude this
                                point.<note n="53" xml:id="d339fn1">In telegram No. 75, January 7,

                            with Consul General Stewart they concurred with proposal to extend list
                            “if it is also extended to all other countries named”, i.e. the other
                            four European neutrals. Legation assumed Minister Harrison consulted;
                            Mr. Acheson has done so.</p>

                                xml:id="d340fn8">Not printed.</note> stated it perceived no
                            objection to extending list to include enemy firms in Turkey, but
                            thought it inadvisable to include Turkish firms. The Embassy stated
                            inclusion of Turkish firms on British list caused resentment in Turkey
                            and eventually resulted in arrangement whereby “most of the Turkish
                            firms were deleted” from British list in return for Turkish Government
                            giving certain undertakings. Our list will, <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322"
                                facs="0332"/>of course, reflect all the deletions already made or
                            proposed to be made by the British, but beyond this it would not be
                            feasible for us presently to single out Turkish firms for deletion and
                            it is assumed that our mission recognizes this and the advisability of
                            our lists being parallel.</p>
                        <p>WT is now completing the work of preparing the revised British list for
                            publication in the Proclaimed List for these countries and their

                            the decision to go ahead with the publication as soon as possible. A

                        <p>476. The Department has consulted the War and Navy Departments in regard
                            to the resumption in Washington of the staff conversations with
                            Argentina. The Navy expresses its approval. The War Department states
                            that, owing to the Navy’s preference for Washington, it is willing to
                            concur. Both Departments emphasize that the Argentine military and naval
                            representatives should possess sufficient authority to reach military
                            agreements without being compelled to consult their Government about
                            details.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that on June 24 the Air Attaché of the Argentine Embassy
                            presented to the Department a list of raw materials and aeronautical
                            equipment and stated that two other lists would follow. Under existing
                            conditions, the Lend-Lease Act<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn1">Approved
                                March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note> provides the only possibility
                            available to Argentina of obtaining any early delivery on military and
                            naval material. In view of the foregoing, the Department is of the
                            opinion that it would be mutually advantageous if these representatives
                            could be authorized to negotiate at the same time for the acquisition of
                            armament under the Lend-Lease Act. (See Department’s circular telegram
                            May 20, 10 p.m.)<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn2"><hi rend="italic"

                        <p>You are therefore requested to approach the Argentine Government in order
                            to obtain an expression of its views on this proposal. You may state
                            that is it the understanding of this Government that the Argentine
                            Government is disposed to renew staff conversations and that it would be
                            happy if the Argentine authorities would concur in <pb n="324"

                                xml:id="d342fn1">Not printed.</note> referred to in the last
                            paragraph of the Department’s 476 of July 25, 7 p.m., since Espil<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d342fn2">Felipe A. Espil, Argentine Ambassador in the
                                United States.</note> stated he would not like to transmit it to his
                            Government. His explanation was that he was certain that the Argentine
                            Government would jump to the conclusion that the obtaining of military
                            and naval equipment was contingent upon an outcome satisfactory to the
                            United States of the staff conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was unequivocally informed that the discussions re
                            acquisition of matériel under the Lend-Lease Act and the staff
                            conversations were not linked together, but parallel negotiations that
                            might best take place simultaneously. The suggestion that the same
                            officers who were coming to Washington to carry on the detailed
                            discussions for the acquisition of matériel under the Lend-Lease Act
                            also engage in staff conversations arose from the view that this was a
                            practical procedure that would advance both questions rapidly.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of corroboratory information from you, the Department
                            wonders whether Espil has accurately reflected the view the Argentine
                            Government would have taken in this matter had it been consulted by him.
                            However, if you have found that the Argentine Government is of the
                            opinion that holding staff conversations in Washington coincidentally
                            with negotiations for matériel would make it appear that Argentina was
                            undertaking “political commitments” in connection with its purchase of
                            military and naval equipment, you may advise the Argentine Government
                            that this Government would be disposed to renew the staff conversations
                            in Buenos Aires instead of in Washington, if that should be the desire
                            of the Argentine Government. It is of course highly important that the
                            staff conversations should be renewed as soon as practicable.</p>

                        <p>In a recent conversation with the Acting President the question came up
                            and Dr. Castillo, who showed that he was familiar with our memorandum,
                            expressed general approval of the idea which he said was still being
                            studied.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the Department’s telegram and the Embassy’s memorandum based
                            on it made it abundantly clear that the obtaining of military and naval
                            equipment is in no way contingent on the outcome of staff conversations
                            and that the suggestion for the appointment of a commission to deal with
                            these two matters was based on the practical advantage of having both
                            questions dealt with as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>However, should the Government here raise the question or appear to have
                            any doubts I shall follow the line suggested in the last paragraph of
                            the Department’s telegram in the meantime continuing to stress the
                            importance of having staff conversations renewed as soon as
                            practicable.</p>

                            told me last night that after further consultation with the Ministers of
                            War and Marine it has now [been?] decided to send <pb n="326"
                                xml:id="pg_326" facs="0336"/>a commission to the United States with
                            authority to hold staff talks as well as to present the Government’s
                            requirements for defense along the lines of our Government’s proposal
                            submitted in my memorandum to him. The Minister appreciates our
                            Government’s position that in making our proposal we had no intention of
                            linking the two subjects or making one contingent upon the other but he
                            feels that from the staff conversations which could take place first
                            would logically emerge in clearer form Argentina’s requirements for
                            defense material. It was his understanding that the staff talks would be
                            kept within the general framework of the continental defense plans as
                            envisaged in the Panama and Habana Conferences.<note n="10"

                        <p>It is my understanding that the commission will shortly be formed and be
                            prepared to leave within the near future. The Minister hopes that the
                            commission’s stay in the United States would not have to be prolonged,
                            intimating that it would be difficult for certain of the officers,
                            presumably of high rank, to be absent too long from their work here. In
                            this connection the Department may want to consider discussing
                            arrangements for a special plane to be placed at their disposal in the
                            event that they fly up as I understand is now planned.</p>
                        <p>In view of the position taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his
                            earlier talks with me that staff conversations involved political
                            questions which would require the intervention of the Argentine
                            Ambassador in Washington, it may be that the Department will wish to
                            suggest that Espil attend the staff conversations if he wishes to do so.
                            In that event, presumably some representative of the State Department
                            could also be present.</p>
                        <p>I was very much encouraged by the Minister’s general attitude and feel
                            that the decision is to be interpreted as further evidence of the new
                            change in spirit on the part of the Government in the direction of
                            closer cooperation, which is daily becoming more apparent in all circles
                            here.</p>

                            states that he is holding conversations with the Ministers of War and

                            476, July 25, 7 p.m., will take. He seems to understand from Espil that
                            some kind of general form agreement has been drawn up: in any event he
                            presumes that our staff conversations and agreements resulting there
                            from, with other countries within framework of continental defense
                            program would probably enable us to give them an idea what form our
                            agreement with them would take. In the meantime I am giving the Minister
                            the Spanish text of the basic agreement (revised) Department’s circular
                            instructions of July 26<note n="14" xml:id="d345fn4">Not printed; for

                            the form agreement which he has in mind although this deals primarily

                            agreement, of which I understand from Department’s telegram No. 617,

                        <p>701. Your 962, September 13, 1 p.m. Department consulted War and Navy
                            Departments on the subjects to be discussed at contemplated staff
                            conversations to be held in Washington. The latter have transmitted to
                            Department the following proposed agenda.</p>
                        <p>An endeavor should be made to reach an agreement on the action each would
                            take under the following conditions: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in the
                            event that the United States and Argentina should be associates in a war
                            against <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0338"/>the same enemy, and
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) in the event that one country should
                            remain a non-belligerent and the other should engage in war.</p>
                        <p>Under the first alternative mentioned above, the purpose would be (1) to
                            decide upon the best methods of cooperation between the armed forces of
                            Argentina and the United States; (2) to coordinate plans for such
                            cooperation; (3) to reach agreements concerning the nature and methods
                            of military cooperation between the two nations which would comprise the
                            allocation of existing areas of responsibility, the principal lines of
                            military strategy which both countries should adopt, and the strength of
                            the armed forces which each nation may be able to supply. In addition,
                            it would be necessary to determine suitable command arrangements, both
                            as to the unity of command in the field and supreme military control in
                            the event of joint operations either tactical or strategical.</p>
                        <p>The object of the second alternative would be to decide what action for
                            the defense of the hemisphere each country might take within the limits
                            of its own policy. This discussion would involve such a question as
                            action with reference to sea and air patrols to protect legitimate
                            commerce in the South Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>The text of the former staff conversations should be examined and
                            modified as far as may be necessary to include the foregoing program.
                            The contemplated agreement would be broader in scope than the one which
                            would have been concluded had the earlier conversations been successful.
                            In addition, it is believed that the representatives, both military and
                            naval of both countries, should be officers with sufficient authority,
                            experience and rank to set forth the point of view of their respective
                            branch of the armed forces, and make decisions of a military
                            character.</p>
                        <p>Any agreements which these officers may reach will be subject of course
                            to confirmation by the governments of each republic and by the chiefs of
                            staff of their respective military and naval forces.</p>
                        <p>The basic agreement to which you refer in your telegram 962 relates to
                            the acquisition of military equipment and not to the subject of
                            cooperation between the military forces of both countries.</p>

                            telegram 701, September 26, 5 p.m., regarding Argentine Military Naval
                            Mission to the United States, the Minister <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329"
                                facs="0339"/>for Foreign Affairs has informed me that a very
                            important and far reaching plan of defense for Argentina has been drawn
                            up and will be considered at the next Cabinet meeting on October 22. He
                            explained confidentially that the plan concentrates largely on naval
                            defense, 80% being devoted to this aspect and not more than 20% to the
                            military aspect. It covers the whole of Argentina’s coast line from
                            Uruguay to Cape Horn and envisages difficult position with Chile in the
                            Straits and Brazil to the north. If the plan is approved by the
                            Government, they hope that Admiral Stark<note n="19" xml:id="d347fn2"
                                >Adm. Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations.</note> and the
                            high staff officers of our Navy and Army will be willing to discuss it
                            with the Mission which will go up, and offer any suggestions regarding
                            it. It will be on the basis of this plan that their purchasing program
                            will be drawn up.</p>
                        <p>The Minister is still unable to give me the names of the officers who
                            will be chosen although the names of Rear Admiral Sabá Sueyro and

                            view to reducing them to and keeping them at not more than one month’s
                            supply, in order that when the time is ripe we may dry up these
                            carriers’ supplies.</p>
                        <p>Standard Oil is ready to refuse the present Lati request, but it has been
                            observed that the Argentine Government may purchase aviation gasoline
                            from Standard for delivery to Lati.</p>
                        <p>The Department is informing the Standard Oil that it expects from the
                            company the continuation of the latter’s cooperation in this respect,

                        <p>778. Department’s telegram No. 487, July 29, 9 p.m. Intava (local
                            marketing agency for Standard Oil aviation products) says it recently
                            advised Lati that it could no longer supply it with aviation gasoline in
                            Argentine. Intava also advised local Condor agency that any Intava
                            gasoline supplied by Condor to Lati in Argentine would be deducted from
                            monthly quantity normally supplied to Condor.</p>
                        <p>Intava doubts if Argentine Government will endeavor to purchase for Lati
                            but if so Intava will plead inability to supply due to scarcity of
                            stocks. Intava will advise Embassy of any such Argentine request or any
                            other pertinent developments.</p>
                        <p>Matter has also been discussed with Ultramar, which advises that Intava
                            is handling such matters for it. Both Intava and Ultramar seem disposed
                            to cooperate fully.</p>

                        <p>788. Department’s 491. With regard to additional Condor service as
                            mentioned in Embassy’s telegram No. 756, July 23, 5 p.m., Condor <pb
                                n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0349"/>informed Intava that such
                            service was intended as extension of new Lati service to Buenos Aires.
                            Intava understands that this second Condor service to Santiago will be
                            suspended if Lati is forced to suspend service to Buenos Aires which
                            appears likely if gasoline can be withheld locally.</p>
                        <p>With regard to probable reconnaissance flights by Condor between Brazil
                            and Argentina as mentioned in Embassy’s telegram No. 763, July 24, 6
                                p.m.,<note n="37" xml:id="d359fn1">Not printed.</note> the Condor
                            plane from Brazil on July 27 was 2 hours late in arriving in Buenos
                            Aires where it was met by German Ambassador under suspicious
                            circumstances. It seems possible that plane was endeavoring to observe
                            British auxiliary cruiser <hi rend="italic">Puocantara</hi> which
                            arrived in Buenos Aires yesterday. It is suggested that one way of
                            restricting these reconnaissance flights would be through British
                            protests to the Argentine and Brazilian Governments which in turn could
                            assign observers and impose penalties on Condor for unexplained
                            delays.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in Embassy’s telegram No. 778, July 30, 6 p.m., the
                            situation concerning aviation, large proportion in Argentina is fairly
                            well under control considering that Condor is not given more than 1
                            month’s supply and Lati is now being refused altogether. With regard to
                            complete stoppage of local Intava sales to Condor, Intava says that
                            Standard Oil of Brazil has a contract expiring March 1942 to supply
                            Condor in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and that any attempt to cut off
                            Condor entirely might have complications in Brazil. At the same time
                            Intava admit that the key to the whole problem is in Brazil which is
                            more dependent on imports for its petroleum supplies.</p>
                        <p>Y.P.F. in Argentina apparently can spare No. 87 octane gasoline to any
                            commercial airline. However it is questionable whether Argentina would
                            look with favor upon Intava’s refusal to sell any gasoline to Condor in
                            this country, and in such event Y.P.F. might endeavor to supply Condor
                            with 73 or 80 octane grades. I understand that there is still some
                            mystery as to the existence of the alleged chemical tablets used by the
                            Germans to improve octane rating of lower grade gasoline.</p>
                        <p>Intava estimates that Lati has sufficient gasoline in Brazil to operate
                            for 2 to 3 months.</p>

                            a telegram dated July 23, 1941 from the American Embassy at Buenos Aires
                            that commencing on July 24, 1941 the Condor air line would according to
                            an announcement in the local press, institute a second weekly service
                            between Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, with westbound
                            trips on Mondays and Thursdays and eastbound trips on Wednesdays and
                            Saturdays and including on all trips a stop at Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
                        <p>In furtherance of the general program for bringing about the removal of
                            Axis influence or control over aviation in the other American Republics,
                            it seems desirable that an additional service between Buenos Aires and
                            Santiago be inaugurated by Panagra. The Department understands
                            consideration is being given by Panagra to such a project and trusts

                        <p>According to a statement made by you to an officer of this Department by
                            telephone on September 4, Panagra would not, because of the personnel

                            monthly aviation gasoline, which may cover Condor requirements in
                            Argentina and perhaps leave a surplus for building reserve stocks.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Also I feel our position somewhat weakened by the fact that American
                            company Intava supplies Condor. Local Standard Oil officials say Intava
                            could cease supplying Condor in Argentina, but such action would cause
                            lawsuit in Brazil, where Standard Oil contracted with Condor for
                            supplies in Argentina and Chile as well. It is again emphasized that key
                            to situation is in Brazil, as relatively little advantage accrues in
                            stopping Condor or Lati here as long as Lati flies Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>Possibly restriction of export permits on ethyl fluid would offer excuse
                            to Standard Oil for canceling Condor contracts in all three countries.
                            If the Department desires to approach the matter from ethyl fluid
                            standpoint, it is suggested that Ethyl Corporatión representatives in
                            Argentina, Brazil and Chile be advised immediately, so that Buenos Aires
                            agency can serve notice on YPF regarding Lati and possibly Condor
                            without delay.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Department’s instruction No. 1162, September 6,<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d364fn3">Not printed.</note> [urge] strongly that Lineas

                        <p>It is suggested that addition of Air France to such be deferred pending
                            developments, unless Department is certain that resumption of line means
                            threat to our interests, and that name should be included to forestall

                            between Santiago and Buenos Aires as an air mail schedule. It is further
                            understood that the Post Office Department is disposed to make such
                            designation, with the understanding that the rate of mail pay on the
                            additional service would be such as might later be determined by the
                            Civil Aeronautics Board in connection with the determination of an air
                            mail rate for Pan American Grace Airways, provided the Department of
                            State feels that such action by the Post Office Department is desirable
                            from the standpoint of foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the foregoing, I desire to state that this Department
                            considers it desirable from the standpoint of foreign affairs to have
                            the additional service by Pan American Grace Airways between Santiago
                            and Buenos Aires designated as an air mail schedule, and takes this
                            occasion to express appreciation of the Post Office Department’s
                            cooperation in this matter.</p>

                        <p>688. Please telegraph the Department the reaction of the Foreign Office
                            to your representations in connection with YPF’s supplying Axis airlines
                            with 100,000 liters of aviation grade gasoline per month.</p>
                        <p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the Interdepartmental
                            Committee from recommending that the YPF be placed on the Proclaimed
                            List. In this connection some confusion has arisen as a result of the
                            statement in your 909 of August 30, 1 p.m.,<note n="55" xml:id="d366fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> that control of importation and distribution of
                            petroleum products has recently been taken from YPF and placed under the
                            Ministry of Marine. Your comment in this regard by telegraph will be
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>The Department will also appreciate being advised by telegraph regarding
                            Argentina’s stocks of ethyl fluid and whether this commodity is imported
                            by YPF direct or through Intava.</p>

                            your findings to the Department. Campodonico added that YPF’s entire
                            output of aviation gasoline goes to the Argentine Army and Navy except
                            for some very small quantities to local commercial distributors.</p>

                        <p>1052. Department’s 688, September 24, 11 p.m., and 703, September 26, 7
                            p.m. As mentioned in Embassy’s telegram No. 981 September 16, 10 p.m. I
                            took up this matter with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs telling
                            him that if Y.P.F. proceeded with any such negotiations our Government
                            might find it necessary to shut off ethyl supplies for Y.P.F. or even
                            place it on our Proclaimed List. The Under Secretary assured me that he
                            would investigate and report as soon as possible, and I shall again take
                            up the matter at earliest opportunity. He seemed much concerned that
                            Y.P.F. might be placed on our Proclaimed List remarking that our
                            Government surely could not consider taking such action against a
                            semi-official Argentine organization. While of course I did not tell him
                            so I feel that such action if seriously considered should be taken only
                            after careful thought and all other alternatives exhausted since Y.P.F.
                            is in a position to retaliate against American companies.</p>
                        <p>It is correct that importation of petroleum products is now under direct
                            supervision of Ministry of Marine instead of Y.P.F., as formerly, but
                            inasmuch as the latter is a semi-official agency, it still exercises
                            strong influence over petroleum policy.</p>
                        <p>Both Standard and Y.P.F. make direct importations of ethyl fluid for
                            their respective consumption. Local office of Ethyl Associated Company
                            estimates present Standard stocks total 1,325 gallons or approximately
                            10 months’ supply. Y.P.F. stocks estimated at 5,554 gallons of which
                            4,230 gallons represent a reserve which is supposed to be maintained for
                            army use. Y.P.F. monthly requirements calculated at 300 gallons. Local
                            ethyl representative understands Y.P.F. now producing 105,680 gallons 87
                            octane and 52,840 gallons 80 octane aviation gasoline per month.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Department’s telegram No. 703, Embassy has not yet had suitable
                            opportunity to take up the matter directly with Y.P.F. Statement that
                            Y.P.F. has never sold aviation gasoline to Lati is believed incorrect as
                            Intava maintains that weekly Lati planes are served by Y.P.F. General
                            manager of Y.P.F. recently told local general manager of Standard that
                            rumor regarding 100,000 liters monthly <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                                facs="0356"/>to Lati was absurd but admitted that Y.P.F. was
                            supplying Lati with normal monthly requirements in Argentina. Embassy
                            endeavoring to obtain expression from Y.P.F. official on this general
                            matter at earliest opportunity.</p>

                            re-establishment of Air France either as a trans-Atlantic service or in
                            the event Brazil continues to refuse it a permit, as a local service
                            operating between Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and so forth. It would seem
                            that Air France may be endeavoring to start an interior service in South
                            America as a talking point in obtaining permission from Brazil to base
                            its trans-Atlantic service there.</p>
                        <p>Do you believe there is any possibility that the Argentine Government
                            would revoke Air France’s operating permit on the ground that it has not
                            and is not likely to establish trans-Atlantic service. For your

                            Buenos Aires and Santiago and in the near future expects to provide

                            gasoline. Roberts, South America representative of Ethyl Gasoline
                            Corporatión, says YPF has a stock of about 4,000 gallons of lead, enough
                            to lead 2,700,000 gallons of gasoline at 3 c.c. per gallon. Please

                        <p>1070. Department’s 721, September 30, midnight. The Embassy feels that
                            there is little or no opportunity of Air France’s permit being revoked
                            by the Argentine Government at this time. This opinion is shared by
                            Bradley, president of local company for Pan American Airways, who is
                            well acquainted with Argentina’s air transportation situation. However
                            Bradley expresses the personal opinion that Air France planes should not
                            be allowed to operate under French registry if the line does not
                            actually connect with France. It is doubtful whether the increased
                            Panagra services between Buenos Aires and Santiago would be sufficient
                            argument to induce Argentina to revoke Air France permit and it is felt
                            that the RFC project should not be mentioned at this time. Furthermore,
                            it is believed that Argentina would like to have as many air services as
                            possible of different nationalities as evidenced by fact that it
                            countenances Lati.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in Embassy’s 1052, September 29, general manager of YPF
                            denied possibility of contract with Lati for 100,000 liters monthly but
                            admitted Lati was receiving small normal quantities for Argentine
                            requirements. Last night a member of the Embassy staff informally
                            discussed this matter with another official of YPF named Benassar who
                            disclaimed knowledge of even the small monthly sales by YPF to Lati.
                            There seems to be no doubt that YPF is selling Lati approximately 10,000
                            liters a month which possibly bears out a suspicion that one section of
                            YPF does not know what another section is doing. Benassar did say that
                            an application had just come across his desk for 100,000 liters of
                            aviation gasoline to be shipped to a firm in Porto Alegre whose name he
                            did not recall. He said he would recommend rejection of the application
                            and that he could count on the support of virtually all YPF
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>While it now appears unlikely that YPF will continue with any
                            negotiations it might have had under consideration for sale of 100,000
                            liters monthly to Lati there are several factors which are still
                            questionable. In the first place I am not certain whether my
                            representations <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0358"/>to the Foreign
                            Office on this matter have been transmitted in full force to YPF. It is
                            also possible that high Argentine officials might look with approval on
                            negotiations with Lati. There is also the apparent lack of coordination
                            within YPF itself.</p>
                        <p>Consequently I feel that the only way we are going to get definite
                            information is by asking the Argentine Government for a statement as to
                            its policy concerning a difference of opinion vis-à-vis Lati. I believe
                            such an inquiry would be more effective if it were made by the
                            Department to Espil.<note n="60" xml:id="d370fn1">Felipe A. Espil,
                                Argentine Ambassador in the United States.</note> At the same time
                            and while I appreciate the position outlined in telegram No. 1299 of
                            September 17, 8 p.m., from the Embassy at Rio de Janeiro to the
                                Department,<note n="61" xml:id="d370fn2">Not printed.</note> I feel
                            that we should be prepared to justify our position in asking Argentina
                            not to sell to Lati when Intava is selling to both Condor and Lati in
                            Brazil and Condor in Argentina.</p>

                        <p>1129. Embassy’s 1080, October 3, 8 p.m.<note n="61" xml:id="d372fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> Today, the general manager of YPF, Mariol Villa,
                            called at the Embassy and expressed considerable concern over status of
                            his company’s contract signed <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0359"
                            />December, 1940 with Phillips Petroleum Company regarding use of
                            petroleum patents and training of YPF engineers in the United States.
                            Villa understands through YPF representative in New York that our
                            Government has requested Phillips to suspend dealings with YPF
                            presumably because latter has been selling aviation fuel to Lati.</p>
                        <p>Villa claims that the small sales made to Lati were transacted because
                            YPF had a surplus of 87 octane fuel caused by Argentine Army and Navy
                            changing to 90 octane.</p>
                        <p>He said YPF sales to Lati began on August 13 and were stopped after
                            September 5, although on September 26 he is reported to have admitted to
                            local general manager for Standard Oil that YPF was supplying Lati with
                            normal monthly requirements for Argentina.</p>
                        <p>At any rate, Villa said this morning that he appreciated our position and
                            promised that YPF would accept no future orders from Lati, Condor or Air
                            France. He desires to know as soon as possible whether such cooperation
                            by YPF would permit resumption of dealings with Phillips Petroleum
                            Company and says otherwise YPF would be seriously handicapped in its
                            normal operations. On the foregoing basis, the Embassy is disposed to
                            recommend that Phillips be allowed to proceed with YPF contract. Should
                            the Embassy learn at some future date that YPF has violated its verbal
                            agreement, the Department will be advised so that appropriate action can
                            be taken.</p>

                        <p>1169. Department’s 797, October 16, 10 p.m.<note n="62" xml:id="d373fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> On October 15, a representative of Intava
                            visited local Quilmes Airport for purpose of verifying Lati stocks. He
                            reported 50 empty drums and 130 full drums of YPF gasoline each
                            containing 200 liters. This means Lati still has enough gasoline for a
                            month or two at least. It likewise indicates Foreign Minister’s
                            statement that Lati would be allowed gasoline for only two or three
                            trips more was a general rather <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0360"
                            />than specific promise. I also feel his stand might have been prompted
                            by pressure which we can bring on YPF rather than by the desire to
                            eliminate Lati because it is Italian.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in previous telegrams there has been confusing information
                            given by YPF and other official sources. Intava also hears that YPF has
                            been installing storage tanks at Quilmes, Airport for Lati. Although
                            Lati still has a supply of YPF gasoline larger than we anticipated it is
                            believed that YPF is now quite worried over possibility of having
                            Phillips contract suspended, as mentioned in Embassy’s 1129, October 13,
                            5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>While YPF did not ask for a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>
                            arrangement it anticipates some reaction as to whether it can continue
                            with its Phillips contract. Should Department wish to reply along these
                            lines, and if such proposal is feasible, it is suggested that YPF be
                            informed that Phillips contract will be resumed but only if YPF makes
                            every effort to withhold gasoline from Condor, Lati, Air France and also
                            Corporación Sud Americana de Servicios Aéreo. This latter Argentine
                            company is Italian controlled and although receiving its own gasoline
                            from Intava it might also be buying from YPF for diversion to Lati.
                            Under such arrangement it is believed that YPF can be restrained from
                            supplying pro-Axis airlines even if Intava subsequently stops supplying
                            Condor.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Condor, the Embassy appreciates the desirability of
                            abolishing such service between Buenos Aires and Santiago but it is
                            problematical whether Argentina would be sympathetic. Following factors
                            raise question as to whether matter should be taken up with Argentine
                            officials and whether Argentina would be willing to take action desired:
                            (1) Condor is nominally a Brazilian company which might make Argentina
                            double [<hi rend="italic">doubly</hi>] hesitant to cancel its
                            concession. (2) While Condor’s service to Chile is undoubtedly extension
                            of Lati trans-Atlantic service Argentina would not regard this as
                            sufficient excuse for cancellation. As long as Lati connects Europe with
                            Brazil, Pan American Airways as common carrier is obliged to act as
                            feeder for other ports of South America. (3) Argentina would have
                            natural reticence in eliminating competition and placing its air
                            connections with Chile in the hands of single foreign company. It would
                            have difficulty in justifying cancellation of Condor which ostensibly
                            has given satisfactory public service, incidentally at lower rates. This
                            angle covered in article page 40 of magazine <hi rend="italic">American
                                Aviation</hi> of September 1st. (4) Regardless of Condor both Pan
                            Air and Panagra would have little difficulty in filling a daily service.
                            In fact present difficulty in getting reservations is creating some
                            feeling <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0361"/>against the company.
                            (5) If Condor service to Chile were canceled before similar action in
                            Brazil it is believed that both Argentina and Chile would question this
                            move particularly if Intava continued to supply Condor in Brazil. I
                            realize that situation in Brazil is complicated and that more factors
                            are involved but past conversations with Intava and other reliable
                            observers confirm opinion that it is difficult to treat Condor and Lati
                            operations in Argentina as a separate problem and that prior or
                            concurrent action in Brazil is essential in properly handling the
                            situation in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that daily service will soon be offered by Pan Air and Panagra
                            and Intava should then curtail or cancel supplies to Condor it is
                            probable that above mentioned arrangement with YPF would keep it from
                            becoming substitute supplier. However, should matter of Condor
                            cancellation be discussed beforehand with Argentina and as seems
                            probable the response should be negative, we would find it doubly
                            difficult to act later on our own initiative through Intava.</p>

                        <p>1178. Referring to Embassy’s 1169 of October 21, 7 p.m. Intava has
                            received instructions from New York to restrict deliveries to Condor for
                            immediate operating requirements only. Condor now has four storage tanks
                            of 10,000 liters each at Quilmes Airport and is installing three more
                            similar, while YPF is understood to be installing two for Lati.</p>
                        <p>There is possibility that when Condor hears of new Intava instructions
                            YPF will be approached and will be tempted to sell enough to fill Condor
                            and Lati tanks since such transaction would be difficult to check.
                            Therefore it is believed that YPF should again be warned within the next
                            few days before Condor makes its next request for Intava gasoline
                            thereby learning of new Intava instructions. Before approaching YPF on
                            this matter does Department wish to state its attitude regarding
                            Phillips contract which can be transmitted to YPF at the same time?
                            Prompt reply will be appreciated.</p>

                        <p>837. Your 1178, October 22, 7 p.m. The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey
                            has instructed its subsidiaries immediately to stop all sales to Axis
                            airlines in view of intimations from this Government that if they should
                            continue to sell to Axis airlines the company and its subsidiaries would
                            be proposed for inclusion in the Proclaimed List. License in special
                            cases would only be granted on the Ambassador’s urgent
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>It is almost certain that if YPF continues to sell gasoline to firms on
                            the Proclaimed List, YPF itself will be proposed for inclusion in that
                            list, and you are authorized again to warn YPF of this prospect.</p>

                            respect to your inquiry whether the Phillips Petroleum Company would,
                            under certain conditions, be permitted to proceed with its contract with

                            requires highly specialized machinery all of which for some time to come

                                objective is elimination of Corporación for we are satisfied
                                Aeroposta is in no sense now under German control or even influence
                                whereas Corporación is in fact controlled [through] indirect
                                ownership by Italian Government. Therefore if we can bring about
                                elimination of Corporación, influence of Italy and Germany in
                                internal lines is eradicated.</p>
                            <p>We are convinced that Argentine Government knows of Italian
                                Government ownership of Corporación but will not voluntarily take
                                any action. Furthermore internal politics make present time most
                                inauspicious for expecting helpful action by Argentina in any
                                general program.</p>
                            <p>In spite of objections to Sana above mentioned we believe that
                                because of inertia of Argentine Government we should take advantage
                                of fact that Sana’s sponsors are energetically interested and have
                                certain influence as evidenced by fact they obtained concession. We
                                believe the new Sana route operated in conjunction with a line from
                                here to Asunción replacing present Corporación operation and also
                                taking in territory to east of it, namely, cities along Uruguayan
                                border, would make a promising operation. We believe it probably
                                desirable that such an operation be developed as an Argentine
                                enterprise headed by an Argentine of highest standing with desired
                                contractual arrangements as to equipment and personnel and
                                management contract with Pan American Airways. Our hope is that such
                                a project would sufficiently appeal to Argentina to cause it to
                                cancel Corporación’s Asunción concession. We would try for inclusion
                                of Aeroposta in above development but as Aeroposta seems satisfied
                                with its present status and believes its present equipment adequate
                                for next few years it may not be possible to obtain at this stage
                                more than an <hi rend="italic">entente cordiale</hi> between
                                Aeroposta and the new operation.</p>
                            <p>Cancellation of Corporación [‘s] Montevideo concession will probably
                                be more difficult and unless you object we should like acting in
                                cooperation with State Department representatives to consider
                                possibility of accomplishing this through Uruguay.</p>

                        <p>1210. With reference to the Department’s 837, October 24, 7 [<hi
                                rend="italic">9</hi>] p.m., local Intava office apparently has not
                            received instructions immediately to cease sales to Axis airline Condor,
                            but as mentioned in <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0364"/>the
                            Embassy’s telegram 1178, October 22, 7 p.m., it was instructed to
                            restrict deliveries to immediate operating requirements, or
                            approximately plane to plane basis. Intava has not supplied Lati in
                            Argentina since August.</p>
                        <p>YPF was again consulted this morning, and general manager Villa
                            reiterates his company has not sold to Lati since September and in
                            future intends to restrict sales of YPF aviation fuel to Argentine Army
                            and Navy. Villa denied YPF constructing storage tanks Quilmes for Lati,
                            which information given Embassy by Intava. Upon further inquiry Intava
                            unable substantiate this rumor. YPF apparently showing earnest desire
                            cooperate in keeping gasoline from Axis airlines, this attitude possibly
                            due to its dependence on American materials and patents. It is very much
                            concerned about suspension of negotiations with Phillips Petroleum
                            Company. With regard to Department’s 842, October 25, 5 p.m., Phillips
                            contract does not involve purchase of “highly specialized machinery for
                            manufacture high octane gasoline”. It merely covers use of Phillips
                            patents and benefit of Phillips research, plus training of YPF
                            technicians and interchange of operating experience between the two
                            companies. Contract was signed December 1940 after months of
                            negotiations, and extends for 5 years. YPF made initial payment of
                            $250,000 and is to pay five subsequent annual installments of $50,000
                            each.</p>
                        <p>In view of YPF’s present disposition to cooperate, and fact that Phillips
                            contract does not involve delivery of machinery, it is recommended that
                            Phillips be allowed to carry out its contract. Embassy would appreciate
                            learning Department’s reaction as soon as possible, as YPF has made
                            several inquiries regarding status of the matter.</p>

                            telegram No. 842 of October 25, 5 p.m., advising you that it would not
                            be feasible in the near future to provide the Yacimientos Petrolíferos
                            Fiscales of Argentina with facilities for the manufacture of high octane
                            gasoline, since these facilities include highly specialized machinery
                            the production of which for some time to come has been earmarked for
                            urgent defense needs.</p>
                        <p>There are enclosed for your strictly confidential information, and for
                            dissemination only to the members of your staff who in your discretion
                                <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0365"/>will have need thereof, (1)
                            a copy of the War Department’s letter of September 19, 1941,<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d379fn1">Not printed.</note> recommending denial of export
                            license for the plant contemplated in the contract between YPF and the
                            Phillips Petroleum Company and (2) a copy of a memorandum prepared by an
                            officer of this Department on October 16, 1941,<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d379fn2">Not printed.</note> regarding the necessity of
                            deferring the provision of identical equipment to the Union of Soviet
                            Socialist Republics, despite the country’s critical needs and our policy
                            of all-out help.</p>
                        <p>It will be evident from a perusal of the enclosed papers that the
                            continued denial of license to export to Argentina plant for the
                            manufacture of high octane gasoline is in no way linked to YPF’s
                            dealings with Axis airlines. Under existing conditions it would not be
                            possible to purvey the desired equipment to Argentina even if YPF agreed
                            completely to stop all sales to firms on the Proclaimed List. Action in
                            this case for the time being is dictated by actual and urgent defense
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>It is appreciated that you will be subjected to great pressure in this
                            matter when it becomes clear to YPF that the plant is not being withheld
                            as a bargaining weapon in negotiations looking towards the elimination
                            of Axis airlines in Argentina. However, the Department is confident that
                            you and the members of your staff who may be involved will bear in mind
                            the wisdom of keeping from the aggressors information as to the
                            tightness of our situation in aviation grade gasoline and our plans for
                            improving that situation.</p>

                        <p>974. Your 1169, October 21. Panagra will establish a daily service on a
                            permanent basis between Buenos Aires and Santiago which will be in
                            effect November 25 eastbound and November 26 westbound.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to notify the Argentine Government that Panagra is
                            establishing the additional frequencies at the request of this
                            Government in order that there will be no reduction in air services
                            between Buenos Aires and Santiago when Condor no longer operates between
                            those points.</p>
                        <p>You may also say that since the daily service will be equal to the
                            present frequencies of Panagra and Condor combined, the United States
                            oil companies concerned are being instructed to furnish no more gasoline
                            to Condor for the Santiago-Buenos Aires run as soon as Panagra’s daily
                            service is in effect.</p>
                        <p>For the time being, the oil companies will be permitted to furnish Condor
                            sufficient gasoline to maintain their present schedules between Buenos
                            Aires and Rio pending the substitution by Pan American of those
                            services.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the YPF will not furnish Condor with any

                        <p>1565. Standard Oil of Brazil has been endeavoring to secure the return of
                            its refueling equipment loaned to Air France in Brazil. In recent
                            conversation with Intava of Buenos Aires, Thomas of Air France refused
                            to give up such equipment unless Intava agreed to furnish small quantity
                            gasoline and fluid to keep its engines in good condition. After
                            consulting with this Embassy Intava insisted on return of its equipment
                            saying no <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> arrangement was possible
                            but that Air France request would be considered after return of
                            material.</p>
                        <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0367"/>
                        <p>Air France has now instructed its Brazilian branches to return equipment
                            to Standard Oil. It has also advised Embassy that its former gasoline
                            stock in Buenos Aires is now exhausted and has requested us to instruct
                            Intava regarding delivery of 500 liters monthly of 73 octane gasoline to
                            regularly run engines on ground plus 50 liters anti-corrosion fluid
                            pointing out that such quantities could be used only for purpose
                            intended. Air France says its flying equipment in Argentina consists of
                            4 trimotors and 1 bimotor plus 17 spare engines.</p>
                        <p>Unless Department perceives objection Embassy will instruct Intava on
                            January 2 to proceed with such deliveries.</p>

                                <p>The Japanese are becoming increasingly aggressive in the market

                                    a short ton unit delivered in Buenos Aires. At present,
                                    therefore, there would seem to be no way to accomplish purpose
                                    other than by taking immediate measures to meet Japanese

                        <p>221. Department’s 94, March 10, noon. In compliance with Department’s
                            instructions to discuss with the authorities here the question of
                            obtaining the entire Argentine output of tungsten and the possible
                            establishment by the Government of an organization to cooperate with the
                            Metals Reserve Company, I discussed and left a memorandum on the subject
                            with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. A member of the staff
                            subsequently spoke of the matter with the sub-manager of the Central
                            Bank, Dr. Edmundo Gagneux. Whereas neither official was in a position to
                            make a definite reply, both indicated interest but at the same time
                            expressed serious doubt whether it would be deemed feasible to ensure
                            the export to the United States of Argentina’s entire production through
                            the organization of such a company.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Gagneux stated that he thought the best and most expeditious way to
                            secure results would be to authorize a commercial concern to enter the
                            market and outbid other buyers.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the opinion that it should be possible for such a commercial
                            representative to make reasonably long-term contracts with the smaller
                            operators and so gain control of the major portion of this country’s
                            production.</p>
                        <p>In view of further evidence of efforts on the part of the Japanese to buy
                            Argentine tungsten and the improbability of any early cooperation on the
                            part of the Argentine Government, it is thought that the Metals Reserve
                            Company may wish to proceed forthwith with the <pb n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360" facs="0370"/>first part of the plan, namely, the
                            authorization of Minerales y Metales S. R. L. to make purchases and
                            possibly enter into contracts insuring control of future production.</p>

                                Nos. 225 and 259 not printed.</note> A memorandum dated March 31 was
                            received today from the Foreign Office in reply to Embassy’s memorandum
                            of March 14 inquiring whether the Argentine Government would be disposed
                            to create an organization to supply the Metals Reserve Company with such
                            part of the Argentine production of tungsten <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361"
                                facs="0371"/>as cannot be obtained through the usual commercial
                            channels. The Chancellery’s note states that [“]the Argentine Government
                            sees no objection to the acquisition by the Government of the United
                            States of our total exportable production of tungsten[”] and that the
                            former would be disposed if necessary to take adequate official steps to
                            promote its production and exportation, always with due respect for
                            constitutional and legal requirements guaranteeing freedom of commerce
                            in this country.</p>
                        <p>As already reported, the Embassy recommends that the purchase program be
                            not deferred until a Government entity can be created since even in the
                            light of the responsiveness of the above reply considerable delay is
                            inevitable and in the meantime the proportion of the Argentine
                            production bought or contracted for by the Japanese is increasing. It
                            will be observed that the reply does not state categorically whether
                            measures will be taken to reserve the total production for export to the
                            United States.</p>

                            the consensus of opinion among the Argentine officials concerned that it
                            would be advisable to follow the “Williams plan”, see Embassy’s telegram
                            252, April 1, 3 p.m.,<note n="76" xml:id="d389fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            saying that “after all the main thing is to prevent tungsten from going
                            to the Far East”. He said they felt that the most practical and
                            expeditious means to this end would be to start purchases through
                            commercial channels and added that this could be done without prejudice
                            to the possible creation later of a government sales entity. He states
                            that the Central Bank would not put any obstacles in the way of forward
                            contracting [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] but on the contrary would be
                            disposed to facilitate the carrying out of the so-called “Williams plan”
                            involving contracting for future production. He stressed the
                            impossibility of quick action in creating a Government sales
                            organization with three separate Ministries involved.</p>
                        <p>In substantiation of his price offer set forth in the Embassy’s telegram
                            last referred to, Williams reports that the lamp division of

                        <p>169. Within the next few days it is planned to grant general licenses for
                            the exportation of certain products exported to Argentina. At the same
                            time it is hoped that the Argentine Government will place tungsten on
                            its list of materials for the export of which a license is required and
                            also take appropriate measures to insure the United States’ obtaining at
                            least 75% of the total tungsten production at a reasonable price and for
                            a period of time. These details to be the subject of further
                            negotiations. While it is not desired to make the liberalizing of our
                            export control licensing contingent upon the Argentine Government’s
                            acceding to our wishes in the matter of tungsten, it is hoped that the
                            Argentine Government will willingly cooperate in the latter matter.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing information is being given to the Argentine Embassy here.
                            You may likewise discuss the foregoing with the Argentine Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs. Please telegraph any action the Argentine Government
                            may take with regard to the control of tungsten exports.</p>

                        <p>338. The matter dealt with in the enclosure to the Department’s
                            instruction No. 775, April 7<note n="79" xml:id="d391fn1">Not

                            Central Bank. It is too soon to express an opinion regarding what the

                            suggestions will be forthcoming within the next day or two.</p>
                        <p>It may prove advisable to link up tungsten exports with one or more
                            specific imports from the United States and the Embassy suggests that
                            zinc and tinplate might be studied in this connection. If the Department
                            is in a position to indicate tentatively what might be regarded as a
                            reasonable price for tungsten concentrates at present for the purposes
                            of these discussions, it would be helpful to have this information.</p>

                            while he readily saw the advantage of a long term contract with the

                            exercised not to bring down on both Governments criticism because of
                            alleged failure to have a due regard for the producers and their
                            employees. It was clear that he hoped for a substantial improvement over
                            the Bolivian price.</p>
                        <p>He stated categorically that he thought there should be a good chance of
                            effecting an arrangement at a price “not too far below that paid by the

                            diverting tungsten to the United States the necessity of securing
                            certain essential materials from the United States. He made it most
                            clear that a direct connection with specific exports from the United

                        <p>240. Reference is made to the Embassy’s No. 415 of May 9 and previous.
                            Metals Reserve Company advises that it will buy the entire Argentine
                            tungsten production at a price in excess of the original Bolivian price
                            and authorizes a bid of $19.00 per unit and a 2-year contract for the
                            entire production. This price is not the absolute top limit but
                            naturally it is hoped that you will be able to make the agreement at the
                            $19.00 price.</p>
                        <p>Such a contract would necessarily involve placing tungsten on the export
                            control list and an agreement to issue no licenses except to the United
                            States and other American republics which have adopted an export control
                            system in collaboration with the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the suggestion that the agreement for the purchase of
                            tungsten be directly connected with the granting of licenses by the
                            United States, the Department makes the following comments:</p>
                        <p>The export control authorities have shown the greatest liberality in
                            granting licenses for the export of United States products to the
                            Argentine. Even where such products are urgently needed here, as for
                            example copper, the United States has gone out of its way to accommodate
                            the needs of the Argentine economy. Specifically, licenses have been
                            granted for the export of rubber, tin, and machine tools. In the face of
                            growing demands for these commodities and materials in our own
                            industries, licenses have been granted with great freedom for chemicals,
                            petroleum, tires, and iron and steel. Only where there is a grave
                            shortage, as in the case of aluminum, has this Government felt compelled
                            to refuse export licenses in cases where the Argentine Government has
                            expressed an interest.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the suggestion in your no. 338 of April 18 that zinc and
                            tin plate be licensed, the Department is advised that a quota of 72,000
                            tons of tin plate for the last 8 months of 1941 has been granted. It is
                            presumed that this arrangement will meet adequately the requirements of
                            Argentina for this material as described in your despatch no. 2327 of
                            April 24.<note n="83" xml:id="d393fn1">Not printed.</note> As to zinc,
                            it would be most difficult to grant licenses in any substantial
                            quantity. At the moment the demand for refined zinc is overwhelming.
                            Small lots in as low as 18 ton quantities are being parceled out, and
                            these are almost entirely for defense uses. The only way in which zinc
                            could be made available <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0375"/>to
                            Argentina would be through the cancellation of private contracts by use
                            of the priorities authority.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these difficulties the Department is willing to make every
                            effort to make available to the Argentine such materials as it needs
                            urgently if this can be done without serious impairment of the national
                            defense effort. It is accordingly suggested that you review this matter
                            with the Argentine governmental authorities and attempt to get their
                            agreement to the sale of the tungsten and the establishment of export
                            control on tungsten as suggested above merely on the basis of the
                            assurance that the United States Government will continue as in the past
                            to give freely and cooperatively assistance in granting licenses for the
                            export of materials needed by the Argentine. If it develops during the
                            course of these conversations that there are specific commodities for
                            which a license is urgently desired, you are requested to telegraph the
                            details as to these requests to the Department.</p>

                                the memorandum printed here is a summary of the June 23
                                offer.</note> that the Federal Loan Agency, in addition to its
                            previous offer to acquire the entire production of Argentine tungsten,
                            was prepared to make an offer to buy certain other products of the
                            Argentine. These products included glycerine, beryl ore, mica, vanadium,
                            antimony, manganese, fluorspar, tin, beryllium oxide, hides and skins,
                            and wool. The offer as to each of these products was substantially in
                            identical form, being to acquire a specified amount of the product, the
                            amount to be approximately the estimated exportable surplus in each
                            instance, with a provision for an option to the Federal Loan Agency to
                            acquire any amounts available for export in excess of the stipulated
                            quantities. As to each product, the proposed agreement would require the
                            Argentine Government to prohibit all exports except to the United States
                            or other American republics having systems of export control paralleling
                            that of the United States. The export to the United Kingdom was also
                            made an exception in the case of hides and skins in view of the fact
                            that hides and skins were listed in the Embassy’s Memorandum of June 16
                            as being within the program of purchases of the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Zinc and lead were treated as in a special category since the entire
                            production is in the hands of a subsidiary of the St. Joseph Lead
                            Company, an American corporation. Quebracho was also treated in a
                            different manner. The telegram submitted two alternative suggestions.
                            The first was to limit the Argentine and Paraguayan production to
                            164,000 tons for the year 1941, of which 20,000 tons would go to the
                            United Kingdom; 109,000 tons to the United States; 10,000 tons to
                            Argentina and other American republics; and 25,000 tons to the Japanese.
                            The other alternative was that the Federal Loan Agency would agree to
                            buy 129,000 tons of the exportable surplus of quebracho for two years as
                            a part of an agreement which would provide for a complete export embargo
                            of this product except to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the
                            other American republics having export control systems parallel to that
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The telegram suggested that an attempt be made to reach an immediate
                            solution as to tungsten. The telegram also included the details of the
                            proposed program of purchases by the United Kingdom for the twelve
                            months beginning September 3, 1941, pointed out that the British and
                            American programs necessarily dovetailed, and suggested there be
                            consultation with the British Ambassador at Buenos Aires with a view of
                            presenting the two buying programs at the same time and developing such
                            a course of action as might foster the conclusion of the agreement
                            suggested in the telegram. It was also suggested <pb n="371"
                                xml:id="pg_371" facs="0381"/>that the American Ambassador call
                            attention once more to the deep interest of the United States in

                        <p>I therefore called on the Brazilian [<hi rend="italic">British</hi>]
                                Ambassador<note n="91" xml:id="d396fn4">Sir Esmond Ovey.</note>
                            yesterday to ascertain why his Embassy had not done so and to express my
                            surprise that we had not been kept informed. I reminded him of our
                            conversation early in July at which Hughes, Cutts, and Jerram (the
                            British Commercial Attaché) were also present, at which it had been
                            agreed that both Embassies should undertake not joint but concurrent
                            discussions with the competent Argentine officials, who would also be
                            informed that each Embassy had full knowledge of the other’s purchase
                            program and was working in complete mutual agreement.</p>
                        <p>Sir Esmond Ovey said that following that meeting it had been decided, and
                            he had so recommended to his Government, that it would be inadvisable to
                            put forward a British buying program as such to the Argentine Government
                            based on Britain’s minimum requirements, especially since the Argentine
                            Government was well aware that the British would under any circumstances
                            be obliged to spend between 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 pounds annually for
                            their minimum requirements in Argentina. He therefore could not see what
                            particular advantage could be derived from offering to this Government a
                            definite buying program unless such a program was to be based on a
                            “generous <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0382"/>scale” and was to be
                            offered in conjunction with ours, for the purpose of making a complete
                            purchase of all Argentine surplus products. Sir Esmond did not explain
                            that his Embassy had failed to keep us informed of this proposed course
                            of action.</p>
                        <p>I informed the British Ambassador that it had been brought to our
                            attention recently that the Argentine Government had been reported as
                            viewing the United States purchase program, as presented, with a certain
                            degree of indifference and regarded it as being incomplete since it
                            contained no mention of meat or wheat.</p>
                        <p>While I presume that the Department may have been advised by the British
                            Embassy in Washington of these developments I feel that the failure of
                            the British here to present a buying program concurrently with ours has
                            probably resulted in delaying action by the Argentine Government and
                            threatens seriously to jeopardize the chances of success of our
                            efforts.</p>

                                <item>With the hope of arriving at a favorable solution of the
                                    problems affecting international trade between Argentina, the
                                    United States and Great Britain, the U.S.G. and H.M.G. have
                                    together reviewed the two lists of purchases of Argentine
                                    products which the British Empire and the U.S. propose to make,
                                    or to guarantee, during the succeeding 12 months period.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>These two lists are largely complementary and in total cover a
                                    wide range of Argentine products; they will guarantee to the
                                    Argentine the disposal of all, or at least the greater portion,
                                    of the exportable surplus of most of her principal products.
                                    Thus, while the offer already put forward by the U.S.G. will
                                    provide a guarantee of the disposal in the U.S. (in so far as
                                    the products in question are not bought by the British Empire or
                                    by Latin American countries) of quantities representing
                                    approximately the normal exportable surplus of wool, hides,
                                    minerals, quebracho and glycerine, H.M.G. are prepared to
                                    purchase, subject to agreement on prices and to the exigencies
                                    of shipping, by far the greater proportion of the production of
                                    meat and animal fats, together with substantial quantities of
                                    wheat, flake eggs, fertilizers, casein, etc. These British
                                    purchases, <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0384"/>together
                                    with British Empire purchases of hides and quebracho, may be
                                    anticipated to involve a total sum of approximately 42 to 44
                                    million pounds sterling.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>In view of the wide range of this joint purchasing program,
                                    which will go far to minimize the inevitable dislocation of
                                    Argentine trade consequent on the war, H.M.G. takes this
                                    opportunity of expressing the anxiety, which they share with the
                                    U.S.G., to secure the conservation of the products in question
                                    and they therefore wish to lend their fullest support to the
                                    proposals already put forward by the U.S.G. that the export of
                                    these products from Argentina should be so controlled as to
                                    ensure that they shall not be directed to destinations outside
                                    the United States, the British Empire and other American
                                    Republics having a similar system of export control.</item>

                            <p>With a view to offering a favorable solution of the problems
                                affecting the foreign trade of Argentina as a result of the
                                dislocation of markets caused by the exigencies of the international
                                situation, the Embassy of the United States of America has the honor
                                to submit a proposal for the purchase, or a guarantee of purchase,
                                of certain Argentine products by the Government of the United States
                                of America for a period of one year. The situation has been
                                similarly reviewed by the British Government who also propose to
                                submit to the Argentine Government a program of purchases covering a
                                complementary list of products. These proposals of the two
                                governments cover such a wide range of Argentine products that it is
                                believed that if an agreement may be reached between the respective
                                governments concerned, there is offered to Argentina a guarantee for
                                the disposal of the greater portion of the exportable surplus of
                                most of its principal products.</p>
                            <p>On July 2, 1941 an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> was
                                transmitted to the Foreign Office, stating that the Government of
                                the United States, through the Federal Loan Agency, was prepared to
                                acquire specified Argentine products under certain conditions, of
                                which the most important is that the Argentine Government would
                                restrict the exportation of such products to the British
                                Commonwealth of Nations, the United States and other American
                                republics having a similar system of export control.</p>
                            <p>By Executive Decree No. 97,752 of August 21, 1941 the Argentine
                                Government specifically imposed restrictions on the export of
                                certain <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0385"/>of the products set
                                forth in the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of July
                                2, 1941. It is hoped that conversations may be undertaken at an
                                early date which may lead to the conclusion of an agreement between
                                the governments concerned, putting into effect the complete program
                                envisaged.</p>

                                Embassy of September 9 [<hi rend="italic">3?</hi>] last, offers on
                                behalf of its Government to purchase or to guarantee the purchase of
                                certain Argentine products during the period of one year, and it
                                (the Argentine Government) hopes to reach in a short time an
                                agreement with the Government of the United States and the British
                                Government which will permit it to carry out as soon as possible a
                                full program of exports to those countries, in accordance with the
                                suggestions contained in the notes of the United States and the

                                minerals, glycerine, hides and skins, wool and quebracho, the
                                exportable surplus of which would be purchased by the United States
                                according to the terms of the memorandum of July 2, 1941, and the
                                British Government would be disposed to purchase, subject to an

                                considerable quantities of wheat, dried eggs, fertilizers, casein,

                                will probably remain unchanged—a relatively easy and remunerative

                            <item>As the plan refers to comprehensive operation and enjoining
                                certain limitations to the possibilities of our exportation, the
                                Argentine Government is forced to take into account the interests of
                                other branches of Argentine agricultural and livestock production.
                                Mention has already been made of the sacrifices which it has been
                                necessary to make [to] maintain the activity of a wide portion of
                                rural classes which form the most solid and stable nucleus of the
                                social organization of the republic. It is quite aware of the almost
                                unsurmountable difficulty which exists for taking into consideration
                                the totality of Argentine agricultural products, but it also
                                believes that it is possible to find solutions which will permit the

                            <item>Another point which causes concern to the Argentine Government is
                                the British proposal which subjects the scope of the plan to new
                                requirements. The Argentine Government realizes the difficulty
                                deriving from the problem but it considers that in order to meet the
                                aims of this negotiation, goods could be purchased in accordance
                                with commitments to be agreed upon, letting it be understood that if
                                difficulties arise in navigation the goods will remain deposited
                                pending the possibility of their transportation.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>In conclusion the Argentine Government is disposed to establish a
                                control of exports in the manner requested by the Governments of the
                                United States and Great Britain, save for small quantities which are
                                exported to countries which in turn supply Argentina with the goods
                                necessary to maintain the equilibrium of Argentine economy, thus
                                avoiding an undue raise in prices.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In short, the Argentine Government is disposed to study with the
                            representatives of the Governments of the United States and of Great
                            Britain all the problems set forth and it hopes that an understanding of
                            the requirements of each one of the parties will permit the rapid
                            conclusion of an agreement taking into account reciprocally the national
                            interests involved.[”]</p>

                        <p>1116. Reference is made to the Embassy’s telegram 1101, October 9, 1
                            p.m., transmitting the text of the memorandum dated October <pb n="379"
                                xml:id="pg_379" facs="0389"/>7, 1941, received from the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs concerning over-all purchase proposal which the Embassy
                            understands is identical with that handed to the British Embassy by the
                            Argentine Government, the Department will observe that paragraphs 2 to 6
                            inclusive of the Argentine Government’s reply to us have reference
                            wholly to the British part of the program and are only of indirect
                            concern to us. Following a discussion with the British Commercial
                            Counselor, Mr. Jerram, and Mr. Cutts, Attaché of the British Embassy, we
                            gained the impression that they do not regard the project of the blocked
                            sterling question as being germane to their part of the purchase
                            program. From their unofficial reaction it would appear probable that
                            the British Embassy will recommend to its Government that the question
                            of blocked sterling should be considered apart from their purchase
                            program.</p>
                        <p>In so far as our Government is concerned we consider the reply of the
                            Argentine Government as constituting a workable basis upon which to
                            carry on negotiations of a more specific nature with a view to
                            concluding an agreement for the purchase of exportable surplus of
                            products under consideration.</p>
                        <p>There are two main points in the Argentine Government’s reply which
                            should be clarified before definite negotiations are undertaken.</p>
                        <p>The first concerns paragraph 9 which expresses the hope that the list of
                            purchases proposed by the United States and Great Britain should be
                            extended to include products such as linseed, butter, canned meat, pork
                            products, etc., we consider, however, that only linseed has reference to
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The second point one [<hi rend="italic">on</hi>] which a clearer
                            understanding must be reached is contained in paragraph 1 (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) [<hi rend="italic">paragraph 13</hi>] which he
                            states that the Argentine Government is disposed to establish a control
                            of exports in the manner requested except for small quantities which are
                            exported to countries which in turn supply Argentina with the goods
                            necessary to maintain the equilibrium of Argentine economy. Williams of
                            the Federal Loan Agency has requested from the competent officials the
                            exact interpretation to be [put?] upon “these small quantities” and a
                            clarification is expected shortly.</p>
                        <p>In view of the generally favorable nature of the Argentine reply, it is
                            suggested that authority be granted to proceed immediately with the
                            negotiations with a view to concluding an agreement for the purchase of
                            the various products under consideration. It is furthermore suggested
                            that such action be authorized irrespective of the progress of the
                            British negotiations and with no [indication] whatsoever that the two
                            proposals are combined in any manner beyond the recognized mutual
                            interest of the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>I could not escape the impression during our informal conversation with
                            the British that they are still adopting a somewhat defeatist attitude
                            with regard to their purchase program which, in my opinion, may have
                            been accentuated by the blocked sterling question being projected into
                            the program.</p>
                        <p>Williams was informed today by a responsible Argentine official that the
                            utmost urgency existed for an early conclusion of the purchase program,
                            since the Argentine Government was being flooded by requests for export
                            licenses of many of the commodities included in our program. This
                            official added that such requests were being held in suspense but that
                            the pressure was great.</p>

                            note the third paragraph relative to a commitment to supply the
                            Argentine Republic with various materials and to make same part of the
                            over-all agreement. They insisted they could not accept elimination of
                            this paragraph as such elimination would not be in keeping with decree
                            number 97752 and would leave the tungsten agreement open to attack in
                            the courts by those interested in continuance of exports to Axis
                            countries. This is the opinion of the Interministerial Committee as a
                            whole which further expressed the view that failure to include this
                            paragraph might result in eventual annulment of the proposed tungsten
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>We consider the wording “as far as possible” noncommittable and earnestly

                            note. There is no need to stress the importance of concluding this
                            agreement at the earliest possible date.</p>

                        <p>805. Reference your 1121 of October 11. The Department does not desire to
                            regard the commitment which it proposes to take with respect to
                            furnishing materials to Argentina as noncommittal or to rely upon the
                            phrase “as far as possible” as in effect nullifying the obligations of
                            this Government. On the contrary, the Department has made every effort
                            in cases where overall agreements have been entered into with countries
                            such as Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru to make available to the
                            greatest extent practicable commodities of this country even though they
                            be in short supply at the time. In short, the commitment which this
                            Government is ready to undertake in favor of countries who cooperate
                            with the United States in making their strategic materials available to
                            us is substantial and real.</p>
                        <p>The Department is willing and intends to make such a commitment as a part
                            of the overall agreement and is willing to agree to do so at this time.
                            The Department accordingly suggests as an alternative to Torriani’s
                            proposal that the tungsten contract contain an agreement on the part of
                            this Government to enter into such a commitment as a part of the overall
                            agreement. It is further suggested that there be substituted for the
                            phrase “as far as possible” the phrase “to the greatest extent
                            compatible with the national defense.”</p>

                        <p>930. In view of recommendations in your 1230 of October 31<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d403fn1">Not printed.</note> and Williams’ letter to
                                Bridgman<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">G. Temple Bridgman, vice
                                president of the Metals Reserve Company.</note> of October 24, the
                            Federal Loan Agency is willing, if it is necessary to do so to obtain
                            approval of the overall agreement, to offer to purchase 30 million
                            bushels of flaxseed during the year 1942 on the following conditions.
                            First, as to 20 million bushels, the Loan Agency will purchase such
                            amount of such 20 million bushels as shall not be purchased by the
                            private trade in this country, the underwriting price to be agreed upon
                            by Defense Supplies Corporation and the Argentine Government and
                            one-half of the 20 million bushels to be transported in Argentine
                            vessels. Second, the <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0392"/>balance of
                            10 million bushels will be purchased by Defense Supplies to the extent
                            that it is not acquired by the private trade in this country, the price
                            to be the same as that for the 20 million bushels and one-half of this
                            10 million bushels to be transported in Argentine ships, but as to this
                            10 million bushels, the agreement of Defense Supplies Corporation is
                            conditioned on the obligation of the Argentine Government to provide
                            storage facilities on a reasonable basis. Indications are that storage
                            facilities for flaxseed in this country will be difficult if not
                            impossible to obtain. If the Argentine Government finds itself unable to
                            agree to furnish this storage space, you are requested to telegraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) what storage facilities there are in Argentina
                            in terms of millions of bushels; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) whether
                            there are sufficient crushing facilities in Argentina to convert all or
                            part of the 10 million bushels into linseed oil; and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) whether it would be possible to store the oil so crushed or
                            any part of it. The third condition of the Defense Supplies Corporation
                            is that the Argentine Government in consideration of this underwriting
                            agreement by Defense Supplies shall agree to prohibit during the year
                            1942 the export of flaxseed except to the United States and the British
                            Empire (including, in cases where either have made purchases on behalf
                            of a third party, such designations for direct shipments as they
                            nominate); and also to the other American republics having systems of
                            export control approved by the Government of the United States.</p>

                        <p>Negotiations have been under way in Buenos Aires since June of this year
                            for the acquisition by the Federal Loan Agency of a long list of
                            strategic materials from Argentina. The chief purpose of the agreement
                            is to obtain for the United States additional supplies of the important
                            strategic materials produced in Argentina. It will also have the result
                            of affording to Argentina a stabilized market for many of her products
                            during this period of disturbed international commerce.</p>

                            representative in Buenos Aires, Mr. Thomas J. Williams, to come to
                            Washington for a discussion of the many details of price and method that
                            remain to be settled. It is also reported that this is one of the

                                Under Secretary of Finance.</note> plans to review with us.</p>
                        <p>The tungsten agreement is in the form of an underwriting—that is, the
                            Metals Reserve Company has agreed to buy for a period of three years at
                            $21 per unit, up to a maximum of 3,000 tons of concentrates each year,
                            such amount of the exportable surplus of Argentina tungsten as shall not
                            be bought by the private trade in the United States.</p>
                        <p>It will probably be found most expedient that most of the remaining
                            minerals—fluorspar, manganese ore, antimony ore, vanadium ore, tin and
                            silver ore, beryl ore and mica—will be bought during the contract period
                            by Metals Reserve Company, which will resell to private users or place
                            in stock pile. There will obviously have to be an agreement on price.
                            The Argentine Government will establish an export control which will
                            prohibit the export of these minerals except to the Metals Reserve
                            Company in the United States, the British Empire, the other American
                            republics having systems of export control approved by the Government of
                            the United States and other purchasers which may be designated by the
                            United States or the United Kingdom. The quantities of metal in question
                            are small.</p>
                        <p>Zinc and lead concentrates are a special case. The entire exportable
                            surplus of these materials in Argentina is owned by a subsidiary of the
                            St. Joseph Lead Company, a United States corporation, and the Metals
                            Reserve Company will enter into a contract with this subsidiary for the
                            acquisition of its entire exportable surplus. The standard export
                            control provision will apply to these materials.</p>
                        <p>Beryllium oxide is also in a special category. This commodity, in
                            contrast to the other minerals, will be purchased for a period of two
                            years. It is all produced by one company. This commodity will be
                            purchased directly by Metals Reserve Company and the standard export
                            control provision will obtain.</p>
                        <p>The form of the wool agreement is a simple underwriting. The offer of
                            Defense Supplies Corporation is to purchase specified amounts of various
                            grades of wool, less amounts exported to private purchasers in the
                            United States and to the other permissible destinations. <pb n="386"
                                xml:id="pg_386" facs="0396"/>Export control will prohibit the
                            shipment of wool except to the United States and to the other
                            permissible destinations.</p>
                        <p>Linseed. Linseed differs from the other commodities in that the amount to
                            be purchased by the United States private importers and Defense Supplies
                            Corporation is less than the total exportable surplus of Argentine
                            linseed. The offer in this case is that Defense Supplies Corporation
                            (with the approval of the Department of Agriculture) will purchase 30
                            million bushels during the calendar year 1942 less the amount of sales
                            made through commercial channels to United States purchasers. The
                            Argentine exportable surplus of linseed is more than twice the amount to
                            be so guaranteed by Defense Supplies Corporation.</p>
                        <p>Quebracho. Quebracho is another special case. The potential production of
                            quebracho in Argentina is large. It has been held to a fixed limit
                            through the operation of a pool, operated by the Forestal Company, an
                            English company. Unlike the commodities discussed above, the British
                            desire a substantial amount (20,000 tons) of this material. The plan
                            accordingly is that the Argentine Government will restrict the export of
                            quebracho to a total of 115,000 tons in each year and this amount will
                            be allocated through Argentine Government action as follows: (<hi

                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to the United Kingdom, 20,000 tons; and
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) to Defense Supplies Corporation, 85,000
                            tons. There will be no purchases by the private purchasers in the United
                            States since such purchases would be inconsistent with the fixed limit
                            on production. The Argentine export control will restrict exports in
                            accordance with the above figures.</p>
                        <p>Cotton linters. The Argentine purchase of cotton linters is part of a
                            program which includes Brazil and Mexico. Defense Supplies Corporation
                            has received a recommendation from the Office of Production Management
                            and the Department of Agriculture that it acquire 250,000 bales of
                            cotton linters, less some amount to be agreed upon to be shipped from
                            Brazil directly to the United Kingdom. The total amounts recommended are
                            200,000 bales from Brazil, 25,000 bales from Mexico, and 25,000 bales
                            from Argentina, being approximately the entire exportable surpluses of
                            the respective countries. The purchase is being made in all three
                            instances by the Defense Supplies Corporation in accordance with the
                            recommendation of the Office of Production Management and the Department
                            of Agriculture. Export control in Argentina will provide that exports
                            may be made only to Defense Supplies Corporation and to the other
                            American republics having parallel systems of export control.</p>
                        <p>Casein. Casein is unique in that it is desired to divide the supply
                            available between the United Kingdom and the United States. The <pb
                                n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0397"/>British are accordingly
                            proposing to the Argentine Government to purchase a specified amount of
                            the two grades of casein and Defense Supplies Corporation will acquire
                            the balance. Export control will limit exports to the United Kingdom and
                            to Defense Supplies Corporation in the United States. If there is any
                            demand, exports will also be allowed to the other American republics
                            having parallel systems of export control.</p>
                        <p>Glycerine. The form of this offer is that Defense Supplies Corporation
                            shall acquire the entire exportable surplus of Argentina. The present
                            limit suggested is 10 million pounds. The glycerine so acquired will be
                            kept in Government stockpile to the extent possible and to the extent
                            required by the domestic trade will be allocated by Office of Production
                            Management orders. The Argentine export control will prohibit the export
                            of glycerine except to the Defense Supplies Corporation, the other
                            American republics having parallel systems of export control, and the
                            United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Hides. Hides present a difficult case. The Argentine exportable surplus
                            of high grade hides is substantially less than the combined United
                            States and British demand. The Office of Production Management has been
                            working for some time with representatives of the British Leather
                            Control for the purpose of determining how these high grade hides shall
                            be divided. These discussions are currently continuing. The method which
                            will be adopted will depend upon the result of these conversations. The
                            Office of Production Management has formally recommended to the Federal
                            Loan Agency by a letter from Mr. Knudsen<note n="7" xml:id="d405fn4"
                                >William S. Knudsen, Director General of the Office of Production

                            States be acquired by Defense Supplies Corporation.</p>

                        <p>10. Strictly confidential for the Ambassador only. Your 621 December 19,
                            11 a.m.<note n="9" xml:id="d406fn1">Not printed.</note> The President
                            doubts the advisability at this time of announcing trade-agreement
                            negotiations with Argentina, since such announcement might arouse
                            political opposition in Congress at a time when it is urgently and
                            vitally necessary to obtain speedy and <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388"
                                facs="0398"/>favorable action by the Congress with respect to aid to
                            Great Britain. The President has stated, however, that if a satisfactory
                            basis can be found trade-agreement negotiations with Argentina may be
                            announced after appropriate aid to Britain legislation has been passed
                            by the Congress. This may take from 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to see personally the Ministers for Foreign
                                Affairs<note n="10" xml:id="d406fn2">Julio A. Roca.</note> and
                                Finance<note n="11" xml:id="d406fn3">Federico Piñedo.</note> at the
                            earliest practicable opportunity and explain the situation
                            confidentially to them, adding that on the basis of the confidential and
                            informal talks thus far held with Prebisch<note n="12" xml:id="d406fn4"
                                >Raúl Prebisch, manager of the Central Bank of Argentina.</note> the
                            Department is hopeful that the negotiations can be announced soon after
                            the aid to Britain legislation has been passed.<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d406fn5">Lend-Lease Act passed March 11, 1941; 55 Stat.
                                31.</note></p>
                        <p>In the Department’s view it would have a most unfortunate effect on
                            Argentine public opinion if Prebisch should return to Buenos Aires prior
                            to announcement of intention to negotiate a trade agreement. His return
                            under such circumstances might be interpreted as a partial failure of
                            his mission. Moreover, the Department believes that Prebisch is a key
                            official in the matter of obtaining a trade agreement with Argentina and
                            probably would be most effective in getting speedy acceptance by the
                            Argentine Government of a satisfactory basis for negotiations.
                            Accordingly, you are also requested to ask Drs. Roca and Piñedo on my
                            behalf to have appropriate instructions issued to Prebisch to remain in
                            Washington so that all questions which might result in failure of
                            negotiations can be settled before announcement.</p>
                        <p>The interim period could be used to good advantage in discussing the
                            proposed trade agreement, provided there were no leak that such
                            discussions were taking place. If a leak should occur, the Department
                            would be obliged to issue a statement to the effect that negotiations
                            with Argentina are not in progress. You will appreciate that complete
                            secrecy is essential.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph Roca’s and Piñedo’s reactions.</p>

                        <p>33. In our preliminary confidential discussions with Prebisch regarding
                            bases for a trade agreement, it has appeared that Argentina is disposed
                            to grant Spain a substantial credit which would enable Spain, if the
                            British Government were agreeable, to purchase Argentine foodstuffs. In
                            this connection reference has been made to press reports that the
                            British Government has agreed to permit Spain to buy Argentine corn,
                            payment to be made in blocked sterling in London, and also that
                            Argentina has under consideration a direct credit to Spain.</p>
                        <p>Prebisch has stated that he has no official information regarding the
                            matter, but has long advocated a large credit to Spain on the <pb
                                n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0400"/>grounds that it is preferable
                            to put Argentina’s surplus foodstuffs to work, though doing so would
                            involve great risk of nonpayment, than to have them rot in Argentine
                            storage.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if you would endeavor to ascertain from the
                            British Embassy and the Argentine Government or other sources whether
                            such credit negotiations are in progress and if so what amounts of
                            foodstuffs are involved and what method of payment is contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The matter is of interest to the Department for various reasons including
                            the question of the effects of blocked sterling and barter deals on
                            Argentina’s ability to give us nondiscriminatory treatment in exchange
                            and quantitative restrictions on imports.</p>

                        <p>95. With reference to the Department’s confidential telegram No. 33,
                            January 27, 7 p.m., in view of the Cabinet crisis here and resignations
                            of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance, it is difficult to secure
                            information from responsible officials with regard to the Government’s
                            policies on a question of this importance. However, in a talk which the
                            Commercial Attaché<note n="15" xml:id="d410fn1">Thomas L. Hughes.</note>
                            has had with high officials of the Central Bank, they stated with regard
                            to the possible sale to Spain of Argentine corn and other foodstuffs
                            that conversations are now being held to that end but no conclusions
                            have been reached. He [<hi rend="italic">They?</hi>] explained that on
                            other occasions cotton and wheat have been sold to Spain in minor
                            quantities and payment had been effected at least on one occasion by the
                            cancellation of bonds held by the Spanish Government. In another case
                            service on foreign obligations owed by Argentina were cancelled in the
                            Spanish Treasury.</p>
                        <p>When questioned as to the rumor of payment for corn sent to Spain being
                            made in blocked sterling, he [<hi rend="italic">they?</hi>] immediately
                            replied that he [<hi rend="italic">they?</hi>] had no indication of such
                            a plan and that Argentina would hardly be interested in receiving more
                            blocked sterling as she already had too much.</p>
                        <p>The same officials added that the matter of blocked sterling was one
                            which they felt Argentina could not solve alone and that eventually it
                            must be solved through a triangular arrangement in which the United
                            States was directly or indirectly involved.</p>

                        <p>I have not yet been able to approach the British Embassy in this
                            matter—the Ambassador is away—but expect to do so in the next few days
                            and will telegraph any information secured.</p>

                        <p>I explained to the Secretary yesterday that we had reached agreement with
                            Dr. Prebisch on the general provisions, final minutes, exchanges of
                            notes and proposals with respect to the schedules; that I had agreed to
                            seek Secretary Hull’s approval of these documents as a basis for
                            trade-agreement negotiations with Argentina in the event that it should
                            be decided to undertake such negotiations; and that Dr. Prebisch had
                            agreed to recommend them to his Government. I explained to the Secretary
                            further, that if he indicated his approval by initialing the attached
                            covering memorandum,<note n="16" xml:id="d411fn1">Not printed.</note>1
                            would then initial the original and give it to Dr. Prebisch together
                            with the enclosures and ask him to initial our blue copy of it, advising
                            Dr. Prebisch orally that the Secretary had approved the basis.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to the Secretary that if he approved the basis as outlined
                            in these documents we would be bound by these proposals if it should be
                            decided to undertake the negotiations, subject, of course, to the
                            President’s approval, to agreement with the Argentines on proposals
                            which they later will make regarding their Schedule I<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d411fn2">Schedule of rates of duties on articles grown,

                            qualification that any of our proposed tariff concessions could be
                            altered if new facts or considerations submitted in written briefs or in
                            the public hearings should so require. I said, however, that in view of
                            the extensive hearings held a year ago and the numerous times these
                            concessions have been discussed, it is unlikely that any new facts or
                            considerations will be presented.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of several points, the Secretary, who had been
                            given these documents for study several days ago, indicated his approval
                            of the proposed basis and initialed the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Today I handed Dr. Prebisch the originals of the attached documents after
                            initialing the covering memorandum and obtaining his initials on the
                            attached blue copy. In doing so, I advised him that the Secretary had
                            approved the recommendations embodied in these documents.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0402"/>
                        <p>I referred to the fact that we have not yet reached an understanding on
                            the basis for Argentina’s concessions in Schedule I of the agreement,
                            and suggested that the proposals now under discussion be considered by
                            the Argentine Government and that the latter Government make definite
                            proposals to us with respect to the Schedule. We would then consider
                            them and submit them for approval. Our proposals regarding the rest of
                            the agreement are, of course, contingent on a satisfactory basis being
                            worked out for Schedule I.</p>
                        <p>I also emphasized to Dr. Prebisch the necessity of keeping these matters
                            completely confidential; that if there should be premature publicity
                            causing political repercussions here and adversely affecting other
                            important issues, it might be necessary to make denials which would
                            render it difficult to proceed with the negotiations. Dr. Prebisch said
                            that he recognized fully the need for, and importance of, secrecy, and
                            that he did not intend to submit the proposals to the Argentine
                            Government for study until he received word from us that this would be
                            all right; that he would meanwhile confine the studies of these
                            documents to officials of the Central Bank where there would be no
                            danger whatever of leakage.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Prebisch then referred to his conversation with Mr. Wheeler<note
                                n="18" xml:id="d411fn3">Leslie A. Wheeler, Director of the Office of
                                Foreign Agricultural Relations.</note> at the Department of
                            Agriculture this morning regarding flaxseed, which he said was very
                            discouraging to him in that it did not appear that the Department of
                            Agriculture has materially changed its policy in the direction of
                            discouraging flaxseed production, and particularly because of the
                            estimate of an official of the Department of Agriculture that imports
                            are not on the average likely to exceed 10,000,000 bushels. He said that
                            in view of Department of Agriculture’s policies and the discouraging
                            outlook for imports of Argentine flaxseed, he felt compelled to make
                            less favorable recommendations respecting Argentine concessions in
                            Schedule I than he had previously intended. For this reason, he was not
                            prepared to recommend the proposals for Schedule I which had been drawn
                            up. Nevertheless, I gave him copies of these proposals, marking them
                            “tentative”, and suggested that on his return to Buenos Aires he draw up
                            a firm offer on Schedule I and submit it to us for consideration. I
                            reminded him, however, that all of our proposals regarding other parts
                            of the agreement are conditioned upon a satisfactory Schedule I and
                            urged him to keep the foregoing in mind in formulating the proposals on
                            this Schedule. I said further that if the proposals submitted by the
                            Argentine Government were materially less favorable than those we had
                            discussed, I did not think they could be accepted.</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>With respect to the subject of regional preferences, I said that the
                            Secretary, having approved our proposals, is sending a note to this
                            effect to the Argentine Ambassador in reply to the Ambassador’s note on
                            this subject. I asked, however, that care be taken to avoid any
                            publicity on this subject until it comes up in the Inter-American
                            Committee, and that when the matter does become public an effort be made
                            to dispel the idea that this involves the abandonment or any material
                            impairment of the policy of either country with respect to the
                            most-favored-nation principle. I said that press reports of the
                            discussion of this subject at the Montevideo Conference indicated the
                            need of taking steps to avoid such misinterpretation. Dr. Prebisch said
                            that he would make every effort to see that this matter is not
                            misconstrued in the manner indicated.</p>

                                of State Executive Agreement Series No. 277, or 56 Stat. (pt. 2)
                                1685, with the following exceptions:</p>
                            <p>Article IV, paragraph 3: The following sentence in the draft does not
                                appear in the final agreement: “If the Government of either country
                                avails itself of the rights reserved under this paragraph, it shall
                                inform the government of the other country in writing.”</p>
                            <p>Article VI, paragraph 2: The phrase in the first sentence of the
                                final agreement “prior to the date of publication” reads in the
                                draft: “prior to the expiration of thirty days after the date of
                                publication.”</p>

                            <p>Article XV, paragraph 2: At the end of this paragraph there was a
                                footnote reading as follows: “The Government of the United States
                                may wish to propose the following additional clause: ‘(<hi

                            <p>Article XVI. This article in the draft contained three paragraphs
                                instead of two as in the final agreement. Paragraph 1 was omitted
                                    <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0404"/>and the other
                                paragraphs were renumbered in the final draft. Paragraph 1
                                reads:</p>
                            <p>“Greater than nominal penalties will not be imposed in the United

                                despite any eventual reduction in total customs revenues.</p>
                            <postscript>
                                <p>It was understood also that sympathetic and objective
                                    consideration would be given to the requests for modifications
                                    of the descriptions of articles indicated in tentative Schedule
                                    I of January 15, 1941; to the notes included in the said
                                    schedule; and to the requests for duty reductions or adjustments
                                    in tariff classification, as the case may be, in respect of
                                    those articles listed in Part B of the attached tentative
                                    Schedule I.</p>
                                <p>It was further understood that any preference in regard to
                                    sulphur would be confined to Chilean sulphur and that the United
                                    States would be given a quota on sulphur amounting to not less
                                    than 10% of the total importations during the period of
                                    hostilities between the United Kingdom and Germany.</p>
                                <p>With reference to machines and spare parts (weighing less than
                                    100 net kilograms) and automobile parts and accessories, it was
                                    agreed that duty reductions would be granted on those machines,
                                    parts and accessories which are not now produced in Argentina at
                                    all or are not being produced there on a sound economic basis,
                                    or on those subject to unreasonably high duties. In the case of
                                    other machines, parts and <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397"

                                    binding existing rates of duty.</p>

                                and other forms of compensation on sales, which may have the effect
                                of artificially determining prices or which, by interfering with the

                            telegram 95, January 31, 7 p.m. In a conversation with the Commercial
                            Counselor of the British Embassy<note n="21" xml:id="d412fn1">Cecil B.
                                Jerram.</note> yesterday regarding report that the British
                            Government has agreed to permit Spain to buy Argentine corn, payment to
                            be made in blocked sterling in London, the former official stated that
                            as far as the British Embassy here is aware no consideration has been
                            given to such a proposal. The British <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
                                facs="0408"/>Commercial Counselor stated, however, that the British
                            Government had agreed to deliver to Spain 50,000 tons of wheat from
                            their stocks purchased in Argentina. Although he did not explain the
                            manner in which this transaction is being consummated, it seems
                            reasonable to assume that the purchase of wheat by the British
                            Government from which this quantity is to be taken merely increased the
                            amount of blocked sterling in London to the credit of the Argentine
                            Government, and that in effect the shipment of the 50,000 tons of wheat
                            to Spain is paid with blocked sterling.</p>
                        <p>The British Commercial Counselor seemed to feel that this transaction may
                            have been the basis for the press reports.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: As you know, we have
                            sought over a period of years to bring about improved relations with
                            Argentina, a matter which is of course of particular importance at this
                            critical time. A fundamental requirement in achieving this end is
                            improvement in our trade relations with that country.</p>
                        <p>When Dr. Prebisch, Manager of the Argentine Central Bank, was here to
                            arrange for loans to Argentina, he took the occasion to explore with us
                            again the possibilities of concluding a trade agreement. Argentina’s
                            present interest in improved trade opportunities arises not only in
                            connection with the problem of servicing and repaying the loans, and of
                            avoiding the impairment of Argentina’s high credit standing, but, even
                            more importantly, that interest has of course been accentuated by the
                            extremely difficult trade problems which have grown out of the war in
                            Europe and the closing of continental markets to Argentine products.</p>
                        <p>Although the question of an Argentine trade agreement has in the past
                            provoked considerable controversy of a political sort, the negotiation
                            of an agreement which would ease Argentina’s position, and at the same
                            time be beneficial to ourselves, would not, it is believed, require
                            granting of concessions which could not be defended. On our part, it
                            would include the more important concessions indicated in the attached
                                schedules<note n="22" xml:id="d413fn1">Not printed.</note> which
                            were discussed with Dr. Prebisch on the occasion of his visit here. In
                            discussing these concessions with him we of course made it clear that we
                            could make no definite commitments until after considering information
                            and views submitted <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0409"/>in briefs
                            or in public hearings after formal announcement of intended
                            negotiations. The concessions indicated are recommended by the
                            interdepartmental Trade Agreements Committee on the basis of exhaustive
                            studies made over a long period of time and in the light of the current
                            situation. On Argentina’s side, the agreement would provide substantial
                            benefits for American trade, particularly with the return of more normal
                            times.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the present time is particularly opportune for finally
                            disposing of this long-standing and difficult matter. Under present
                            conditions, domestic producers are enjoying greatly augmented protection
                            owing to Argentina’s increased shipping costs and other difficulties of
                            exporting to this country. Furthermore, there is growing realization by
                            the people of this country that good trade relations with the other
                            American Republics, notably Argentina, are essential to effective
                            hemisphere cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, if you approve,<note n="23" xml:id="d413fn2">The original
                                bears the following notation “CH OK FDR”.</note> I shall advise the
                            Argentine Government that, if a basis for a trade agreement can be
                            completed within a reasonable time, we would be prepared to issue the
                            usual public notice of intention to negotiate the agreement and
                            thereafter to conclude the negotiations as rapidly as possible.</p>

                            publication of the announcement of the hearings for a trade agreement
                            between our two countries.<note n="24" xml:id="d414fn1">The Secretary of
                                State issued formal notice of intention to negotiate a trade
                                agreement with Argentina on May 13, 1941; see Department of State

                        <p>I said that in my judgment this was of historical importance since, as
                            the Minister well knew, it was almost ninety years since a commercial
                            treaty had been negotiated between the two countries, and I felt that in
                            this sense it matched in importance the visit made to <pb n="400"
                                xml:id="pg_400" facs="0410"/>Washington by the Minister since it was
                            the first visit paid to this country by an Argentine Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. I said I hoped and believed that these two events of
                            such great significance marked the commencement of a new and
                            ever-increasingly close relationship between our two countries which I
                            felt confident was in the best interest of our two peoples. I said I was
                            equally sure that the Minister in his new office would be of the
                            greatest service in furthering that desirable objective. To this the
                            Minister heartily replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>I touched briefly upon the Tierra del Fuego sanitary issue<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d414fn2">This issue concerned the embargo on meat entering
                                the United States from Argentina because of animal disease in a
                                particular area of the country; see unperfected sanitary convention

                            was now being given the most careful consideration by the interested
                            departments of this Government and that I trusted that a decision—which
                            I hoped would be favorable—might be had before the Minister’s
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>I also explained to the Minister and to the Ambassador the reasons for
                            the exclusion of South American bids by the OPM<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d414fn3">Office of Production Management.</note> from the
                            bids requested for quantities of corned beef hash for national defense
                            purposes. I said that Argentine meat was not excluded but that tinned
                            Argentine beef would be purchased, and it was only because we desired to
                            utilize our own potatoes in the manufacture of the corned beef hash to
                            be made up that tinned corned beef hash was going to be purchased solely
                            from United States bidders.</p>

                        <p>5. Department’s telegram No. 4, January 9, 10 p.m. While I have not
                            discussed this matter directly with Bolivian officials it is my
                            impression that they would welcome plan outlined which dovetails closely
                            with plans and aspirations of committees set up by the Bolivian
                            Government to study aviation situation as reported in my despatch 553 of
                            December 31.<note n="1" xml:id="d417fn1">Not printed</note> If the
                            Department will authorize me I believe it would serve a useful purpose
                            for me to approach Bolivian officials and get a more concrete statement
                            of their wishes without of course intimating that we would necessarily
                            be prepared to further them.</p>
                        <p>Bolivian Government owns 48% of L.A.B. stock and with shares by
                            Government-owned Banco Central has 52% control and since could
                            presumably effect any desired reorganization.</p>

                            company is being definitely considered in connection with plan outlined

                            Panagra in the operation of air transport services within Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The company is disposed to send a representative (probably Vidal) to
                            Bolivia for the purpose of working out an acceptable plan with Bolivian
                            officials for replacing L.A.B. You should, of course, render all
                            appropriate assistance in the discussions with the Bolivian
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Please ascertain whether the Bolivian Government is agreeable, in
                            principle, to the working out of a plan for the reorganization of L.A.B.
                            or its replacement by a new company so that German influence and
                            management would be eliminated. Every effort would be made, of course,
                            to make the new service better than the existing service and in addition
                            to rendering technical assistance an opportunity would be afforded for
                            the training of Bolivian pilots and ground personnel.</p>
                        <p>For your information, Panagra’s representatives are disposed to favor a
                            plan which would call for the replacement of L.A.B. by a new Bolivian
                            company with which Panagra would cooperate by rendering technical
                            assistance, training of pilots, ground personnel, etc. Panagra officials
                            are of the opinion that the trunk line service between La Paz and the
                            Brazilian border could better be operated as an extension of the through
                            Panagra international system.</p>
                        <p>A copy of memorandum of the conference with Panagra representatives is
                            being sent you by air mail.</p>

                            Ostria Gutiérrez, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the desirability of
                            ascertaining definitely what action had been taken by the Bolivian

                            consideration of a plan for reorganization of L. A. B., left with the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs on February 20 in accordance with the
                            Department’s telegram No. 12 [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>] of February 18,
                            8 p.m., I directed an officer of the Legation to discuss the question
                            yesterday morning with Mr. Joaquín Espada, Minister of Finance, the
                            Cabinet officer who has taken most direct interest in the question of
                            dispensing with German influence in L. A. B. <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406"
                                facs="0416"/>Mr. Espada stated that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> had been submitted to the Cabinet meeting on
                            February 21, 1941, and that the Cabinet had agreed in principle to the
                            working out of a plan for the reorganization of L. A. B. or its
                            replacement by a new company with the elimination of German influence
                            and management and to welcome the sending of a representative of Pan
                            American–Grace Airways to try to work out an acceptable plan with the
                            appropriate Bolivian officials. Mr. Espada said that the sense of the
                            Cabinet meeting was that the Minister of Foreign Affairs should so
                            inform the Legation. While the officer of the Legation was in Mr.
                            Espada’s office, the latter telephoned to the Under Secretary of Foreign
                            Affairs to enquire whether the Minister of Foreign Affairs had not given
                            him instructions in this sense. The Under Secretary replied that he had
                            seen his Minister for only a few minutes between the Cabinet meeting and
                            his departure and that the matter had not been mentioned. The Minister
                            of Finance then stated to the officer of the Legation that he thought
                            his own statement that the Cabinet had agreed in principle to the
                            Department’s proposal could be taken as an informal answer pending the
                            return of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espada went on to say that the President was, of course, fully
                            informed of the program … He said that there was general agreement in
                            the Cabinet that German influence would have to be eliminated from L. A.
                            B. and that the only questions were as to the proper time to do so and
                            the exact method of procedure. He stated that General Carlos Blanco
                            Galindo, the Minister of Defense, had suggested that action be delayed
                            until after the report of the committee appointed by his Ministry to
                            investigate L. A. B. and the investigation by the Comptroller
                                General<note n="11" xml:id="d420fn2">José Alcides Molina.</note> of
                            L. A. B. finances had been completed in order to have full ammunition to
                            utilize against the present L. A. B. organization and that this was
                            agreed to. Mr. Espada added that the Comptroller General had gone to
                            Cochabamba, the headquarters of L. A. B., to try to obtain data.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espada then remarked that he thought it essential for a
                            representative of Pan American–Grace Airways, preferably Mr. Vidal since
                            he had dealt with the matter before and was fully conversant with it, to
                            come to La Paz promptly.…</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espada went at some length into the question of what form
                            reorganization of L. A. B. services should take in his opinion. He said
                            that the so-called international service of L. A. B., from La Paz to the
                            Brazilian border should be turned over to Pan American–Grace Airways to
                            run direct as part of its lines and that he hoped for an adequate United
                            States Government subsidy for this line so that it could be properly
                            run.</p>
                        <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>On the question of the rest of the services of L. A. B., Mr. Espada said
                            that there would have to be complete reorganization. He remarked that
                            the equipment of the company was completely obsolete and that three
                            modern planes would be necessary for adequate service. He said that he
                            hoped it would be possible to obtain these through the good offices of
                            the United States Government and mentioned a loan. He added that it was
                            the intention to continue the present subsidy to L. A. B. which, he
                            thought, would be sufficient for the operation of the domestic lines on
                            a proper basis but not to make the lump sum capital investment involved
                            in securing three new planes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espada then stated that the Deutsche Lufthansa had offered three
                            planes but had made conditions whereby new stock in L. A. B. would be
                            issued to it for their value. This would result in complete German
                            control over the company which was exactly what he and the Bolivian
                            Government in general wished to avoid.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espada terminated by saying that all of these problems required
                            careful consideration with someone qualified to present concrete
                            proposals on behalf of Pan American–Grace Airways with the backing of
                            the United States Government in order that a definite program might be
                            worked out and that for these reasons he thought that Mr. Vidal’s prompt
                            arrival in La Paz was most desirable. He remarked that the actual
                            mechanics of reorganizing or replacing L. A. B. could be worked out
                            after a plan for operation had been decided upon.</p>
                        <p>As I have stated in previous despatches, it seems to me that the
                            essential thing is for the Department and Pan American–Grace Airways to
                            come to a decision as to what can be done and then be prepared to push
                            the matter through to a conclusion.… I consequently feel that a decision
                            in Washington as to what can be offered to the Bolivian Government and
                            the return of Mr. Vidal in the near future to work on such a program as
                            may be agreed upon are advisable.</p>

                                    Minister preferred former but seemed willing to consider latter

                                    all to be loan as originally suggested. Pan American–Grace-owned

                        <p>At the end of meeting President said that plan was acceptable in
                            principle and asked for submission of detailed plan in writing,
                            negotiations appear to be progressing satisfactorily. Major obstacle
                            which may arise is question of stock ownership by Panagra. It envisages
                            stock control while Government will probably want to retain majority
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>If disagreement on stock control develops it might be possible to solve
                            it by (1) having Panagra give Government option to buy stock after
                            period of years, or (2) Panagra’s making straight loan taking stock as
                            collateral and voting it until loan is amortized.</p>
                        <p>Advisable that plan be presented as soon as possible. Vidal is asking for
                            prompt instructions from New York. Request advice as to whether changes
                            meet with Department’s approval and any comments on stock control
                            question.</p>

                            Manager of W. E. Grace and Company, President and Minister of

                            are insisting on placing control over civil and commercial aviation in
                            Ministry of Defense by decree instead of Ministry of Communications.</p>
                        <p>Understand that Manager of W. E. Grace and Company and Calloway<note
                                n="30" xml:id="d426fn3">L.C. Calloway.</note> in charge of Lloyd
                            Aéreo Boliviano reorganization have recommended to Harris, Vice
                            President of Panagra, by telephone that military control should be
                            tacitly accepted without further opposition and that Harris indicated
                            general agreeement.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully suggest that the Department consult Federal Loan Agency and
                            Panagra and inform Legation whether it desires any formal
                            representations to be made on ground that failure to place civil and
                            commercial aviation under Ministry of Communications might be construed
                            as a unilateral violation of agreement between Federal Loan Agency and
                            Bolivian Government for reorganization of Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano.</p>
                        <p>I doubt whether such representations would be effective and am inclined
                            to think we should make no comment at this time. If military control
                            proves unsatisfactory the matter can always be taken up on the practical
                            basis of actual points of difficulty.</p>

                                notes resulted from conversations between the Chief of Staff of the
                                Bolivian Army and the representative of the General Staff of the
                                United States Army. Five points of agreement were indicated in the

                                Affairs, Dr. Alberto Ostria Gutiérrez, as follows: (1) to combat the
                                influence of subversive groups Bolivia agreed to increase the
                                supervision of non-American elements; (2) to exchange information
                                with the United States on defense matters and subversive activities;
                                (3) to consider the presence of non-American military missions as
                                incompatible with continental solidarity; (4) to facilitate the
                                entry into action of United States forces in case they go to the aid
                                of Bolivia by guarding routes of entry, maintaining order, and
                                making facilities available; and (5) to continue bilateral
                                conversations on defense. In his reply of October 30 Ostria
                                Gutierrez expressed a willingness to rescind the contract of the
                                Italian military mission provided the United States would detail a
                                mission of aviation officers, and agreement in principle to

                        <p>In paragraph 3 of his note, Mr. Jenkins<note n="35" xml:id="d428fn3"

                            pleased to request the expression of opinion of my Government as to “the

                            the perfect realization of continental solidarity.” In my Government’s
                            opinion, a merely affirmative reply was not proper, since it would have
                            implied the immediate cancellation of the contract of the only
                            non-American <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0423"/>military mission
                            in Bolivia without any provision to compensate for the damage.<note
                                n="36" xml:id="d428fn4">In a conversation of December 28, 1940, with
                                Mr. Orme Wilson, State Department Liaison Officer, the Bolivian
                                Minister indicated that since his country would have the expense of
                                indemnifying the Italian Mission for the cancellation of its
                                contract, the United States should bear the expense of the American
                                Mission (824.248/131½).</note></p>
                        <p>Hence, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in reply, made the following
                            explanation: “There is in Bolivia one military mission of Italian
                            origin. It renders its services, which are exclusively for military
                            instruction, in the Escuela de Armas of the city of Cochabamba.
                            According to its contract, it is to remain in Bolivia for a period of
                            seven more years. In spite of the simply pedagogical character of this
                            mission, the Government of Bolivia is willing to cancel its contract;
                            but in such case it would wish the Army of the United States of America
                            to detail a mission of aviation officers to replace the Italian mission
                            and to come equipped with the respective machines for instruction. The
                            Government of Bolivia considers that in this way real technical
                            cooperation on the part of the United States of America would be
                            effected.”</p>
                        <p>On this plane of real cooperation to which the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs of Bolivia refers, I have the honor to request of Your
                            Excellency that you will kindly recommend to the War Department careful
                            consideration of the present representation and obtain its opinion
                            respecting the technical and economic collaboration which it can give in
                            this circumstance.</p>
                        <p>On this occasion I am very happy to renew to Your Excellency [etc.]</p>

                            the request of your Government for a military mission consisting of
                            aviation instructors and such additional personnel as may be necessary
                            for the purpose of sending appropriate assistance to the Bolivian
                            military authorities in strengthening the air forces of the Bolivian

                        <p>In your communication of January 2, you invite my attention to the
                            existence of an Italian Military Mission in Bolivia, and to the request
                            expressed by the United States Minister at La Paz for an opinion of your
                            Government in regard to the incompatibility of the presence of <pb

                            with the realization of continental solidarity. I have duly noted your
                            statement that your Government is willing to cancel the existing
                            contract with the Italian Military Mission, but that in return it
                            desires the United States War Department to send to Bolivia a mission of
                            aviation officers equipped with the necessary airplanes for purposes of
                            instruction. Your Government considers that this would constitute a
                            genuine technical cooperation of the United States with Bolivia and, in
                            this connection, you request me to obtain from the War Department its
                            views respecting the technical and economic collaboration which might be
                            rendered to your Government.</p>

                            transmit to the War Department the desire of your Government to obtain
                            an aviation mission. That Department has, as you are aware, directed
                            Major Weddington to proceed to La Paz in order to study the technical
                            aspects of the proposed mission. This Department will also be glad to
                            invite the attention of the War Department to the question of economic
                            collaboration indicated above, and will communicate to you such views as
                            the competent military authorities may desire to express on these
                            subjects.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that two
                            additional members of the Italian military mission to Bolivia have
                            recently arrived in the country and taken up duties as instructors in
                            the Military Academy at La Paz. These officers are a Colonel Matteoti, a
                            General Staff officer, until recently head of the Italian military
                            mission in Ecuador, and Lieutenant Colonel Pietro Antonio, a Field
                            Artilleryman, also a member of that mission. The Legation understands
                            that the contract of the mission in Ecuador was canceled by the
                            Ecuadoran Government several months ago at the instance of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that in connection with the staff conversations which
                            took place in Bolivia in September and October 1940, a note dated
                            October 8, 1940,<note n="38" xml:id="d430fn1">Not printed.</note> was
                            presented to the Bolivian Foreign Office by the Legation inquiring
                            whether the Bolivian Government was disposed to agree to five points,
                            including: <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0425"/>

                        <p>It will also be recalled that the Foreign Office’s reply, dated October
                            30, 1940,<note n="39" xml:id="d430fn2">Not printed.</note> answered this
                            point as follows, in translation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“3. There is in Bolivia only one military mission, of Italian
                                    origin. Its services are devoted exclusively to military
                                    instruction in the War College in the city of Cochabamba.
                                    According to its contract it should remain in Bolivia for seven
                                    years more. Despite the purely pedagogical character of this
                                    mission, the Government of Bolivia is prepared to rescind its
                                    contract; but in such case it would desire the Army of the
                                    United States of America to detail a mission of aviation
                                    officers to replace the Italian mission and which would come
                                    provided with the necessary training planes. The Government of
                                    Bolivia considers that a true technical cooperation on the part
                                    of the United States of America would thus be carried out.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The addition of two new members of the Italian military mission to the
                            eleven who were previously on duty in Bolivia, particularly in view of
                            the fact that the two new ones were members of a mission whose contract
                            with another American Republic was canceled, would hardly seem
                            compatible with the Bolivian Government’s expressed willingness to
                            dispense with the services of those already in Bolivia last October.
                            This seems especially true at a time when the Bolivian Government is
                            negotiating for an American Army air mission.</p>
                        <p>The Military Attaché of the Legation two days ago inquired of General
                            Felipe Rivera, Superintendent of the Military Academy, concerning the
                            status of Col. Matteoti and Lt. Col. Antonio. Gen. Rivera who was the
                            Bolivian Army’s senior representative in the recent trip to the United
                            States of Latin American Chiefs of Staff and others at the invitation of
                            General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army,
                            and who has been among the Bolivian Army officers most friendly to the
                            United States, stated that he had been glad to secure the services of
                            the two Italian officers as they were competent and spoke good Spanish
                            while he was short of qualified instructors and had been unsuccessful in
                            getting the General Staff to assign qualified Bolivian officers to his
                            teaching corps. Gen. Rivera added that the two Italian officers could be
                            considered replacements rather than additions since two Italians who had
                            orignally been intended for assignment to the Military Academy at the
                            time of the appointment of the original Italian mission had died before
                            proceeding to Bolivia.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_416" facs="0426"/>in a Military Academy which produces
                            second lieutenants and is roughly equivalent, although of course
                            inferior, to West Point is not clear to the Legation. The other members
                            of the Italian military mission are instructors in the War College at
                            Cochabamba which is the nearest Bolivian counterpart to the Command and
                            Staff School at Fort Leavenworth and the Army War College at
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian Army’s action in taking on two additional Italian
                            instructors in contravention of at least the spirit of commitments the
                            Bolivian Government has expressed itself as ready to make seems another
                            indication that such commitments for military cooperation may be of
                            little value …</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the State and War Departments will wish to make
                            certain that the services of the Italian military mission are dispensed
                            with before entering into any contract for the supplying of a United
                            States Army air mission since this is understood to be the general
                            policy in such cases and since it appears that the War Department
                            considers the presence of totalitarian military missions in Latin
                            America a menace to continental defense regardless of whether American
                            missions substitute for them or not. Opposition to canceling the Italian
                            contract may arise in Bolivian Army circles because of the fact that it
                            is apparently only contemplated that we will send two Air Corps officers
                            and there are thirteen Italians now here on duty … As mentioned in
                            previous correspondence, there is a further flaw in the matter in that
                            the Bolivian reply to our question as to the utilization of non-American
                            military missions in the sense that the Bolivian Government is ready to
                            rescind the Italian mission’s contract seems to be conditional on the
                            supplying not only of an air mission by the United States but also of
                            training planes; it is understood from a letter received by me from
                            Major General Frank M. Andrews that the recommendations of Major Harry
                            Weddington, sent by the War Department to Bolivia to investigate
                            Bolivian needs as regards an air mission, and approved by Gen. Andrews,
                            called for one bi-motored plane for the mission with training for a
                            small cadre of Bolivian officers to be carried out in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to me that the Department may wish me to make some form of
                            representation to the Bolivian Government in regard to the hiring of two
                            additional Italian military instructors, particularly in view of the
                            circumstances. Should this be the case, I should appreciate appropriate
                            instructions.</p>

                            to your notes of December 14, 1940<note n="40" xml:id="d431fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> and January 2, 1941, conveying the request of your
                            Government for a United States military aviation mission, and to inform
                            you that my Government is prepared to furnish such a mission.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed that the War Department has now two officers and two
                            noncommissioned officers available for this mission, which would be
                            provided with one bimotored plane. It is the understanding of the War
                            Department that it is agreeable to your Government that these two
                            officers be commissioned in the Bolivian Army one grade higher than
                            their present rank and that the noncommissioned officers be commissioned
                            as second lieutenants, all four to receive the same pay and allowances
                            as officers of the Bolivian Army of the same rank. It is the
                            understanding of the War Department that in addition to the
                            aforementioned amount these officers will receive as flying pay eighty
                            percent of the base pay they receive from Bolivia. It would be
                            appreciated if you could confirm this understanding.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving word from you that the above arrangement is acceptable to
                            your Government I shall be pleased to forward to you without delay a
                            draft agreement similar to the standard form of agreement which this
                            Government has adopted to cover all United States military or naval
                            missions in the other American republics.</p>
                        <p>In view of the reference in your note of January 2, 1941 to the
                            cancelation of the contract covering the Italian Military Mission at
                            present in Bolivia I assume that this contract will be canceled before
                            the arrival of a United States military aviation mission. I would
                            appreciate confirmation of this.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to previous
                            correspondence, particularly the Legation’s despatch No. 840 of May 21,
                                1941,<note n="43" xml:id="d433fn1">See footnote 41, <ref
                                    target="#pg_417">p. 417</ref>.</note> in regard to the sending
                            of a United States Army air mission to Bolivia and the elimination of
                            the Italian military mission now in the country as a condition thereto.
                            It will be recalled that, in a communication dated May 16, 1941,<note
                                n="44" xml:id="d433fn2"><ref target="#pg_418"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Ante</hi>, p. 418</ref>.</note> the Bolivian Minister of
                            Defense informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Italian
                            mission would conclude its functions at the expiration of the military
                            scholastic year, in October 1941 (a copy and translation of this
                            document were transmitted as enclosures Nos. 2 and 5 to the despatch
                            under reference).</p>
                        <p>In view of this commitment and the fact that the period specified for the
                            termination of the services of the Italian mission is at hand, I have
                            made discreet inquiries to ascertain what steps are being taken to get
                            rid of the mission. So far as I have been able to discover, nothing has
                            been done in regard to the matter. In the course of a conversation this
                            afternoon on other matters with the Minister of Defense, General Miguel
                            Candia, I brought the question up but he evaded a direct answer, saying
                            merely that he had communicated with the Bolivian Minister in
                            Washington, Mr. Luis F. Guachalla, on the subject.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>A deputy, Mr. Jacinto Rodríguez, who at the outbreak of the European War
                            requested the cancellation of the contract of the Italian military
                            mission, presented a “petición de informe” yesterday asking the Minister
                            of Defense what reasons there might be for the failure to cancel the
                            contract especially in view of the fact that Italy is at war and of the
                            sizable expenditure by the Bolivian Government under the terms of the
                            contract. Under the parliamentary rules in vogue in Bolivia, the
                            Minister of Defense will have to make a written reply to the “petición
                            de informe” and this reply may clarify the matter.</p>
                        <p>Even if steps are taken to rescind the Italian contract, the members of
                            the mission are likely to be a problem in the future. While the contract
                            has been running, they have devoted themselves moderately well to their
                            tasks without engaging in any great amount of propaganda. However, once
                            they are idle and without the incentive of their pay from the Bolivian
                            Government to keep them more or less in line, they may become a menace
                            unless some steps can be taken to send them back to Italy or at least
                            get them out of Bolivia.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>The Italian Military Attaché in Buenos Aires, Lt. Colonel Alberto L.
                            Osti, who is also assigned to the Italian Legation in La Paz, has been
                            here for the past two weeks. His presence may have something to do with
                            General Candia’s apparent desire to have the stay of the Italian
                            military mission prolonged. Colonel Osti has succeeded in making a large
                            circle of acquaintances among Bolivian army officers in the short time
                            he has been here. General Candia gave him a large party yesterday which
                            appears a little strange in view of the General’s supposed democratic
                            sympathies. No comparable festivities have been given for military
                            attachés of neutral countries by recent Ministers of Defence.</p>
                        <p>It would be helpful if the Legation could be advised concerning any
                            recent conversations which the Bolivian Minister in Washington may have
                            had with officers of the Department regarding the termination of the
                            services of the Italian military mission to Bolivia. Similarly,
                            instructions would be appreciated as to what representations, if any,
                            the Department desires the Legation to make should no steps have been
                            taken for the cancellation of the mission’s contract by October 31,
                            1941.</p>

                        <p>312. Department’s 216, October 31, 5 p.m. Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            informed me this afternoon that Cabinet had decided on immediate
                            cancellation of contract of Italian military mission but that Minister
                            of War desired to retain three members of it on new private contracts to
                            continue teaching mapping, drawing, et cetera, in staff college at
                            Cochabamba as there were no substitutes available. He <pb n="421"

                            forwarded when received. I feel that retention of any members of Italian
                            military mission in whatever capacity is objectionable and respectfully
                            recommend that the Department insist on Bolivian Government’s keeping
                            fully to its commitment. It might be possible for substitute instructors
                            to be furnished by the United States Army as an additional military

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in the
                            course of a conversation this morning when I took Lieutenant Colonel
                            Edward H. Porter, Chief of the United States Army Aviation Mission to
                            Bolivia, to pay his protocol visit on the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            (while Colonel Porter and the junior members of the Mission arrived on
                            November 25, he has been ill and was unable to make his visits until
                            today), the latter advised me that he had informed the Italian
                            Government, through the Italian Legation in La Paz and the Bolivian
                            Legation in Rome, that the services of the Italian Military Mission to
                            Bolivia would be terminated this month. On my inquiring exactly when
                            these services would end, the Minister stated that this would be after
                            the examinations finishing the military school year which he thought was
                            just before Christmas.</p>
                        <p>When Lieutenant Colonel Clarence W. Bennett, the Military Attaché of the
                            Legation, took Col. Porter to call on the Minister of War this afternoon
                            the subject of the Italian Military Mission was also aired. The Minister
                            of War stated that the termination of the services of the Mission was a
                            question which had been definitely settled and that he was going to
                            Cochabamba, where the Mission is stationed, in the course of the next
                            two or three days to tell its members that their services were to end
                            after the examinations and to arrange details.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of War again expressed interest in the possibility of
                            securing the services of United States Army officers to replace some of
                            the Italian officers as instructors in courses in the Bolivian Staff
                            College at Cochabamba. Col. Bennett told him that, if a request were
                            made through the Bolivian Minister in Washington, he was sure careful
                            and sympathetic consideration would be given to it.<note n="46"
                                xml:id="d436fn1">A formal request was made by the Bolivian Legation
                                on February 14, 1942, and on April 9, 1942, the Department of State
                                informed the Legation that the War Department had concluded that
                                four officers could meet the request for instructors. (824.20/189,

                            an American Army Mission of this character, it would be helpful to have
                            in advance of the formal request an indication of the exact curriculum
                            which each officer would be expected to cover in his courses so that it
                            might be ascertained as soon as possible whether qualified officers
                            would be available.</p>

                        <p>106. The Department on July 17 handed to the Bolivian Minister a draft of
                            basic agreement for the lend-lease program of transferring military
                            matériel to Bolivia. The principal financial provisions are as follows:
                            Bolivia is to receive a total of $8,000,000 of military matériel of
                            which it is expected $2,000,000 will be transferred during the fiscal
                            year ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to change if
                            broad defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Bolivia is expected to pay $250,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947 making a total of $1,500,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the
                            program and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire
                            obligation of Bolivia to the United States would be considered
                            discharged by such payments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 106 of July 19, 1941, concerning the proposal
                            to transfer certain military equipment to Bolivia under the Lend-Lease
                            Program and to report that President Enrique Peñaranda brought this
                            matter up during a conversation I had with him at the Presidential
                            Palace yesterday morning. I called on the President at his request and
                            was accompanied <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0433"/>by Mr.
                                Pool<note n="48" xml:id="d438fn1">John Cochran Pool, Vice Consul and
                                Third Secretary of Legation.</note> of the Legation. Dr. Joaquín
                            Espada, the Minister of Finance, came in soon after the President
                            received us and took part in the conversation.</p>
                        <p>President Peñaranda said that he felt Bolivia should receive a larger
                            quantity of matériel than had been promised under the Lend-Lease Program
                            and he asked me to do what I could to induce our authorities in
                            Washington to take a more favorable attitude to Bolivia in this
                            connection. He referred to the fact that Chile, Peru and other
                            neighboring countries were to receive a great deal more than Bolivia,
                            saying he felt this was not quite fair to this country.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to General Peñaranda that I was sure the plan for
                            distributing military matériel to our South American neighbors had been
                            prepared with the greatest care and only after consultation and study
                            with the representatives of the countries concerned. I had not been
                            informed, I said, but I was under the impression that the matériel to go
                            to each country was based on the standing army of the government
                            concerned and for this reason I assumed Bolivia’s quota would not be as
                            much as that of Chile or Peru perhaps, but probably more than the amount
                            to be received by some of the other countries.</p>
                        <p>To this, President Peñaranda replied that a country’s strength did not
                            depend on its standing army but rather on the troops it could put in the
                            field and that Bolivia could be counted on to raise an army equal to
                            that of any of the other countries mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The President then handed me a list of matériel which he felt Bolivia
                            should have and which he said he hoped our Government would be willing
                            to supply under the Lend-Lease Plan. A translation of this memorandum

                        <p>Of course I told the President that I would immediately transmit the list
                            and the substance of his remarks to Washington where I was sure they
                            would receive careful consideration. I added, however, that <pb n="424"
                                xml:id="pg_424" facs="0434"/>as he doubtless knew our Government was
                            doing everything it could at present to supply England and certain other
                            countries fighting for the democracies and I did not know whether the
                            responsible authorities in Washington would feel it possible to increase
                            the quota of military matériel set aside for Bolivia. The President said
                            he understood this but hoped Bolivia’s quota could be raised in relation
                            to the neighboring South American countries.</p>
                        <p>The Department may be interested to know that Colonel Moscoso, the
                            Bolivian Military Attaché in Washington who is now back in La Paz on
                            leave, called to see me a few days ago and, in the course of the
                            conversation, he brought up the fact that Bolivia did not seem to be
                            getting the war matériel under the Lend-Lease Plan to which he thought
                            it was entitled. He added, however, that this was only his personal
                            opinion and that he had not said anything about the matter to our
                            authorities in Washington.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>President Peñaranda went on to say that he was convinced the Germans
                            intended to gain control of Bolivia first and use it as a point from
                            which to extend their influence by infiltration or other means to the
                            neighboring South American countries. He said recent political events in
                            Bolivia and elsewhere tended to confirm this and pointed out the natural
                            advantages offered by the Bolivian terrain for airplane landing fields
                            as well as the strategical central position Bolivia occupies in this
                            continent. He asserted very positively that Bolivia had definitely
                            embarked on a pro-American and pro-democratic policy against the Nazi
                            and totalitarian states.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation with President Peñaranda, I referred to
                            the proposed American aviation mission<note n="49" xml:id="d438fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#pg_412">pp. 412</ref> ff.</note> and asked the
                            President if the Government still felt the need of this mission without
                            delay. To this, the President replied most emphatically that he hoped
                            our aviation mission would be sent down as soon as possible and pointed
                            out that in his memorandum the mission of United States army aviation
                            instructors had been specifically mentioned.</p>
                        <p>While I am quite sure, as a layman, that the allotment of military
                            supplies has already been carefully worked out by our military
                            authorities and that no general increase will be feasible, it has
                            occurred to me that consideration might possibly be given to expanding
                            and improving the aviation department of this country. As the Department
                            knows, Bolivia possesses only one or two military planes that can be
                            flown at present and it is evident that serious attention should be
                            devoted to the training and organization of the aviation arm. This would
                            probably cost less money than a supply of tanks and artillery and would
                            be more effective in case of need.</p>

                        <p>This afternoon I received a call from the Bolivian Minister who was
                            accompanied by Colonel Moscoso. Dr. Guachalla said that Bolivia was
                            anxious to have the amount to be received during the first year
                            increased beyond $2,000,000. He told me that he had mentioned this
                            matter to Mr. Welles, who had told him that the important factor
                            involved was what war materials could be made available; that this
                            matter was more pertinent than the actual sum of money desired.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated he now had a list of the armaments desired by his
                            Government, and that he wished to show this list to the appropriate
                            authorities in order to determine (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) whether
                            Bolivia would be able to receive more the first year, and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) whether Bolivia could get a larger total
                            figure. In the latter connection, he referred to the conversation which
                            the American Minister at La Paz had had with President Peñaranda, in the
                            course of which the latter had said Bolivia hoped to receive more
                            military equipment under the Lend-Lease program (despatch no. 973, July
                            30, from La Paz).</p>
                        <p>I explained to Dr. Guachalla the difficulties involved in granting
                            anything more to Bolivia than had already been communicated; i. e., the
                            problems the War Department is faced with in this connection, such as
                            the demands of Great Britain, Russia, et cetera. I said that I would be
                            glad to arrange an appointment, if possible for tomorrow, for the
                            Minister and Colonel Moscoso with the War Department.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned the Bolivian Minister that an appointment had been arranged
                            for him tomorrow afternoon at the War Department with Major Johnston of
                            the Defense Aid Division.</p>
                        <p>In speaking to Major Johnston about this, I was informed that it would
                            probably be impossible to either increase the total amount for Bolivia
                            or the amount to be received by that country during the first year.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in the
                            course of a conversation I had yesterday with Dr. Alberto Ostria
                            Gutiérrez, Minister of Foreign Affairs, he mentioned the deplorable
                            condition of rolling stock on the Bolivian Government railways and
                            expressed the hope that it <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0436"
                            />would be possible for our Government to lend its assistance in this
                            matter. The Minister referred to the proposed $8,000,000 loan to this
                            country for military purposes and said that it would be much more
                            helpful to Bolivia if a part of this credit could be earmarked for
                            locomotives instead of armaments. He added that these engines would be
                            just as essential, if not in fact a little more so, than guns and
                            ammunition.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez that I would be glad to bring the substance
                            of his remarks to the attention of the Department for such consideration
                            as might be deemed feasible, and asked him how many locomotives he
                            thought would be needed to put the local railways in a reasonably
                            efficient condition. The Minister replied that this entire question had
                            been under recent discussion in the Cabinet and it was understood that
                            ten locomotives would be required as a minimum.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez told me that President Peñaranda was gravely
                            concerned over the situation and had authorized him to speak to me about
                            it. The shortage of food supplies in many districts which was causing
                            discontent and threats of strikes and other disorders, Dr. Ostria
                            Gutiérrez said, was the direct result of the breakdown in railway
                            communications and the consequent inability of the authorities to bring
                            into the country foodstuffs and other supplies absolutely necessary for
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>After my conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I called on
                            Mr. William A. Pickwoad, general manager of the British-owned
                            Antofagasta-Bolivian Railway, and asked for his opinion in regard to
                            what Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez had told me. Mr. Pickwoad said it was
                            perfectly true that the Government lines in Bolivia were in desperate
                            need of locomotives and that his railway was lending them some engines
                            and cars to help out, but of course this was only a stop-gap and could
                            not be continued indefinitely. Mr. Pickwoad pointed out that all of the
                            railway lines in Bolivia were of the meter gauge. He said the Baldwin
                            Locomotive Works in the United States had filled orders for engines of
                            this sort in Brazil in the past and could no doubt do the same thing for
                            Bolivia. He then offered to write me a letter in detail in regard to the
                            matter, and a copy of this communication is attached to this
                                despatch.<note n="50" xml:id="d440fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>If at all feasible, it would appear to be a wise step for the responsible
                            authorities in Washington to consider applying a part of the $8,000,000
                            credit mentioned for the purchase of some, if not all, of the
                            locomotives reported by Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez and Mr. Pickwoad to be so
                            badly needed.</p>

                        <p>The Minister<note n="51" xml:id="d441fn1">Luis Fernando Guachalla, the
                                Bolivian Minister.</note> permitted me to read a brief telegram from
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs instructing him to endeavor to secure an
                            increase of $1,000,000 in the amount of the allocation for armament
                            under the lend-lease program to purchase ten locomotives. If it is
                            impossible to increase the allocation then inquiry is made as to whether
                            $1,000,000 of the total allocation for Bolivia could be diverted for the
                            purchase of ten locomotives.</p>
                        <p>I reminded the Minister that the lend-lease agreement provided for the
                            delivery of “armament and munitions of war”. By no stretch of the
                            imagination could locomotives for Bolivia be considered either as
                            armament or as munitions of war. I told the Minister that he would
                            recall, however, that this Government, in its proposal for economic
                                collaboration,<note n="52" xml:id="d441fn2">For correspondence
                                concerning a proposed program for economic cooperation between the

                                ff.</note> had suggested a study of Bolivia’s communication needs,
                            which, of course, included railroads. I suggested the possibility of a
                            railroad engineer being sent to Bolivia competent, if possible, not only
                            to inspect the condition of the locomotives but also to advise on
                            Bolivia’s railroad problems in general.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he himself, prior to coming to see me, had
                            examined the lend-lease text and was prepared for the answer that I had
                            given him. He thought the suggestion I made a good one and hoped that it
                            would be acted upon.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that the question would be looked into at once and I
                            would try to give him a reply tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>The Minister of Bolivia came in to state that he had written his
                            Government by air mail asking permission for him to return to Bolivia
                            for a brief consultation. If permission is granted he intends to leave
                            the United States on December 15, arriving in La Paz about January 3. He
                            would leave La Paz at the end of January, arriving <pb n="428"
                                xml:id="pg_428" facs="0438"/>in Washington about the time that he

                        <p>The Minister stated that prior to his departure he would like to clear up
                            a number of matters of pending business.</p>
                        <p>1. He said that the lend-lease contract with Bolivia had not been signed
                            due to the fact that the Department was taking up with the War
                            Department the possibility of increasing Bolivia’s total allocation from
                            $8,000,000 to $11,000,000. I told the Minister that the Department had
                            just heard from the War Department that the increase desired had been
                            granted, so that there was now no reason why the lend-lease contract
                            could not be signed at once.</p>

                        <p>375. Since outbreak of hostilities it has been obvious that Bolivians
                            hope for maximum of concessions from the United States in return for
                            such aid as they give us. This has taken form of suggestions by Minister
                            of Finance that tin and tungsten contracts might be modified to
                            Bolivia’s advantage and statements by Minister of Foreign Affairs to
                            officer of Legation that Bolivia needed economic help immediately
                            (despite facts that economic mission is about to commence full
                            activities and that this is one Latin American country in better
                            financial position than at outbreak of European war). It is epitomized
                            in public statement of ex-Minister of Finance that Bolivia should
                            “negotiate cooperation”.</p>
                        <p>I have endeavored discreetly to insinuate to Foreign Minister and some of
                            his predecessors that best way for Bolivia to secure economic help was
                            to take firm stand by our side, at least breaking off relations with
                            Axis Powers. Brother of Minister at Washington tells me that latter has
                            recommended break with Axis. At meeting called December 11th, of
                            ex-Foreign Ministers to advise Minister of Foreign Affairs all but one
                            were in favor of breach of relations and Minister expressed
                            agreement.</p>

                            has not previously been included in Lend-Lease requests because it had

                                    If armed locally these should be as effective in controlling

                            had sent to Señor Paz Estenssoro, to the effect that the United States
                            was prepared to consider a program of economic assistance to Bolivia
                            without a prior or accompanying settlement of the Standard Oil

                        <p>The Minister stated that this telegram had provoked considerable
                            discussion in La Paz. The opposition was making it appear as though the
                            visit of Salamanca and Prudencio had resulted in a change in the
                            Department’s attitude, that these two deputies had accomplished more in
                            their brief visit to the United States than had the Bolivian Government
                            and its Minister in Washington in more than a year.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he knew that neither Mr. Welles<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d447fn3">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State.</note> nor
                            I had given these gentlemen to understand anything different than what
                            had been conveyed to him from time to time. He would like to make two
                            points clear: In the first place, the Bolivian Government had endeavored
                            to secure credits from this Government but had failed because of the
                            Standard Oil problem. The Minister referred particularly to the
                            negotiations carried on by the Minister of Foreign Affairs with Mr.
                            Welles in Panama in September, 1939.<note n="63a" xml:id="d447fn4">For

                            stated that the same point of view had also been indicated to him from
                            time to time by the Under Secretary, by Dr. Feis,<note n="64"
                                xml:id="d447fn5">Herbert Feis, Adviser on International Economic
                                Affairs.</note> and by me. In the second place, the Minister desired
                            to remind the Department that it was he who had suggested, practically a
                            year ago, that this Government make certain credits without exacting any
                            commitment with regard to the Standard Oil question. He had suggested
                            this Government grant Export-Import Bank credits to permit the financing
                            of the Santa Cruz railroad.<note n="65" xml:id="d447fn6">For

                            down. On the contrary, he had stated that the first step was to have a
                            detailed survey of the route in order to ascertain how much credit would
                            be necessary. This attitude of Mr. Welles’ and the <pb n="435"
                                xml:id="pg_435" facs="0445"/>subsequent making of the survey gave
                            the Bolivian Government grounds to believe that, at the opportune
                            moment, credits would be forthcoming, even though the Standard Oil
                            question had not been settled.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister that I was sorry if his Government or he had been
                            placed in an embarrassing position because of Señor Salamanca’s
                            telegram. I said that he was quite correct in his assumption that
                            nothing had been told Señor Salamanca that had not been repeated
                            frequently to the Minister. I said that, after his last call on Mr.
                            Welles, the latter had requested that the Bolivian situation be
                            reviewed. I explained that a memorandum had been drawn up and was about
                            to be presented to Mr. Welles which would suggest various new approaches
                            to the problem. I told the Minister that I would let him know as soon as
                            a decision had been arrived at but indicated that, in a case of this
                            kind, a decision not only of the Department but also of the Federal Loan
                                Administrator<note n="66" xml:id="d447fn7">Jesse H. Jones.</note>
                            might be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he would withhold compliance with new
                            instructions which he had just received, to present a request for a
                            $36,000,000 loan. Of the total amount, $30,000,000 would be used for the
                            Santa Cruz railroad, $3,000,000 for stabilization purposes, and
                            $3,000,000 for miscellaneous public works including certain road
                            construction. The Minister volunteered the information that, since the
                            last conversation, he had been thinking over my suggestion that, instead
                            of investing such a large amount of money in a railroad which would help
                            only one section of the country, it would be far better to build a
                            highway network that would tie the country together and help all
                            parts.</p>

                            hereafter was handed to the Bolivian Minister here today. The Minister
                            stated that he would send it by air mail at once to the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs and would request from him a cabled reply as to the
                            views of his Government. In view of the desire of the Bolivian Minister

                                    might appropriately be included in a long-term plan of
                                    collaboration to foster continued mutually beneficial economic

                                <item>2. It is believed that the basis of such a plan must be in the

                                    including certain railway facilities. The report of the United

                                    construction of such a railway, but suggests as an alternative
                                    consideration of the construction of a highway joining the two
                                    points. It is believed that a decision regarding a long-term
                                    program for the development of communications in Bolivia can
                                    best be taken after a general survey by competent engineers. The
                                    Bolivian Government has recently inquired concerning the
                                    possibility of a general survey by highway experts, and there is
                                    attached a memorandum<note n="68" xml:id="d448fn3">Not

                                <item>3. The development of communications should encourage an
                                    expansion and diversification of agricultural production in
                                    Bolivia, involving both an increased degree of self-sufficiency
                                    and perhaps the development of certain tropical products for
                                    export. It is believed that this development might be
                                    advantageously speeded up and assisted by a comprehensive survey
                                    of the several potentially important agricultural regions of
                                    Bolivia. The Government of the United States is prepared at the
                                    request of the Bolivian Government to detail competent
                                    agricultural experts to carry out such a survey in cooperation
                                    with the Bolivian authorities.</item>
                                <item>4. It has been suggested that it may be feasible and desirable
                                    to stimulate production of tin, tungsten and certain other
                                    minerals in Bolivia of small miners by assisting them in
                                    improving their methods, providing them with appropriate
                                    machinery, and possibly erecting a reduction plant for the
                                    treatment of low-grade tin ores. Such possibilities of course
                                    would require careful study, and the Government of the United
                                    States would be glad to consider any request that may be made by
                                    the Government of Bolivia for the services of a qualified

                                    projects which are considered desirable, useful, and practicable

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 127 of August 8 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>], 3
                            p.m., and to the Legation’s telegram No. 199 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >191</hi>] of August 12, 2 p.m., both with reference to the proposed
                            plan for economic cooperation between the American and Bolivian
                            Governments, and to report the general reaction in Bolivia to the
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The proposal has made, generally speaking, a very favorable impression,
                            the only unfortunate repercussion thus far having been what may turn out
                            to be a somewhat over-optimistic anticipation of the amount involved in
                            the loan to be made by the United States Government. Although the text
                            of the general memorandum transmitted to the Bolivian Government made no
                            mention of any specific amount the supplementary memorandum concerning a
                            possible survey of potential highways has been rather generally
                            misinterpreted as being an outline of actual intended construction. On
                            the basis of this, Cabinet discussions at first apparently centered
                            around the maximum survey figure of 11,400 kilometers, involving an
                            outlay of $120,000,000, but have now been moderated to the more
                            reasonable figure of 5,000 kilometers <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438"
                                facs="0448"/>mentioned later in the memorandum, for which a loan of
                            $25,000,000 is deemed necessary. It is also being assumed that another
                            large sum will be made available for the agricultural and mining
                            development and the currency stabilization suggested.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these projects and despite the discouraging tone of the
                            memorandum in this particular respect, there continues to be some
                            discussion as to the possibility of obtaining sufficient funds to
                            complete the Vila Vila–Santa Cruz railway. For instance, there has been
                            presented to the Senate a draft of a law stating “from the loan which
                            the Government is trying to get from the United States, there shall be
                            set aside with preference the amount necessary for the Vila Vila–Santa
                            Cruz railway”. In fairness to the Government, however, it must be stated
                            that there has been no recent official statement of any kind with
                            reference to this railway.</p>
                        <p>Although it has been my understanding, unofficially, that the total
                            amount of the loan contemplated would probably not amount to more than
                            $20,000,000 as a maximum I can understand how the Bolivians, in their
                            usual optimistic manner, have seized upon a suggestion for a technical
                            study to mean that the entire study project would be carried into actual
                            production. The Government itself has made no pronouncement on the
                            subject except to release for newspaper publication the text of the
                            general memorandum. The newspapers however, on the basis of this and
                            also conversations with various Cabinet members, have expanded the
                            entire matter until only the most moderate estimates have been as low as
                            $30,000,000 and the most optimistic have been as high as $200,000,000.
                            The most recent newspaper reports have been as follows: <hi
                                rend="italic">Ultima Hora</hi>, $120,000,000; <hi rend="italic">El
                                Diario</hi>, between $70,000,000 and $80,000,000; <hi rend="italic"
                                >La Razón</hi>, $200,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Another encouragement to the generally hopeful attitude in the country
                            has been the return of Carlos Salamanca from the United States with very
                            glowing reports concerning the amount of help which Bolivia may expect
                            to receive. His newspaper interviews and report to Congress are being
                            covered in another despatch.</p>
                        <p>Although at this moment it seems unfortunate that the Bolivian public is
                            being misled, and that the good effect of the loan may be somewhat
                            lessened by too optimistic expectations, it is probable that previous
                            estimates of the amount involved will have been forgotten by the time
                            actual projects are named, and that local disappointment will not be
                            nearly so great as the present situation might indicate. In any event, I
                            do not think it can be said that the Government is intentionally
                            encouraging a misunderstanding of the matter. Rather, I believe that the
                            reaction here is more or less what might have been expected, assuming
                            the natural optimism of Bolivian statesmen and the nature of the survey
                            suggestions given them.</p>

                            Department’s telegram No. 127 of August 8 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>],
                            1941, 3 p.m., with reference to the proposed plan for economic
                            cooperation between the American and Bolivian Governments, and to report
                            that Mr. Santiago Schulze, Manager of the Banco Minero, recently
                            informed Mr. Hiern, Senior Economic Analyst and attached to this
                            Legation, that Mr. Schulze has had considerable correspondence with Mr.
                            Luis Fernando Guachalla in Washington on the subject of the appointment
                            of a commission of technicians to study mining conditions in Bolivia in
                            connection with a contemplated loan by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schulze seems to think that too much emphasis has been placed by
                            Bolivians on the financial aspect of the matter and too little on the
                            technical nature of the loan. Mr. Schulze and Mr. C. L. Ball, Technical
                            Adviser of the Banco Minero, think, as is evidently contemplated by our
                            Government, that any question of a loan should be preceded by a
                            scientific investigation of conditions more or less along the following

                                    operation which will place Bolivia in a better position to cope
                                    with post-war adjustments in prices. (For instance, some mines
                                    are shipping mixed concentrates of WO<hi rend="sub">3</hi> and
                                    Sn for the WO<hi rend="sub">3</hi> value only, being penalized
                                    for the Sn content. After the war, with proper separating
                                    equipment, these mines could ship the tin as their major product
                                    and the wolf ram as a by-product.)</item>

                        <p>While the foregoing is an outline of the opinion of Messrs. Schulze and
                            Ball, I understand that an extensive correspondence on the subject has
                            been carried on directly between Mr. Guachalla and Mr. Schulze. The
                            latter seems to think that an attempt may be made to secure a loan in
                            advance of the commission’s report and that such an attempt would only
                            serve to delay matters.</p>
                        <p>In a letter dated the latter part of last August, Mr. Guachalla informed
                            Mr. Schulze that it was the desire of the State Department that any loan
                            to Bolivia for mining purposes should be handled through the Banco
                            Minero.</p>
                        <p>The Economic Analyst of this Legation advises that he has seen the
                            facilities which would be available here for the use of the technical
                            commission. These consist of a fairly well equipped assay laboratory and
                            a small experimental laboratory with limited equipment.</p>

                            economic collaboration in development of national resources of Bolivia,
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs has again asked very earnestly that the
                            United States Government make some public statement regarding progress
                            of arrangements to send down technical commission and this commission
                            come with as little delay as possible. The Minister says that criticism
                            of delay is growing in and out of Bolivian Congress and he is most
                            anxious to announce here as early as possible when technical experts may
                            be expected to arrive. I hope that the Department will be able to
                            telegraph me some message to give to Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez.</p>

                                <p>“Your Excellency’s personal message of September 18 was awaiting
                                    me on my recent return to Washington. I heartily concur in your

                                    conversations which I have had the privilege of holding with the
                                    Bolivian Minister in Washington, Dr. Luis Fernando Guachalla,
                                    should be expedited. I wish to assure you that my Government is
                                    proceeding with all possible speed in the selection of the
                                    experts who will conduct the different surveys contemplated by
                                    our two Governments. A mining expert has already been selected
                                    and should reach Bolivia within the next few days. I hope
                                    shortly to be in a position to send you specific information

                            endeavor to dissuade the Bolivian Government from sending a mission to
                            the United States at this time to discuss the program of economic
                            cooperation. The Department agrees with you that it is highly desirable
                            to have the contemplated surveys completed and studies thereof made
                            before definitive arrangements are discussed with representatives of the
                            Bolivian Government.</p>
                        <p>Merwin L. Bohan, now Commercial Attaché at Bogotá, has been designated
                            head of the economic mission and is being ordered to the Department for
                            consultation preparatory to departing for La Paz at the earliest
                            practicable date. It is planned that the mission ultimately will
                            comprise a total of 7 experts, including 2 mining engineers, 2 highway
                            engineers and 2 agronomists.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 204 of October 25, 1941, 5 p.m., directing me
                            to endeavor again to dissuade the Bolivian Government from sending a
                            mission to the United States to discuss the program of economic
                            cooperation before the completion of the contemplated surveys by the
                            United States economic mission to be headed by Mr. Merwin L. Bohan and
                            studies thereof.</p>
                        <p>In the course of conversations this morning with Dr. Eduardo Anze
                            Matienzo, Bolivian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Joaquin Espada,
                            Minister of Finance, while I was presenting Mr. Philip W. Bonsai, Acting
                            Chief of the Division of American Republics of the <pb n="445"
                                xml:id="pg_445" facs="0455"/>Department, I took the opportunity to
                            comply with the Department’s instructions by pointing out that the
                            economic mission would shortly be in Bolivia and that its careful and
                            detailed studies would be necessary as a basis for adequate discussion
                            of any program of economic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to previous conversations some time ago with both men, I
                            found them both completely receptive to the idea. Two factors were
                            probably responsible for this change in attitude: (1) the fact that I
                            have recently been able to give them concrete information as to the
                            proximate arrival of the members of the mission, and (2) reports from
                            Mr. Luis Fernando Guachalla, the Bolivian Minister in Washington,
                            advising them that the way to handle the question of economic
                            cooperation was not to make a request for a lump sum loan at the present
                            time but to await the report of the economic mission. (Dr. Anze read us
                            part of a letter from Mr. Guachalla which served to give this
                            impression; Minister Guachalla’s brother, Mr. Carlos Guachalla, has told
                            me that he had received information from his brother that he was
                            bringing pressure to bear on his Government in this sense.)</p>
                        <p>…The Minister of Finance went into an exposition of the Standard Oil
                            case, giving in résumé some of the usual Bolivian criticisms of the
                            Standard Oil Company for its “obstructionist” attitude during the Chaco
                            War but stated that he had always held that, regardless of the failings
                            of the company, a contract was a contract and that the question should
                            be settled.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question of the foreign debt, he explained in a
                            reasonable manner why Bolivia had been forced to default on that debt:
                            (1) because of the world-wide economic depression of 1930 and subsequent
                            years, and (2) because of the continued financial difficulties of
                            Bolivia as a result of having to fight a long and disastrous war with
                            Paraguay. He made the interesting admission for a Bolivian official (I
                            have never heard it from the lips of any Bolivian, although it coincides
                            with the Legation’s opinion) that Bolivia is in a relatively better
                            economic condition than any other South American country as a result of
                            its increased sales of its principal exports, minerals, at high prices.
                            Mr. Espada stated that his primary object since being Minister of
                            Finance was to improve Bolivia’s financial position and increase its
                            reserves of foreign exchange, having succeeded in bringing these up from
                            $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 to $14,000,000. He said that his objective was
                            to make Bolivia’s finances and currency situation thoroughly sound so
                            that it could be in a position to meet its foreign obligations honestly
                            on a necessarily modified basis in keeping with its capacity to pay.</p>
                        <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>Going on from this discussion, Mr. Espada said that he hoped to
                            reorganize the Banco Central, the central government bank of issue, and
                            to stabilize Bolivian currency. In this connection, he remarked that he
                            hoped to get adequate advice on these subjects from Mr. Bohan; that he
                            had thought of requesting assistance from Dr. Edwin W. Kemmerer<note
                                n="74" xml:id="d460fn1">Professor at Princeton University and
                                president of Economists’ National Committee on Monetary
                                Policy.</note> but that it seemed better to use the economic mission
                            since it would make a thorough survey of all possible phases of economic
                            cooperation. I ventured to comment that, while I was sure that Mr. Bohan
                            would be glad to be of any possible assistance, his principal task would
                            be to coordinate and direct the activities of the mission and he was
                            furthermore a general economist rather than a banking and currency
                            specialist. Mr. Espada said that he hoped that such a specialist might
                            be a member of the mission.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to me that if the Department wishes to have the questions of
                            central bank reorganization and currency stabilization considered in
                            connection with the mission, it might be well to detail a specialist in
                            these matters to serve with the mission. It is my understanding that the
                            general question of Bolivian currency stabilization has already been
                            taken up with the Department by the Bolivian Minister in Washington.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to summarize below the
                            Legation’s general impressions concerning the program for economic
                            cooperation between the United States and Bolivia, and the Bolivian
                            attitude thereto. Some of these facts and considerations have been
                            reported to the Department in a wide number of despatches under
                            different headings while others are presented for the first time. It
                            seems well, with the advent close at hand of the full personnel of the
                            economic mission which is to study the possibilities of economic
                            cooperation, to bring together in one despatch all pertinent information
                            which has a direct bearing on the situation.</p>
                        <p>The basis for the proposed economic cooperation between the two countries
                            is, of course, contained in the memorandum handed by the Department to
                            the Bolivian Minister in Washington on August 1, <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0457"/>1941, and quoted in the Department’s
                            telegram No. 127 of August 1, 3 p.m., to the Legation. This memorandum
                            was carefully worded to make it clear that the Government of the United
                            States was prepared to have surveys made by competent experts and
                            engineers of the needs of Bolivia for economic assistance as regards
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) improvement of communications, (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) expansion and diversification of agricultural
                            production, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) stimulation of mineral production
                            by small miners and (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) stabilization of the
                            Bolivian currency. It was clear from the memorandum to anyone who could
                            read plain language (1) that no advance commitment was made to any
                            specific project or for the loaning of any specific amount, (2) that the
                            surveys would be the basis of recommendations as to individual projects
                            by the mission proposed in the memorandum, and (3) that the United
                            States would be prepared to extend financial and technical assistance
                            only “for the execution of individual projects which are considered
                            desirable, useful and practicable by both the Bolivian and United States
                            Governments”.</p>

                                Cooperation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, nobody in Bolivia, even among the Cabinet officers, seems
                            to have taken the trouble at the time to study the careful wording of
                            the memorandum. All that was in the mind of anybody then was that the
                            United States was ready to lend money to Bolivia and that bonanza was at
                            hand. A Cabinet committee composed of the Ministers of Finance, National
                            Economy, National Defense, Public Works and Labor was immediately formed
                            to make plans for asking for a definite loan in short order instead of
                            awaiting the surveys of the United States Economic Mission being sent to
                            Bolivia in keeping with the Bolivian Government’s acceptance of the
                            program outlined in the memorandum. This committee got to work with a
                            promptness almost unprecedented in Bolivian public affairs and presented
                            a report to the full Cabinet on August 20, 1941.</p>
                        <p>The report suggested that a loan of $80,000,000 be requested from the
                            United States, $30,000,000 of this amount to be made available in 1941
                            and $25,000,000 each in 1942 and 1943. The Cabinet committee earmarked
                            the proposed loan as follows: <list>
                                <item>$50,000,000 for the construction of railroads and highways
                                    throughout Bolivia.</item>
                                <item>$6,000,000 for assistance to agriculture and
                                    irrigation.</item>
                                <item>$2,000,000 for assistance in colonization.</item>
                                <item>$6,000,000 for industrial development.</item>
                                <item>$3,000,000 for assistance to small miners.</item>
                                <item>$1,000,000 for the establishment of an Agricultural
                                    Bank.</item>
                                <item>$5,000,000 for the establishment or extension of water systems
                                    and electric light plants in various cities.</item>
                                <item>$2,000,000 for a campaign against malaria and
                                    tuberculosis.</item>
                                <item>$5,000,000 for monetary stabilization.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0458"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">The question of service of the proposed loan was
                            disposed of neatly by the recommendation that the so-called additional
                            tax on the exportation of minerals be hypothecated for this purpose.
                            That this tax is almost half of Bolivia’s total revenues and that its
                            normal budget would thus be thrown out of kilter was brushed aside in
                            the enthusiasm of the moment. While the recommendations of the Cabinet
                            committee were supposedly confidential, the authors and their Cabinet
                            colleagues were so excited at the auto-imagined prospects of real money
                            to spend instead of Bolivia’s annual budget of $12,000,000 to
                            $15,000,000 that the whole plan was spread out in detail in the press on
                            the following day.</p>
                        <p>It was apparently the intention to present this ready-made plan to the
                            Economic Mission on its arrival which was then confidently expected at
                            any moment. That the Mission is to be a technical one and not one
                            empowered to decide upon the amount of possible loans was conveniently
                            disregarded. The program was outlined in general terms to the Chamber of
                            Deputies and Senate in secret sessions. When the Economic Mission did
                            not immediately arrive, opposition members threw cold water upon the
                            whole idea that the United States would lend Bolivia any such sum as was
                            suggested by the Cabinet committee (Mr. Carlos Salamanca, member of the
                            Chamber of Deputies had in the meantime written his opposition
                            colleagues from the United States giving a more realistic picture of the
                            possibilities of economic cooperation based on his conversations with
                            Messrs. Sumner Welles, Laurence Duggan and other officials of the
                            Department). It was this situation which appears to have largely caused
                            the anxiety of the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Alberto Ostria
                            Gutiérrez, and his insistence that the Economic Mission be despatched
                            post-haste (the Legation’s telegram No. 225 of August 28, 11 a.m. [<hi

                        <p>A further example of the … tendency to jump at the slightest of
                            possibilities and consider them as certainties occurred in connection
                            with the memorandum concerning a possible survey of potential highways
                            in Bolivia<note n="75" xml:id="d461fn1">Not printed.</note> which was
                            handed to the Bolivian Minister in Washington at the same time as the
                            covering memorandum of August 1, 1941, concerning economic and financial
                            cooperative measures in general. It will be recalled that the highway
                            memorandum was based on suggestions of the Bolivian Government for the
                            survey and construction or reconstruction of something over 11,400
                            kilometers of road network in Bolivia. The memorandum, prepared by
                            experts of the Public Roads Administration, detailed the 11,400
                            kilometers of roads for which a survey was requested but commented upon
                            the excessive cost thereof and recommended that the plan be
                            substantially reduced to be “more in line with the possibilities for
                            financing over a reasonable <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0459"
                            />period of years in the near future.” As might have been expected, the
                            Bolivian authorities overlooked these recommendations, concentrated on
                            the fact that the memorandum discussed the whole 11,400 kilometers, and
                            spread the word that the United States was agreeing to finance the whole
                            roads program. It was partly from this source that the idea of a
                            $200,000,000 loan in lieu of an $80,000,000 one, discussed below, got
                            its start.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The original talk of an $80,000,000 loan on the part of Cabinet officers
                            has already had serious political repercussions and will probably have
                            more when the financial cooperation program is finally worked out and it
                            is found, as will undoubtedly be the case, that credits to be advanced
                            are much smaller than the Administration led the country to believe
                            would be the case. There is no question in my mind but that the thought
                            that a big loan was to be forthcoming from the United States has
                            encouraged the political unrest which has been apparent in Bolivia for
                            the past two months and, specifically, was one of the indirect causes of
                            the recent wide-spread strike which, as explained in the despatches
                            reporting on it, was fomented by interests anxious to cause disturbances
                            in the country for political reasons. As one of the Independent
                            Socialist deputies has told me frankly, “If a large loan is to be spent
                            in Bolivia, we want to control the Government when it is disbursed.”
                            Similar thoughts have undoubtedly prevailed among other political groups
                            and among the Army elements which are always a danger to orderly
                            government in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>So far as the future is concerned, it can be imagined with what pleasure
                            the opposition will attack the Government when it fails to produce the
                            $80,000,000 total and the Cochabamba–Santa Cruz Railroad which it
                            promised. The lines to be taken will doubtless include allegations that
                            the Government has not made the most of the “offers” by the United
                            States of credits, that the opposition would have been much more
                            successful, etc., etc. The dilemma into which the Bolivian Government
                            has fallen and which will probably become worse because of the ineptness
                            with which it has managed presentation of the whole question of economic
                            cooperation is no direct concern of the United States. However,
                            stability of Government is a desideratum in Bolivia both for our own
                            interests and for the welfare of the country itself. The sad political
                            mistakes which have been made may increase the chronic unsettlement of
                            Bolivia. On the other hand, any kind of financial help will be a fillip
                            to Bolivian economy and may serve to counteract the political attacks on
                            the Government which can be expected.</p>

                        <p>Before drawing this already lengthy despatch to a close, it seems well to
                            make some comments on the actual administration of the program of
                            economic cooperation when it finally gets into its stride. In the first
                            place, the real need of Bolivia for financial assistance appears less
                            than that of almost any other country in Latin America given the
                            relative prosperity of the Government (the populace is, of course,
                            poverty-stricken as it always has been) resulting from increased sales
                            abroad at high prices of the minerals on which it depends for its
                            revenues through taxation. However, it cannot be left out of the general
                            program of continental economic cooperation for obvious international
                            political reasons. Furthermore, a serious crisis will come to this
                            improvident country after the War. The crisis will be of greater
                            proportions than the present relative boom unless some steps are taken
                            to cushion the lopsided economy of Bolivia by helping it to become more
                            or less agriculturally self-sufficient instead of “eating its tin”.
                            While Bolivia has the funds to make at least a start in this direction
                            on its own, there is not adequate vision or initiative in the country to
                            accomplish the task and help is necessary if the objective is to be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>It is generally recognized by everyone who has made a study of Bolivia
                            that the country’s hope of escaping from its dependence on imports of
                            food and other agricultural products, which would be endangered if its
                            exports of minerals were to bring in substantially less cash than now,
                            lies in the development of the subtropical eastern region of the country
                            and specifically of the section around Santa Cruz. While there are other
                            problems of grave importance involved in the opening up of eastern
                            Bolivia, such as the obtaining of sufficient manpower for agricultural
                            expansion, the main problem is that of communications with the region.
                            Discarding the possibility of completing the Cochabamba–Santa Cruz
                            Railroad at a cost of about $35,000,000 as uneconomic, there remains the
                            desirable objective of building a satisfactory all-weather highway, at a
                            cost of probably between $5,000,000 and $8,000,000, to replace the
                            present dry season trail.</p>
                        <p>It is the Legation’s feeling that, if at all feasible, the Economic
                            Mission should shortly after its constitution recommend the construction
                            of this highway. Studies on which such a recommendation could be based
                            exist in the reports of the United States Army engineers who were in
                            Bolivia last year to study communications between Cochabamba and Santa
                            Cruz and in surveys on which they in part based their work. The
                            recommendation, a request by the Bolivian Government for the necessary
                            credit and the granting of it by the Export-Import Bank would serve a
                            number of purposes. The Bolivians are expecting some sort of financial
                            aid from the United States in short <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451"
                                facs="0461"/>order. The Cochabamba–Santa Cruz or an alternative
                            highway is almost certainly one project which we will eventually approve
                            even if we take similar action on no other proposal. It is the
                            construction most needed in Bolivia. To push it through quickly would
                            convince the Bolivians that the Economic Mission signifies economic
                            cooperation instead of being merely a fact-finding expert appraisal with
                            no results, as they consider was the case with the studies of the
                            railroad engineers, the geological survey earlier this year, etc., all
                            of which have made them sceptical of economic aid. I discussed this
                            matter with Mr. Philip W. Bonsal, Acting Chief of the Division of the
                            American Republics, during his recent visit to La Paz and he shared my
                            feeling that approval of the Cochabamba–Santa Cruz highway should be the
                            first step in effective economic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Once a definite decision is made in this regard, it would probably be
                            best for the Economic Mission to take all necessary time in making
                            recommendations on other projects. The Bolivian Government and people
                            have more than a tendency, as has been indicated in the first part of
                            this despatch, to consider the program of economic cooperation as a
                            unilateral one of assistance from the United States to Bolivia,
                            forgetting that Bolivia has outstanding economic problems with the
                            United States which it should do something to settle, … It might be well
                            to make haste slowly and to utilize the interim to remind the Bolivian
                            Government tactfully that we have taken one step and that it is only
                            fair to expect them to take one in return before we give any more
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>There is one further point in connection with financial assistance for
                            Bolivia which the Department and the Export-Import Bank probably have
                            thoroughly in mind but which it may be worthwhile to mention
                            nevertheless. It is to be sincerely hoped that any credits to be granted
                            to the Bolivian Government or its entities will be doled out in small
                            amounts month by month as work progresses and that, in the case of such
                            projects as roads, arrangements will be included to have an American
                            technical man in charge so as to make certain that the project is
                            properly managed with a check on the handling of disbursements. Entirely
                            aside from the fact that this system will ensure greater efficiency (it
                            can be said without fear of contradiction that there are no Bolivian
                            engineers competent to manage a large-scale project) and lessen the
                            chances of waste of funds, it will reduce the incentive to potential
                            trouble-makers to foster a revolution, which will always be present if
                            there are loan funds to be freely disposed of.</p>

                            Foreign Affairs as to whether this Government will now carry through
                            with the program of economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Minister that this Government is of the opinion that

                            the utmost despatch in order that his Government’s share in the program

                            Bolivian production of tungsten. The Bolivian Government would commit
                            itself to organize production for a minimum annual exportation of 2,500
                            fine tons.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister called at my request. I said that Mr. Clayton,
                            Deputy Loan Administrator, and Mr. Charles B. Henderson, head of the
                            Metals Reserve Company, had showed me the correspondence with him as
                            regards the negotiations that have been taking place for the purchase of
                            Bolivian tungsten. This correspondence seemed to bring the negotiations
                            to an end.</p>
                        <p>I said that I had requested him to call in order to express to him my
                            regret at the situation. This purchase arrangement was obviously of
                            mutual advantage, and it seemed to me distinctly to be regretted that
                            its consummation should be prevented by a small difference over price
                            (which I had learned to be the fact).</p>
                        <p>I said that as I understood it, the Metals Reserve Company was offering
                            to buy Bolivian tungsten production at $16.50 per unit, and was offering
                            a three-year contract to buy it at this price. This compared with an
                            approximate pre-war average of $9 a unit.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that his Government too regretted the situation. The
                            difficulty was that they were in no position to make the different
                            mining interests accept the terms and all of them (he enumerated

                                >Mauricio Hochschild, S.A.M.I.</note>) were holding out for a higher
                            price because they were currently getting $17 in the New York market and
                            for occasional small lots somewhat more; furthermore, they had a
                            prospective market in the Far East. I said that his Government realized,
                            and I should think it could bring it home to these mining interests,
                            that our tin purchase contract and our plans for a smelter construction
                            had been of distinct interest and advantage to them. For another matter,
                            it strengthened their position in now dealing with the British and Dutch
                            as regards the renewal of the International Tin Agreement—a matter on
                            which the Minister had requested the <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454"
                                facs="0464"/>assistance of this Government only a few days ago.<note

                            said furthermore that if and as we could successfully negotiate this
                            agreement on tungsten, this Government would be prepared to consider
                            agreements for other metals of Bolivian production, such as antimony.
                            Lastly, I said that the Bolivian mining interests would be coming to
                            this Government for licenses to export machinery needed in their
                            operations, and on this matter too they would expect to be favored.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to the Minister that he might cable the above observations to
                            his Government with a request to bring them home to the mining interests
                            and endeavor to win acceptance of the offer of the Metals Reserve
                            Company. I said that furthermore the mining interests should recognize
                            that a term contract over three years was of great advantage to them. He
                            observed that the mining interests were “gamblers”. I said that speaking
                            wholly and solely on my own authority, I thought there was a chance the
                            Metals Reserve might pay the $17 on a two-year contract, but the present
                            proposal seemed much more equitable and desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Minister again reiterated the difficulties in bringing the mining
                            interests around to foregoing a possible pecuniary gain. He promised
                            however to cable at once to his Government and endeavor to persuade his
                            Government to make another effort to try to secure acceptance of the
                            Metals Reserve offer, or an acceptable counter-proposal.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 11 of January 28, 6 p.m., in regard to the
                            negotiations for the conclusion of a tungsten contract between the
                            Metals Reserve Company and the Bolivian Government or one of its
                            agencies, and my despatch No. 614 of January 30, 1941,<note n="87"
                                xml:id="d465fn1">Not printed.</note> commenting thereon.</p>
                        <p>It would be of assistance to the Legation if the Department could advise
                            it of the present status of these negotiations. Various local mining
                            interests seem to be in possession of information in regard to the
                            matter, probably from the Bolivian officials concerned, and it would be
                            helpful if the Legation were in a position to judge as to the accuracy
                            of their statements.</p>
                        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>According to the local mining interests mentioned, some progress has been
                            made in Washington in regard to terms on the rough basis of a two or
                            three years’ contract for all Bolivian tungsten production and a price
                            of approximately $17 per unit. These sources also state that some at
                            least of the small miners who sell to the Banco Minero, which in turn
                            now sells to Japanese buyers, prefer to continue present arrangements
                            with Japan as they now receive higher prices than they would under the
                            proposed United States-Bolivian contract, disregarding the greater
                            security inherent in the latter. However, as indicated in the last full
                            sentence on page three of my despatch No. 614, the Bolivian Minister of
                            National Economy<note n="88" xml:id="d465fn2">Edmundo Vásquez.</note>
                            appears disposed to force small miners by means of a Decree to sell to
                            the Banco Minero at a price to be fixed by it and thus make their
                            production available under the proposed United States-Bolivian
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this general problem, it is understood that the Banco
                            Minero has contracts with Japanese interests which run through next June
                            so that the full amount of tungsten handled by it would apparently not
                            be available for sale to the United States until after that time. It is
                            also understood that the Banco Minero makes most of its Japanese sales
                            to a Japanese combine composed of Mitsubishi, the Taibo Commercial Co.,
                            Itoh &amp; Co., Sanwa &amp; Co., and the Matsura Trading Co. The two
                            German firms of Kyllmann, Bauer &amp; Co. and Juan Eisner &amp; Co.,
                            established in Bolivia, have been buying some tungsten ore from the
                            Banco Minero, placed in port, and shipping it to Japan consigned to
                            Sanyei Yoko. It is not clear whether the latter is the combine referred
                            to.</p>
                        <p>It has been further learned that Bolivian tungsten going to Japan has
                            recently been shipped in double bags, as reported in my despatch No. 696
                            of March 10, 1941,<note n="89" xml:id="d465fn3">Not printed.</note> to
                            be understood to be the case with some shipments to the United States.
                            This would seem an added indication, besides various others previously
                            reported, that such ores are not retained in Japan but go on to a
                            destination in Germany.</p>

                        <p>19. Your despatch no. 698, March 11. The discussions regarding tungsten
                            purchases between the Federal Loan Administrator<note n="90"
                                xml:id="d466fn1">Jesse H. Jones.</note> and the Bolivian Minister
                            came to a pause over the matter of price. The <pb n="456"
                                xml:id="pg_456" facs="0466"/>Federal Loan Administrator had offered
                            $16.50 per unit for all Bolivian production during the next 2 years and
                            for the third year had offered market price with a minimum of $14 and a
                            maximum of $16. The Minister stated that his Government found these
                            terms not sufficiently favorable. He stated that his Government was
                            apparently impressed with the opportunities for immediate sale in this
                            country and elsewhere at a higher price.</p>
                        <p>The Department was reluctant to see this break in negotiations and
                            therefore persuaded the Federal Loan Administrator to consider an
                            improvement. It is now informed that on the 18th of March Deputy Loan
                            Administrator Clayton told the Minister that if his Government would
                            make an offer to sell for $17 per unit during the first 2 years and on
                            the terms described above for the third year Clayton would do his best
                            to persuade the committee to accept. Nothing further has been heard from
                            the Minister.</p>
                        <p>This information is for your background knowledge in order that you may
                            clear up any mistaken or prejudicial reports. Within your discretion,
                            also please do anything possible to induce the Bolivian authorities to
                            make the suggested offer. According to the Minister, the difficulty lies
                            with the mining interests rather than with the governmental
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>These mining interests should be cognizant of the general benefits
                            accruing to them from the tin purchase contract and from the various
                            other aids which this Government has been extending to Bolivia.</p>

                        <p>34. Department’s 19, March 20, 7 p.m. Opposition to proposed terms of
                            tungsten contract comes not from large producers but from small tungsten
                            miners who produce about 30% of Bolivian tungsten and who sell through
                            Banco Minero and Hochschild to Japan for prices now as high as $24 per
                            unit. Argument advanced in last paragraph of Department’s telegram does
                            not appeal to them as most do not produce tin. They have little capital
                            invested and higher immediate profits interest them far more than
                            security over a period of years.</p>
                        <p>Unless opposition of tungsten miners can be overcome (it is not apparent
                            how this can be done) and their production covered by proposed contract,

                        <p>32. Your 34, March 22, 1941. On April 8, the Deputy Federal Loan
                            Administrator addressed the following letter to the Minister of Bolivia
                            in Washington: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I confirm telephone conversation in which I advised you that we
                                    accept the offer of your Government to sell to the Metals
                                    Reserve Company the entire Bolivian production of tungsten ore
                                    for 3 years (maximum 3,500 short tons in any one year) at the
                                    price of $17 per short ton unit f.o.b. docks New York.</p>
                                <p>It is further understood, if the annual production of Bolivian
                                    tungsten during the period in question should exceed 3,500 short
                                    tons, the Metals Reserve Company is to have an option to
                                    purchase such excess at $17 per short ton unit f.o.b. docks New
                                    York.</p>
                                <p>You have advised me that your Government has indicated its
                                    willingness to give the Metals Reserve Company an option for the
                                    purchase of Bolivian production of tungsten for a period beyond
                                    the 3 years herein contemplated.</p>
                                <p>We would like to have an option for the production of 2
                                    additional years at $17 per short ton unit f.o.b. docks New
                                    York, this option to be exercised not later than 2 years from
                                    the date of signing with your Government the contract herein
                                    contemplated.</p>
                                <p>I understand you are cabling to your Government our acceptance of
                                    its offer as above and that you will communicate to us your
                                    Government’s confirmation of the transaction as soon as
                                    received.</p>

                                    purpose of preparing a contract.”</p>

                            tungsten producers to accept a three year sales contract with the United
                            States at $17 per unit, and to report the following as an interesting
                            indication of the pressure which certain interests may attempt to bring
                            in order to discourage a final consummation of the contract.</p>
                        <p>From a source which is thoroughly reliable, but strictly confidential,
                            the Legation has learned that cables urging intervention in order to
                            prevent the signing of a contract which would provide for the sale of
                            Bolivia’s total production of tungsten to the United States were
                            received today from Japan by some seven individuals and organizations.
                            Four of the individuals receiving cables are in the Bolivian army, all
                            of them except possibly one, however, are comparatively unimportant at
                            the present time. The interesting feature in connection with these
                            officers included in the list of those receiving telegrams is that they
                            have all been in Japan at one time or another in an official
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Legation was of course a recipient of one of the cables, as
                            was the Banco Minero, the message to the latter including the additional
                            request that everything possible be done to reserve seventy tons of
                            tungsten monthly for Japan. The final telegram on the list was sent to
                            Mr. Vásquez, Minister of National Economy, indicating a lack of
                            information by the Japanese as to his position in the matter, since it
                            has been the Minister of Economy more than anyone else in Bolivia who
                            has pushed the negotiations with the United States to the position where
                            they now are, and who has brought the small miners into line.</p>
                        <p>Although it is not thought that these cables will have any effect at all
                            upon the course of the tungsten negotiations, it is believed that the
                            fact they were sent will be of interest to the Department as an
                            indication of the concern with which Japan is apparently viewing the
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>43. The Bolivian Minister was asked to call at the Department subsequent
                            to the telephone conversation between Clayton, Feis, and yourself.</p>
                        <p>The attempt was made to impress him, so that he might put the matter as
                            completely as possible before his Government, with the fact that the
                            Bolivian Government could fairly be asked to make a special <pb n="459"
                                xml:id="pg_459" facs="0469"/>effort to conclude the sale of tungsten
                            to us in the light of our many sided present effort to contribute to
                            Bolivian welfare, including recent discussions having to do with aid
                            under the lease-lend bill.<note n="92" xml:id="d470fn1">55 Stat.
                                81.</note> It was explained to him that the Federal Loan
                            Administrator had been of the opinion that an effective agreement had
                            actually been negotiated and had a natural sense of disappointment to
                            find that he was now being pressed to make further offers at the risk of
                            disturbing the whole market for tungsten.</p>
                        <p>The Minister was informed however that upon the urging of this Department
                            the Federal Loan Administrator is prepared to increase his purchase
                            price for tungsten. He was told that what the Federal Loan Administrator
                            wished to ascertain was the price at which now the Bolivian Government
                            would commit itself immediately and finally and that we wished to avoid
                            any possibility that after improving the price on which our previous
                            discussions had been based the matter might become the subject of still
                            further uncertainty and bargaining maneuver. It was hinted to the
                            Minister that the Metals Reserve Company would consider a price in the
                            neighborhood of $19 or $20; it was evident that the Minister thought
                            that his Government would be pleasantly surprised by this substantial
                            improvement in the present arrangement.</p>

                            Government fully approves this contract and guarantees the fulfillment
                            of its terms on the part of the various signers thereof. The said
                            guarantee with relation to the shipments will be exercised in accordance
                            with the usual administrative measures for keeping a <pb n="460"

                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>I have added my signature to that of the producers of Bolivian tungsten
                            in representation of the Banco Minero de Bolivia (the Bolivian Mining
                            Bank) and by special instructions received from that important
                            institution of my country which, in its turn, represents according to
                            law numerous smaller enterprises in their relations abroad.</p>
                        <p>In expressing to Your Excellency my thanks for the valued cooperation
                            which was constantly rendered me by the Department of State, I have the

                        <p>82. Negotiations for the acquisition of the zinc and lead production of
                            Bolivia will be begun in the near future with Mauricio Hochschild<note

                                that bore his name.</note> who is coming to this country, arriving
                            in Washington the end of June. The Metals Reserve Company desires to
                            acquire the entire Bolivian production of antimony. It understands that
                            the total production is about 11,000 metric tons of 65% concentrate,
                            that this production is largely in the hands of small miners, and that
                            exports to Japan are presently at the rate of about 5,000 metric tons
                            per annum, the rest being exported to the United States and Great
                            Britain. You are requested to telegraph whether these figures are
                            correct and whether you believe that an agreement similar to that of the
                            tungsten agreement is feasible. In this connection the Department
                            emphasizes that antimony is much less important than tin and tungsten.
                            Accordingly, if you anticipate that extremely high prices will be asked
                            by the small producers in reliance on the tungsten precedent, it is
                            better not to begin the negotiations as the Metals Reserve Company is
                            not prepared to pay over $90.00 per short ton of 65% concentrate at West
                            Coast ports which is the prevailing New York rate less freight, or to
                            enter into a contract for more than one year. It is requested that you
                            consult with Altshuler<note n="95" xml:id="d472fn2">H. I. Altshuler,

                            worthwhile to begin negotiations on these conditions.</p>

                        <p>169. Metals Reserve Company has been negotiating with Mauricio Hochschild
                            and with the Bolivian Minister as the representative of the Banco Minero
                            for the purchase of the entire production of Bolivian zinc, lead, and
                            antimony. Contracts for the purchase of the entire zinc and lead
                            production have now been agreed upon and both sides are ready to sign.
                            An integral part of the arrangement is that there be control of exports
                            of these products. Your despatch 999 [<hi rend="italic">994</hi>] of
                            August 12<note n="96" xml:id="d473fn1">Not printed</note> indicates that
                            the Supreme Decree described in paragraph 5 of the note from the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs is to be issued in the near future. It is
                            accordingly suggested that you consult the Bolivian authorities and
                            telegraph whether upon the signature of (1) the contract between Metals
                            Reserve and Hochschild for the purchase of the Huanchacha zinc and lead;

                            Minister as to the lead other than the Huanchacha lead, the Bolivian

                                <item>Exchange diplomatic notes with you whereby the Government of
                                    Bolivia will agree to prohibit the export of zinc and lead
                                    during the life of the contracts with Metals Reserve except to
                                    the United States, other American republics having systems of
                                    export control satisfactory to the Government of the United
                                    States, and the British Empire.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The negotiations for the purchase of the antimony are in deadlock because
                            of price. Since the antimony production in Bolivia is widely scattered,
                            it seems appropriate not to negotiate this contract with Hochschild. It
                            is accordingly suggested that you consult with Altshuler, Metals Reserve
                            representative in La Paz, and begin negotiations in collaboration with
                            him with the Bolivian authorities looking forward to an agreement
                            whereby the Metals Reserve Company will buy the entire antimony
                            production of Bolivia at the current rate until February 1, 1943, except
                            such part thereof as may be sold to Great Britain, provided that there
                            be established immediately an export control system similar to that to
                            be provided for lead and zinc prohibiting the export of antimony except
                            to the United States, other American republics having satisfactory
                            systems of export control, and the British Empire. In the negotiations
                            with Hochschild here <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0472"/>he
                            suggested a price of $2.05 per metric ton unit. Metals Reserve considers
                            the highest which should be paid is $1.95 per metric ton unit f.o.b.
                            Arica and believes it should be possible to obtain a price of $1.90.</p>
                        <p>The Department is informed that there have been various shipments of
                            Bolivian tin to the Axis including shipments in June and July from the
                            Banco Minero to itself at Kobe. In view of the purchase agreements with
                            the Metals Reserve and the British, please attempt to obtain the
                            inclusion within the export embargo referred to above of tin allowing it
                            to go only to the United States, other American republics having export
                            control systems satisfactory to the United States Government, and the
                            British Empire.</p>

                            for control of exports as described in my despatch No. 994<note n="97"
                                xml:id="d474fn1">Not printed.</note> was issued on July 31 and

                        <p>Anticipate no trouble with regard to exchange of notes regarding zinc and
                            lead except that Banco Minero wishes to be free to export lead to
                            Argentina. Presumably this will be covered by clause concerning American
                            Republics having systems of export control satisfactory to the
                            Government of the United States but I would appreciate confirmation.</p>
                        <p>Question of prohibition of the exportation of tin may be complicated by
                            fact that small exports which have recently been made to Japan are
                            understood to be of ores not acceptable to Metals Reserve Company under
                            contract. Does the Department wish me to try for a complete prohibition
                            or would it be satisfied with exception for such ores.</p>
                        <p>Request prompt reply to above points so that I may be in a position to
                            discuss exchange of notes with Foreign Minister.</p>

                        <p>175. Your 258 of September 20. Metals Reserve agrees that Banco Minero is
                            to be free to export lead concentrates to the Argentine up to 400 tons
                            monthly.</p>
                        <p>The Department is insistent that the exportation of tin be prohibited by
                            the Supreme Decree, except to the United States, United Kingdom, and the
                            other American republics having satisfactory systems of export control.
                            If this embargo can be obtained without any commitment on the part of
                            the Metals Reserve to buy the low-grade ores, it would be a most
                            desirable solution. If you are unable to obtain this result, the matter
                            will be taken up with the Metals Reserve with a recommendation from the
                            Department that the low-grade ores be purchased.</p>
                        <p>A draft of the proposed antimony contract is being sent to you by air
                                mail.<note n="98" xml:id="d475fn1">This contract was signed on March

                        <postscript>
                            <p>Late in the afternoon I had an opportunity of examining the file
                                containing the exchange between Secretary Hull and Señor Finot in
                                May 1937. In view of the fact that the Secretary’s message was
                                “personal and confidential” I telephoned the Bolivian Minister and
                                stated that in my opinion it would be better for there to be no
                                publication until the Secretary had been consulted. I stated that
                                this observation of mine was in no sense based upon the contents of
                                the Secretary’s message but rather upon its character. The Bolivian
                                Minister said that he would immediately telegraph La Paz along the
                                lines of my remarks but that it was his impression that it was now
                                too late to prevent or delay this publication.</p>

                            discussions in Bolivian Senate of Standard Oil matter and especially to
                            publication of Secretary Hull’s personal letter to Minister Finot and
                            other confidential documents.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0476"/>
                        <p>Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez said he consulted Minister Guachalla as to the
                            advisability of publishing this correspondence and that Guachalla had
                            first replied affirmatively but later telegraphed not to do so because
                            Department would not approve. Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez said unfortunately
                            publication has already taken place. He greatly regretted this and asked
                            me so to telegraph Department. He did not explain however why he failed
                            first to instruct Guachalla to ask the Department’s consent before
                            publication.</p>
                        <p>The Minister added that the Cabinet had decided to lay the entire
                            Standard Oil matter before the Senate and Bolivian public in the hope
                            that a settlement might thus be facilitated. He said he expected Senate
                            to request Government to begin negotiations with company.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister I would of course telegraph the substance of his
                            remarks and at the same time I expressed the hope that publication of
                            the confidential documents would not cause Secretary Hull undue
                            embarrassment.</p>

                        <p>39. Meetings are scheduled tonight of newspaper workers and several other
                            unions in sympathy with demonstrations which took place yesterday of
                            taxi drivers’ and mechanics’ union protesting against alleged
                            interference by Standard Oil Company in Bolivian affairs. About 350 taxi
                            drivers and mechanics paraded through streets to Plaza Murillo and
                            speeches were made in front of legislative building, but there was no
                            disorder. These demonstrations are obviously designed to deter the
                            Government from making any concessions in proposed settlement in the
                            Standard Oil case and are doubtless instigated by Radical-Socialist
                            elements, probably with German support.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my despatch 705 of March 13<note n="10" xml:id="d479fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> the Standard Oil case has been under discussion
                            in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and yesterday afternoon the
                            Senate adopted a resolution approving in a general way the Government’s
                            policy toward the Standard Oil case, although it is not clear just what
                            the policy is. Discussions are still continuing in the Chamber of
                            Deputies where there is much more opposition to the administration and
                            the outcome is uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Although Minister of Foreign Affairs and other Ministers have made
                            lengthy statements on the Government’s policy in relation to <pb n="467"
                                xml:id="pg_467" facs="0477"/>the Standard Oil case, they had said
                            little or nothing calculated to build up a friendly understanding for us
                            in the minds of the Bolivian people and I fear that little has been
                            accomplished in these debates. Despatch follows by air mail.<note n="11"

                            advantage of the opportunity to discuss these developments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 726 of March 27, 1941,<note n="12" xml:id="d480fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> and especially my telegram No. 39 of March 27, 3
                            p.m., concerning the opposition to the Government’s plan to settle the
                            Standard Oil case, and to report that another demonstration of labor
                            organizations is scheduled for Thursday, April 3. This will doubtless be
                            much larger than the first, but the Government does not expect any
                            disorders.</p>
                        <p>I had an opportunity to discuss the situation this afternoon with Dr.
                            Ostria Gutiérrez at the Foreign Office. The Minister had just come from
                            the Chamber of Deputies where he had been answering a series of
                            questions put by deputies opposed to the Government’s plan for
                            negotiating a settlement of the Standard Oil case. He was obviously very
                            tired and, I thought, rather discouraged.</p>
                        <p>He said the public demonstration of the day before of the chauffeurs’ and
                            mechanics’ union was doubtless instigated by socialists of whom there
                            were many who had supported the Busch regime. These people were now
                            followers of Major Belmonte (The Department will recall that Belmonte is
                            actually in exile although nominally serving as Bolivian Military
                            Attaché at Berlin) and are a dangerously radical lot, he said. During
                            the debate one of the deputies, the Minister said, talked of revolution
                            if the Government agreed to pay any indemnity to the Standard Oil
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>According to Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez, fifteen members of the Chamber have
                            already given notice of their intention to speak on the Standard Oil
                            case and the Minister did not know how long the discussion would
                            continue. He seemed to fear it would last another ten days or two weeks,
                            and declared more than once that it would be difficult to bring the
                            question to a vote, although he seemed to feel that if there were a vote
                            the Government would have a majority.</p>
                        <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0478"/>
                        <p>The Minister asked me to explain to the Department that he had found it
                            necessary to deal very frankly during the debate with both the Senate
                            and the Chamber and had referred to all phases of the Standard Oil
                            controversy, but that in doing so he had endeavored to present the
                            matter fairly, both from the point of view of Bolivia and of the United
                            States. He mentioned Secretary Hull’s confidential letter to Dr. Finot
                            and he said he had explained to the deputies that the Secretary had
                            adopted this plan of communicating with the then Bolivian Foreign
                            Minister because he did not want to allow the slightest impression that
                            our Government was threatening Bolivia or demanding compensation for the
                            Standard Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the attitude of the radical deputies, the Department may
                            be interested in a conversation Dr. Oreamuno (of the Inter-American
                            Development Commission now in Bolivia) tells me he had a day or two ago
                            with Dr. Baldivieso, formerly Vice President in the Busch Government.
                            According to Mr. Baldivieso, there was very serious opposition in the
                            Bolivian army to any cash settlement of the Standard Oil case and if the
                            Government continued in its plan to settle the matter in that way, there
                            was danger of revolution. Mr. Baldivieso said he was not in the same
                            political party as President Peñaranda, but he was personally very
                            friendly with him and had recently told the President the situation
                            would be serious if the Government continued its policy with regard to
                            the Standard Oil matter.</p>
                        <p>As the Department knows, Mr. Baldivieso was treated with scant respect by
                            the Quintanilla regime<note n="13" xml:id="d480fn2">Gen. Carlos
                                Quintanilla assumed executive power on August 23, 1939, following
                                the death of President Germán Busch; see <ref

                            which refused to permit him to succeed to the Presidency, as he had a
                            right to expect at the time of President Busch’s death. He is generally
                            regarded as a weak unimportant person but there may be some foundation
                            for what he has had to say regarding the attitude of certain groups in
                            the Army. On the whole the Ministers concerned in the Standard Oil
                            controversy seem to feel that the Government will finally win out,
                            although there may still be a good deal of talk in the Chamber and more
                            street demonstrations.</p>

                        <p>As was the case with the Senate debate, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
                            Finance and National Economy<note n="15" xml:id="d481fn2">Edmundo
                                Vásquez headed the latter two Ministries.</note> have had to be
                            present in the Chamber for hours daily with consequent prejudice to
                            their handling of regular administrative tasks. The same ground has been
                            gone over in much the same manner as during the Senate debate. There
                            have, however, been certain differences in stress.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, there has been so much attack on the Standard Oil
                            Company from non-Government sources in the course of the debates and in
                            the press, that the Cabinet officers have gone beyond their original
                            stand that nobody was trying to defend the Standard Oil Company and have
                            taken some of the ground out from under their opponents’ feet by
                            attacking the Company fairly bitterly themselves. In this connection, it
                            may be well to express my opinion that, whatever the rights and wrongs
                            of the case, practically everybody in Bolivia, including the most
                            conservative elements, is convinced of the alleged crimes of the
                            Standard Oil Company and that it would be a practically impossible task
                            to alter their beliefs in this respect.</p>
                        <p>As an example, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, certainly as honest a
                            supporter of collaboration with the United States as there is in
                            Bolivia, yesterday sent me a copy of a pamphlet entitled “Defraudation,
                            History of an Oil Enterprise in Bolivia”, as containing a fair statement
                            of the Standard Oil case, the viewpoints of which he shared. This
                            article first appeared in the September–October [1939] number of <hi
                                rend="italic">Bolivia</hi>, a magazine published under the auspices
                            of the Bolivian Consul General in New York, as a reply to a booklet
                            entitled “Confiscation” circulated by the Standard Oil Company of
                            Bolivia, and presents a pretty thorough indictment of the Company.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary to this increased antagonism to the Standard Oil Company
                            itself, there has been an increase in the stress laid on the economic
                            factor, i.e., the securing of loans from the United States, as the main
                            and almost sole reason for a settlement. In an interesting exposition to
                            the Chamber on April 1, 1941, for example, the Minister of Finance
                            stated clearly that if a settlement of the Standard <pb n="470"

                                    the Department of State as a result of our request for economic

                                    the necessary resources within our own economy. The public of

                                    would be impossible to finance the railroad joining it to
                                    Cochabamba. I inquire what other manner there may be for
                                    financing this railroad. Let us not delude ourselves. Neither
                                    can Tarija think of developing itself without a railroad by

                        <p>As has been reported before, the Government spokesmen have given the
                            impression in their explanations that a loan for the construction of the
                            Cochabamba–Santa Cruz Railroad is a foregone conclusion if the Standard
                            Oil case is settled. In keeping with this the Minister of Foreign

                        <p>Another alteration in emphasis in the Cabinet officers’ presentation of
                            their case before the Chamber as compared with their statements to the
                            Senate has been their assurance that no definite settlement has yet been
                            considered and that if and when any is decided upon it will be submitted
                            to Congress for its approval. This is an apparent change in attitude as
                            the original idea of the Bolivian Government seems to have been to get
                            what would in effect be advance approval and then work out the details

                        <p>Aside from his part in trying to make it appear that loans from the
                            United States will be forthcoming if the Standard Oil case is settled,
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in his statements to the Chamber, has
                            shown a somewhat more satisfactory approach to the problem than in the
                            Senate. He went out of his way to defend the position of the Department,
                            stating that the allegation in the <hi rend="italic">petición de informe
                                to</hi> which the Ministers are replying that the Department <pb
                                n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0481"/>is imperialistic is unfounded.
                            However, he went too far in this defense, having asserted that: <quote

                                <p>“The Department of State not only has not adopted the Standard’s
                                    arguments but has not even disputed the Supreme Court decision

                        <p rend="flushleft">I know of no proper basis for this statement and
                            certainly did not give the confirmation which the Minister alleges I
                            did.</p>
                        <p>One point should perhaps be made in regard to the Foreign Minister’s
                            releasing of confidential documents and references to confidential
                            conversations and negotiations which have been mentioned in previous
                            despatches. I believe that his broad intentions in this respect have
                            been good whatever the apparent disregard of normal diplomatic courtesy.
                            He is in a position where his opponents are going to use every bit of
                            ammunition they can to attack the Government and the idea of a
                            settlement. With the leaks which inevitably take place in Bolivian
                            Government offices, it is probably better for him to release the actual
                            wording of communications and give his own account of negotiations and
                            conversations than to have these brought up in a distorted manner by
                            opposition Congressmen with the necessity for rectification later. As in
                            the case of publicity in other countries, an original statement,
                            accurate or erroneous, has more effect in Bolivia than a later
                            correction. The Foreign Minister has thus seemingly felt that full
                            publicity was the best strategy.</p>
                        <p>For example, he recently brought up the question of the representations
                            by Ambassador Armour in Buenos Aires last year, under instructions from
                            the Department, in regard to the Argentine-Bolivian negotiations for the
                            utilization by Argentina of Bolivian oil. His statements on this point
                            were not covered in the official Chamber summary of his remarks but
                            persons who were present during this stage of the debate state that he
                            gave the impression that the Department had disavowed any intention of
                            interfering in a bilateral matter between Argentina and Bolivia, which
                            is hardly accurate. However, as stated above, I believe that in this
                            particular phase he is doing his best in a most difficult problem. He is
                            in the position of trying to defend an unpopular policy and to show that
                            the United States Government is not the devil his opponents would like
                            to pretend. What would appeal to the American man in the street and to
                            his Bolivian counterpart toward this end are as far apart as the two
                            poles. Since he is dealing with a Bolivian, not an American, audience,
                            he naturally colors his arguments to appeal to it.</p>
                        <p>As has been stated in earlier despatches, the bitter opposition to a
                            settlement of the Standard Oil question has come from the left-wing <pb
                                n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0482"/>groups, the Unified Socialists
                            who are allied with ex-President Toro as well as the Independent
                            Socialists with their national socialist trend of thought. These groups
                            and the newspapers supporting them, which are doubtless partly financed
                            by German sources, have concentrated on the totally false thesis that
                            settlement of the Standard Oil case means return of the seized
                            properties to that Company, which has not been advanced by the Bolivian
                            Government forces in any way as a desideratum and which, so far as is
                            known, is not even desired by the Company.</p>
                        <p>The opposition forces incited the mass meeting of labor unions in
                            opposition to the Government’s Standard Oil policy scheduled for last
                            night and mentioned in my despatch No. 731. This was, however, banned by
                            the Government yesterday and was not held. The leftist deputies
                            introduced a <hi rend="italic">petición de informe</hi> calling on the
                            Minister of Government to explain at a special session of the Chamber
                            last night why the ban had been placed on the meeting. The session was
                            not, however, held because of the lack of a quorum.</p>
                        <p>The announced meeting caused considerable concern in quarters supporting
                            the Administration. In this connection, the Executive Committee of the

                            parties, the National Democratic Alliance, formation of which was
                            reported in my despatch No. 718 of March 20, 1941,<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d481fn5">Not printed.</note> on April 2, 1941, issued a
                            manifesto to the public, published in yesterday morning’s press, which
                            reads as follows in translation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Parties which form the National Democratic Alliance consider
                                    it their duty to address themselves to the People to warn them
                                    against a covert agitation on the part of audacious groups which
                                    wish to sow chaos in the Republic and again get control over its
                                    destinies.</p>
                                <p>“In recent days, these agitators have taken as their banner the
                                    question of the Standard Oil, spreading rumors in the street, in
                                    the daily press and in Parliament that what is being considered
                                    is the return of the petroleum wealth of the Sovereign Bolivian
                                    State to the Standard Oil. This calumnious version has already
                                    been denied repeatedly by the Ministers of State, by the
                                    President of the Nation himself and by representatives of the
                                    different parties in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.
                                    Nevertheless, it continues to serve as an instrument to arouse
                                    street passions. There are in circulation at this very moment
                                    criminal incitations, couched in sensational verbiage, calling
                                    on the People for a public demonstration ‘against delivery of
                                    our petroleum and treason to the Fatherland’.</p>
                                <p>“It is the duty of every citizen to defy these instigations,
                                    behind which lurk ambition and anarchy. Nobody is thinking of
                                    despoiling Bolivia of its petroleum wealth. The agitation
                                    provoked by these unbridled groups may launch Bolivia into chaos
                                    and affect its future.”</p>

                        <p>As can be seen from the above, the Standard Oil question has become a
                            political football which is being used for purely partisan purposes in a
                            completely unfair manner. The allegations in the manifesto that the
                            left-wing opposition is utilizing the Standard Oil case in order to
                            attempt to create a false impression in the public and to take advantage
                            of this for its own selfish ends seem to be fully substantiated. It has
                            been brought out by the Cabinet officers, in their testimony, that the
                            present Bolivian Administration has followed the directives on the
                            Standard Oil question laid down by the very deceased President, Germán
                            Busch, who is pointed to by large sectors of the leftist opposition as
                            their idol. This fact is, however, conveniently brushed aside or ignored
                            by the opposition.</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate that the bringing up of the Standard Oil case at this
                            time, by unilateral action of the Bolivian Government, without any
                            suggestion or pressure on our part, should have the effect it has had
                            but this is perhaps inevitable in Bolivia where petty political designs
                            play a far more important role in the thoughts and actions of most
                            politicians than do questions of national need or benefit. The situation
                            has, however, been made worse by the bad generalship and lack of courage
                            of the Government forces on the whole in presenting their arguments.
                            Fortunately, they have recently been more vigorous in their approach.
                            While the present agitation has its elements of danger, it seems
                            probable that it will blow over as similar affairs have in the past. The
                            success of the Government in banning the meeting scheduled for yesterday
                            without any material trouble arising is an indication that it may be
                            getting the situation into hand.</p>
                        <p>This political situation is, of course, an internal Bolivian matter. It
                            is, nevertheless, unfortunate that the agitation should revolve around a
                            question in which the United States is involved. Furthermore, it has an
                            inevitable effect of weakening a Government, which, for all its
                            vacillation, is more friendly to the United States by far than the
                            nationalistic and radical opposition, part of which is under German
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>As has been remarked before, the most unfortunate aspect may come if and
                            when Congressional approval for a policy of settlement of the Standard
                            Oil case is obtained. Should a settlement be reached, the very Cabinet
                            officers who have been presenting the Government’s case have so weighted
                            their arguments as to convince the Bolivian public that, in return for a
                            small cash payment to the Standard Oil Company, Bolivia will get very
                            substantial loans from the United States.</p>
                        <p>Such loans can hardly be justified either on the grounds of Bolivia’s
                            capacity to pay, since it is now in default on American loans to the
                            total of $100,000,000 in principal and arrears of interest with no
                            concrete <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0484"/>steps whatever yet
                            taken for adjustment, or on those of real need, since Bolivia is the one
                            Latin American country which is today in a better economic position than
                            at the outbreak of the European War. Its exports have increased and it
                            is getting a better price for tin and other products.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, these considerations are not apparent to the average
                            Bolivian who knows only that the United States through the Export-Import
                            Bank has extended loans to other Latin American countries, but not to
                            Bolivia. No thought is ever given whether loans are really needed or how
                            they are to be repaid. The general attitude may be summarized in the
                            statement of one of the most enlightened of the Cabinet officers to Mr.
                            Warren Lee Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank during his
                            recent visit to Bolivia, “What is our share (<hi rend="italic">Guánto
                                nos toca a nosotros</hi>)?” The general feeling is distinctly that
                            economic cooperation would mean cash in hand for Bolivia from the United
                            States. Should loans not be forthcoming for Bolivia after a Standard Oil
                            settlement, anti-American agitators will have excellent ammunition,
                            given the peculiar Bolivian mentality. Our friends in the Bolivian
                            Cabinet are placing us in a most difficult position, I fear, and I don’t
                            see just how we are going to be able to counteract it.</p>
                        <p>As I have tried to make clear in previous despatches, I am not averse to
                            a sensible loan to Bolivia for real needs, such as improvement in
                            communications which could form part of or connect with the Pan American
                            Highway, as a measure of intercontinental solidarity, but I do feel that
                            every effort should first be made to bring a proper understanding into
                            the presentation of the problem locally. A $25,000,000 loan, as
                            suggested by the Minister of Finance, seems beyond the bounds of common
                            sense under existing conditions in this country. It is regrettable to
                            have to admit that the debate in the Congress seems to have done more
                            harm than good to our relations with Bolivia, and even if the Government
                            gets a favorable vote in the Chamber, it is evident the radicals will
                            continue their opposition to any settlement involving a cash payment to
                            the Standard Oil Company.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 739 of April 4, 1941, concerning the debate in the Bolivian Chamber
                            of Deputies on <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0485"/>the Standard Oil
                            question, and to report that in the course of a conversation on various
                            matters I had with Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez at the Foreign Office on April
                            26, he mentioned this case especially, and said he was afraid the
                            Department did not realize what a serious matter it was in Bolivia and
                            how bitterly the people generally and Army officers especially hated the
                            company. He had done his best, he declared, to bring about a settlement,
                            but one could see how difficult it was to do so. He felt the Department
                            was too severe in the attitude it had adopted regarding loans, and said
                            he was going to write a letter to Minister Guachalla in his own
                            handwriting explaining the situation, and asking him to beg the
                            Department if possible to put the Standard Oil case aside for the
                            present so that the Government here would be in a better position to
                            strengthen its relations with the United States. While Dr. Ostria
                            Gutiérrez and the other Ministers undoubtedly have managed the Standard
                            Oil proceedings in Parliament very badly, I really believe they did the
                            best that they could, or at least the best to be expected of them, and I
                            confess I agree with Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez that feeling against the
                            company is very bitter indeed, and will probably continue to be so for a
                            long time to come unless something can be done to clear up the fog now
                            surrounding the whole affair.</p>
                        <p>The radical and German-bribed press has been using the Standard Oil as a
                            basis for frequent attacks against Ostria Gutiérrez and other members of
                            the Cabinet, and of course this does not help American-Bolivian
                            relations. The Government means well, and, I am sure, would gladly
                            settle the case along the lines the Department wishes, but it is a
                            feeble and easily frightened Government and the opposition is much
                            stronger than was expected. Moreover, this opposition is encouraged and
                            assisted in every possible way by the Germans who are bent on destroying
                            American influence in this part of the world, if they can.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez’s troubles in trying to settle the Standard Oil case
                            are largely of his own making … At the same time, it does not seem wise
                            on our part to allow a troublesome question like the Standard Oil case
                            to remain open like a festering sore, if any means can be found to
                            dispose of it, or ease it in some way. Of course if the Chamber follows
                            the example of the Senate and approves the administration’s efforts to
                            reach a settlement with the company, matters should clear up without any
                            help on our part, but should the Chamber fail to take action before
                            adjournment the end of this month, the whole question will be left open
                            and in worse condition, from our point of view, than before the
                            discussions in Congress started.</p>
                        <p>If this does happen, and I fear it will, it has occurred to me the
                            Department may wish to consider some plan to put the position of our <pb
                                n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0486"/>Government in a more favorable
                            and truthful light in the eyes of Bolivians than it seems to be at
                            present. For the moment, I confess I have no idea just what could be
                            done except, perhaps, that the Department may give out a statement of a
                            conciliatory sort and emphasizing that there is no economic boycott of
                            this country, as has been alleged in some of the pro-German newspapers.
                            I do not wish to suggest the Department should abandon its stand to
                            discourage economic loans pending a settlement of the Standard Oil case,
                            but only that something be done to try to alleviate the unfortunate
                            impression now prevalent in Bolivia as a result of the discussions in
                            Congress. Some such announcement might strengthen the hands of those
                            friendly to us in the Government and tend to create a healthier
                            atmosphere in American-Bolivian relations generally, which is highly
                            desirable at this time.</p>

                            April 28, 1941, concerning the Standard Oil case, I now have the honor
                            to report that the Bolivian Congress adjourned on April 30 without any
                            action having been taken by the Chamber of Deputies on the Government’s
                            proposal to settle this matter.</p>
                        <p>I called at the Foreign Office on May 3rd about another question, and I
                            took advantage of the opportunity to mention the Standard Oil case to
                            Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez. I pointed out that the Chamber had failed to vote
                            on the Government’s plan and asked him what he thought would now be done
                            toward a settlement. The Minister shrugged his shoulders and said he did
                            not know. The Government had done everything it could, he said, to try
                            to arrange for a settlement, but without success and he believed it
                            would be best for all concerned if the case could be allowed to rest
                            “until the end of the war”.</p>
                        <p>While I do not think the Department should abandon its position in
                            insisting upon some sort of settlement, I am prepared to admit I
                            entertain little or no hope that the present regime will do anything
                            more in the case, and I am inclined to agree with Dr. Ostria Gutiérrez
                            that we may just as well let it rest in abeyance until there are changes
                            in the personnel of the Cabinet which may lead to the expectation of a
                            more vigorous policy in the foreign affairs of Bolivia.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0487"/>
                        <p>As I pointed out in a previous despatch, the difficulties of the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs are increased by the fact that German influence is
                            brought to bear on the radical opposition in parliament and the pro-Nazi
                            press and everything is being done by these elements to frustrate the
                            Government’s plans for better relations with the United States. The
                            administration lacks the courage and determination to put up a vigorous
                            fight, and I am inclined to suggest that, while the policy of
                            discouraging ordinary loans is continued, it may be a good idea to look
                            with favor upon loans for the construction of certain highways and also
                            perhaps to assist the Army in the purchase of equipment.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to suggest, however, that loans of this sort should be made
                            without the most careful consideration, and if money is advanced for the
                            construction of highways, for instance, I believe it should be provided
                            that the work would have to be done under the direction of American
                            engineers and all machinery and supplies purchased in the United States.
                            And as to a possibility of a loan for military purposes, it goes without
                            saying that we should first be sure of the friendliness of the Bolivian
                            General Staff and leading officers before any steps could be taken in
                            that direction. Granted the proper conditions, I believe that assistance
                            in the construction of highways in this country would tend to build up a
                            friendly feeling for us amongst the Bolivian people, and, as has been
                            already pointed out by the Legation, everything within reason should be
                            done to win the good will of Bolivian army officers who are the most
                            important political factor in Bolivia at this time.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to know whether or not the Department considers these
                            suggestions at all feasible.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that present Bolivian tin production falls
                            considerably short of the permissible export quota for Bolivia now
                            obtaining under the International Tin Restriction Scheme (130 per cent
                            of standard tonnage), it would be possible for the permissible export
                            quota for Bolivia to be substantially reduced without requiring a
                            reduction in the present level of Bolivian production. In such
                            circumstances, however, the formula suggested in the British Embassy’s
                            Memorandum of February 6, 1941 might actually result in an obligation on
                            the part of Bolivia to deliver a larger proportion of its production to
                            British smelters than it will deliver in the twelve months ending June
                            30, 1941. Correspondingly, unless it were possible to increase
                            production, Bolivian producers would be unable to fulfill their
                            obligations to Metals Reserve Company, although actual <pb n="479"
                                xml:id="pg_479" facs="0489"/>Bolivian production would not have been
                            decreased by any action of the International Tin Committee.</p>
                        <p>It is not believed that this was the intent desired to be accomplished by
                            the formula proposed. The difficulty referred to above would be avoided
                            were the clause to be worded as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the event that the export quota of Bolivia under the
                                    International Tin Restriction Scheme is reduced below the amount
                                    of present Bolivian production, then the tonnage of tin metal in
                                    the ore to be made available from Bolivia to the United Kingdom
                                    shall bear the same proportion to the total exports of tin metal
                                    permitted to Bolivia under the International Tin Restriction
                                    Scheme as exports to the United Kingdom bear to total Bolivian
                                    production during the twelve months ending June 30, 1941.”</p>

                            British Government point out that the International Tin Restriction

                        <p>12. The British and Bolivian Governments are evidently engaged in
                            negotiating an agreement regarding the exportation of Bolivian tin to
                            the United Kingdom. In this connection they have submitted the following
                            clause for comment by the Department:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the quotation in the British Embassy’s memorandum of
                            February 14, printed <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The foregoing clause is entirely acceptable in principle to the
                            Department as closely paralleling the similar clause in the United
                            States-Bolivian tin agreement. Before replying, however, the Department
                            desires certain factual information as to the formula suggested which
                            uses exports in the 12 months ending June 30, 1941 as the base period.
                            This is the first full year of the United States-Bolivian tin contract
                            but the Department understands that because the agreement was
                            retroactive for a part of the period, some of the small and medium
                            producers continued to ship to the United Kingdom until approximately
                            January 1, 1941. The Department would therefore like to receive your
                            opinion as to whether for the 12 months in question Bolivian tin exports
                            to the United Kingdom will be substantially in the ratio which was
                            envisaged when the United States contract was concluded—i. e., that
                            slightly over half of total Bolivian exports would move to the United
                            Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Reply is requested as promptly as possible.</p>

                        <p>16. Department’s 12, February 15, 2 p.m. Negotiations referred to have
                            been under way in La Paz since late October as indicated in my despatch
                            No. 579, January 13 and Department’s instruction No. 145, January
                                31<note n="22" xml:id="d488fn1">Neither printed.</note> but are not
                            likely to be concluded before end of February. British representative
                            has kept Legation fully informed in general but has never mentioned
                            clause in question.</p>
                        <p>Legation’s impression is that, if quotas were reduced, clause as drafted
                            would result in the United States receiving substantially <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0491"/>less than half of Bolivian tin
                            production because of continuation of exports to Great Britain during
                            the last half of 1940 by some exporters who are now selling to the
                            United States. Ratio originally envisaged would probably be assured if
                            basis of formula were changed to exports in 6 months ending June 30,
                            1941 or 12 months ending December 31, 1941 inasmuch as the current
                            semester is the first in which the effects of United States-Bolivian tin
                            contract have become fully operative. It is to be hoped that the
                            Department will request such a change in the clause if it desires ratio
                            maintained. Otherwise second sentence of paragraph 2 of United
                            States-Bolivian tin contract may conflict with British clause.</p>
                        <p>Figures by countries of destination on exports of tin from Bolivia for
                            second half of 1940 have not been made public but I will endeavor to
                            obtain them and submit further report by telegraph. In their absence I
                            estimate that British clause might result in reduction of American
                            receipts to as low as one-third of Bolivia’s exportation instead of
                            contemplated ratio of almost 50%.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the British Embassy’s Memorandum of February 14, 1941
                            transmitting the proposed text of an article for a United
                            Kingdom-Bolivia tin ore agreement, the Department of State submits the
                            following comments: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Department is, of course, entirely agreeable in principle
                                    to the article in question and to its objective.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It appears, however, that the precise language of the
                                    suggested article may still fail to achieve the objective
                                    sought. Some Bolivian exporters who are now selling to Metals
                                    Reserve Company under the contract of November 4, 1940 did,
                                    during the last half of 1940, continue to export to the United
                                    Kingdom. The second half of 1940 therefore scarcely represented
                                    a typical period in the operation of the newly concluded
                                    contract of Metals Reserve Company, and it is not certain that
                                    this deviation will be entirely evened out in the first six
                                    months of 1941. If the basis of the formula suggested in the
                                    Embassy’s note were changed to refer to Bolivian exports in the
                                    six months ending June 30, 1941, or in the twelve months ending
                                    December 31, 1941, it is believed that any difficulties of this
                                    nature would be obviated.</item>

                        <p>1120. For Feis. The British Treasury is concerned about the request of
                            the Metals Reserve Company, made through the Department, that the
                            conclusion of its negotiations with Bolivia for a payments agreement be
                            postponed and it would very much appreciate if the matter could be given
                            immediate consideration by us. The British Treasury has written
                            informally to the Embassy recounting the history of its negotiations and
                            the concluding two paragraphs are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In October the Treasury and the Bank of England sent out to La
                                    Paz a special representative, J. Phillimore, who has been
                                    carrying <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0493"/>through the
                                    negotiations with all the Bolivian interests concerned. On the
                                    14th February all the material points of difference having at
                                    last been composed, we sent him, at his request, a draft text of
                                    the inter-governmental agreement and we sent a copy at the same
                                    time to Washington for communication to the State
                                    Department.</p>
                                <p>“Things were boiling up for the moment of signature and
                                    Phillimore was making arrangements for his departure to Buenos
                                    Aires when we received from Lord Halifax a telegram saying that
                                    he had been approached by the State Department who told him that
                                    the M.R.C. had been studying the draft text of our agreement and
                                    ‘would greatly appreciate ample further opportunity to consider
                                    its bearing on American plans before it is concluded.’ You will
                                    appreciate the very embarrassing position in which this request
                                    places us. Throughout the negotiations we have tried to keep in
                                    touch with Washington and we sent our Embassy the draft of our
                                    complete agreement as much as 5 weeks ago. An interruption of
                                    the negotiations at this eleventh hour might quite easily undo
                                    our efforts over the last 8 months and wreck the whole
                                    agreement. It was extremely difficult to find a wording which,
                                    to the lawyer’s eye, safeguards in cast-iron form the interest
                                    of the Bolivians, the M.R.C., and ourselves, but looking at it
                                    from the practical point of view, one can say in three words
                                    that we have every desire to recognize the requirements of the
                                    M.R.C. and to collaborate fairly and sportingly with them and
                                    that, once the Bolivian factor is eliminated, and the agreement
                                    signed, any dubious points as between the M.R.C. and ourselves
                                    could be quite appropriately and conveniently covered by notes
                                    exchanged at Washington. We do not know yet precisely in what
                                    articles of the draft text the M.R.C. see grounds for misgiving
                                    but in all honesty we can say that we have not the faintest
                                    thought of stealing a march on them, and that our only urgent
                                    desire at this moment is to tie up the Bolivian output (i.e. as
                                    I have said above between the United States and the United
                                    Kingdom) so that at least the triangle becomes a straight line
                                    and the M.R.C. and ourselves can work out points of detail
                                    without reference to South America.”</p>

                            the draft text, as amended, of the proposed United Kingdom-Bolivian
                            agreement on tin ore. The opportunity thus afforded for comment in
                            advance of conclusion of the agreement is highly appreciated as is also
                            the friendly spirit which has animated the several informal explanations
                            of purpose which have been addressed <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484"
                                facs="0494"/>to the Department and to the American Embassy in
                            London. In this same spirit the following observations are made in
                            reply:</p>
                        <p>1. It appears that the purpose of the agreement is to ensure that all
                            Bolivian tin ores and concentrates not exported to the United States
                            would be exported only to the United Kingdom. In the light of the
                            present state of emergency in both the United States and the United
                            Kingdom, this is an objective in which the United States Government
                            entirely concurs.</p>
                        <p>2. Does it not appear to the British Government that this purpose would
                            be effectively accomplished, while at the same time eliminating certain
                            other questions raised by the agreement which would otherwise call for
                            detailed comment on the part of the United States Government, if Article
                            1 were amended to read somewhat as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Bolivian Government shall by all means in their power ensure
                                    that the whole of the Bolivian output of tin ore of high,
                                    medium, or low grades which is not now under contract for
                                    exportation to the United States will be made available for
                                    shipment to smelters in the United Kingdom or in the United
                                    States …</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>3. The purpose of the foregoing suggestion is merely to make clear to the
                            three Governments concerned that the contract of November 4, 1940
                            between Metals Reserve Company and certain Bolivian producers is not to
                            be regarded as fixing the absolute maximum of Bolivian ores that might
                            be obtained by the United States regardless of what circumstances may
                            arise in the future.</p>
                        <p>4. If the flexibility suggested above were to be introduced into the
                            agreement, Article 10 would then become at least partly inconsistent
                            with the revised Article 1 and, it is believed, could be safely omitted
                            entirely. The contract of Metals Reserve Company of November 4, 1940
                            provides for reduction in the amounts of ores and concentrates to be
                            acquired by Metals Reserve in the event of reduction of permissible
                            Bolivian exports under the International Tin Control. The permissive
                            nature of the language on this point has been a matter of concern to the
                            British Government and the United States Government is entirely willing
                            again to record its intention that the language shall be interpreted as
                            mandatory rather than merely permissive. In these circumstances there
                            would be no question of Metals Reserve purchases absorbing more than
                            their proportionate share of the Bolivian output and it would
                            automatically ensue that the remainder would be available to British
                            smelters except as agreement might have been reached to provide
                            additional amounts to the United States.</p>
                        <p>5. In referring thus to possible additional quantities of Bolivian ore to
                            be made available to the United States, the Government of the United
                            States has at this time no specific thought or purpose in mind. <pb
                                n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0495"/>In view of the unusual
                            disturbances in world production and trade, it is readily apparent,
                            however, that the United States Government might at some time in the
                            future desire to approach the British Government for an arrangement by
                            which it might have an option on some of the ores contracted for by
                            British smelters in the same way that it has willingly given a
                            corresponding option to the British Government.</p>
                        <p>6. It goes without saying, of course, that the United States Government
                            would anticipate that no contracts concluded by British smelters under
                            the terms of the British-Bolivian agreement would operate in any manner
                            to prevent the fullfilment by Bolivian producers of the terms of the
                            agreement of the Metals Reserve Company of November 4, 1940, or any
                            renewal thereof. The United States Government is, as is known, engaged
                            in constructing a smelter to treat Bolivian ores. The decision to take
                            this step was based on considerations of national defense, and in the
                            present circumstances these considerations are of importance to the
                            United Kingdom as well as to this country. Further, the erection and
                            operation of this smelter is intended as a continuing activity in the
                            United States and not merely as a temporary activity in the present
                            emergency. It is quite possible that the effective life of the proposed
                            British-Bolivian agreement might extend beyond the period of Metals
                            Reserve Company’s contract and the United States Government would, of
                            course, expect that nothing in the British-Bolivian agreement would
                            operate to prevent a renewal of the American contract beyond its present
                            term.</p>

                            forward the observations in their memorandum of March 25th.</p>
                        <p>We are sure that the State Department will appreciate our anxiety over
                            our supplies of Bolivian tin ore which, up to the end of last year, had
                            always been shipped almost wholly for smelting in the United Kingdom.
                            Our position was fully explained by the British Embassy to the State
                            Department last October. Quite apart from our natural desire to support
                            a great industry, the maintenance of deliveries from Bolivia is of
                            paramount importance during the war emergency as a valuable supply of
                            metal and a means of conserving dollars.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons we were very greatly concerned at the news of the
                            conclusion of the Metals Reserve Company contract in November, <pb
                                n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0496"/>which meant a serious cut into
                            this supply and these dollar assets; and we welcomed the assurance of
                            the United States Government that they had no intention of taking more
                            than a maximum of 18,000 tons per annum and would share with us any fall
                            in exports necessitated by decisions under the tin restriction scheme.
                            We do not therefore clearly understand paragraph 3 of State Department
                            memorandum of March 25th.</p>
                        <p>We had no other consideration in mind when drafting the text of our
                            agreement with the Bolivian Government and we can immediately reply to
                            the questions contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the State Department
                            memorandum of March 25th. In the conditions set out in paragraph 5 we
                            should always be ready for full and cordial discussion with the United
                            States Government, bearing in mind our necessity as to the supply of tin
                            and dollars and our regard for our smelting interests and the
                            long-established tin trade with Bolivia. As to paragraph 6, we fully
                            recognise that the Metals Reserve Company smelter is a permanent
                            undertaking and that the company will wish to reserve the right to renew
                            their contract. We have had no thought, nor do we desire in any way to
                            prejudice, such renewal.</p>
                        <p>As to paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, our primary object was to ensure that all
                            Bolivian tin which did not go to the United States was secured for the
                            United Kingdom. It is important to note that the assurance of the United
                            States Government referred to in paragraph 3 above operates only
                            vis-à-vis the Metals Reserve Company. It does not bind the Bolivian
                            Government, nor the Bolivian producers, under their contract with Metals
                            Reserve Company. For their maximum of 18,000 tons remains irrespective
                            of the decisions by the International Tin Committee as to the total
                            permissible exports from Bolivia, so long as the total is above 18,000
                            tons. In other words, if Bolivian exports were 18,000 tons, all of that
                            would be sent to the United States under the existing contract; the
                            United Kingdom would then get nothing. We doubt whether this vital point
                            has been appreciated and it constitutes our primary reason for including
                            Article 10 in our draft agreement. If the wording proposed in paragraph
                            2 of State Department memorandum of March 25th and the omission of
                            Article 10 suggested in paragraph 4 were accepted we should have no
                            guarantee, apart from the smelting contracts with individual Bolivian
                            producers, for what they are worth, that any tin at all would come to
                            the United Kingdom. That would be an impossible position.</p>
                        <p>We were able to persuade Patiño<note n="24" xml:id="d493fn1">Simón I.
                                Patiño, president of Patiño Mines and Enterprises.</note> to
                            conclude the long-term contract with United Kingdom smelters because he
                            was satisfied that he had no alternative outlet; we have met him to the
                            limit of our resources but we fear he would not scruple to tear up his
                            contract if he saw the opportunity of better terms with the United
                            States, and <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0497"/>the wording which
                            the State Department memorandum proposes would, we think, provide that
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the assurances given by the Metals Reserve Company that
                            they have no intention of increasing their imports from Bolivia, and
                            with this explanation of our position, including our ready acceptance
                            mentioned above of the views expressed in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the
                            State Department memorandum, we trust that their objection to our
                            Articles 1 and 10 will be withdrawn.</p>

                            <p>In communicating the foregoing message, the Commercial Counsellor of
                                the British Embassy enquired whether a satisfactory solution could

                                from Article 1 (as amended in paragraph 2 of the State Department

                        <p>Mr. Feis briefly reviewed the background of Anglo-American relations on
                            tin in connection with the negotiation of Metals Reserve Company’s
                            contract with Bolivian producers and in connection with the
                            British-Bolivian tin negotiations.</p>
                        <p>He then gave Mr. Jones a copy of the Department’s Memorandum of March 25
                            to the British Embassy embodying the request, suggested by Mr. Will
                            Clayton, Deputy Loan Administrator, that the British-Bolivian agreement
                            be simplified so that it would merely provide that all Bolivian tin not
                            supplied to Metals Reserve under its contract of November 4, 1940 would
                            be exported only to smelters in the United Kingdom or in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>He then added that the British had now come back again with an <hi

                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jones read part of the Department’s Memorandum of March 25 and
                            reiterated concurrence with the position expressed therein and expressed
                            his dissatisfaction with the continued insistence of the British in this
                            matter. He said that while this Government was <pb n="488"
                                xml:id="pg_488" facs="0498"/>engaged in giving extensive assistance
                            to the British Government, the British on their part in this matter
                            “kept nibbling at us like young ducks”. He said that he would reread
                            with care the Memorandum of March 25 and would look over the British
                            Memorandum of April 3, which he was informed is badly muddled, and added
                            that he would be very glad to express his point of view directly to the
                            British Ambassador or to Sir Frederick Phillips<note n="25"

                            ore, and to subsequent exchanges of views with the State Department,
                            particularly at the meeting which the Commercial Counsellor of the

                                    purpose the words “at any time during the period ending June 30,
                                    1945” have been inserted after the commencing words of the

                        <p>At the request of the Bolivian Government, Article 8 of the Agreement has

                            February 17th<note n="29" xml:id="d495fn3">Not printed.</note> is the
                            insertion in Article 1 after the words “ensure that” of the words:

                            between the two contracting Governments”. The British Government agreed
                            to this insertion on insistent pressure from the Bolivian Government who
                            urged that there existed in Bolivia small smelters capable of producing
                            up to 5000 tons of fine tin annually and that other smelters now under
                            construction in the country would have a capacity of 3000 tons, while
                            very small quantities of tin ore were occasionally shipped to small
                            smelters in Argentina.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the British Embassy’s memorandum of April 25, 1941
                            transmitting the information that the British Government has accepted
                            the amendments to the draft United Kingdom-Bolivian Agreement on tin ore
                            which was suggested at the meeting held by the Deputy Federal Loan
                            Administrator and the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy on
                            April 10, and that instructions had been issued to the British Minister
                            at La Paz to incorporate appropriate verbal changes in the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State is gratified that it has been possible to reach
                            this full agreement between the British and the United States
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the only substantive change in the text of the agreement
                            beyond the points referred to above is the insertion in Article 1 after
                            the words “ensure that” of the words: “apart from such specified amounts
                            as shall from time to time be agreed between the two contracting
                            Governments”. The United States Government has no desire to comment upon
                            this amendment other than to record its understanding that the release
                            of the specified amounts would in no way affect the tonnage which Metals
                            Reserve Company would be entitled to receive from Bolivia in the event
                            of a reduction of permissible Bolivian exports to a level at which the
                            pertinent provisions of Article 2 of the Metals Reserve Company contract
                            of November 4, 1940 and Article 10 of the United Kingdom-Bolivian
                            Agreement would become operative.</p>

                            of the United States of Brazil that the War Department has received a
                            memorandum entitled “Bases for the Establishment of an Agreement of
                            Cooperation between the United States of North America and Brazil”,
                            handed to representatives of that Department by General Góes Monteiro,
                            the Chief of Staff of the Army of Brazil, on October 29, 1940.<note

                                the Pan American Union were attacked by an extra-Continental nation,
                                Brazil would aid by furnishing raw materials, extending the use of
                                its naval and air bases in existence or in building, permit the
                                transit of its territory by friendly powers, strengthen its military
                                establishment by building more air and naval bases, improving its
                                coast defenses, mobilizing its fighting force, and organizing its
                                interior ways of communication and its war industries. For its part
                                the United States was to undertake to guard the north and northeast
                                coast, assist in Brazil’s acquisition of war materials, receive raw
                                materials in payment for manufactured products, and provide
                                technical aid to Brazilian engineers and workmen. Brazil reserved to
                                itself a neutral status in conflicts limited to countries of North

                        <p>The text of the proposed agreements contained in this memorandum has been
                            carefully studied by the appropriate officials of the War Department in
                            pursuance of which this Department has received a letter from the
                            Secretary of War<note n="2a" xml:id="d497fn2">Letter dated December 3,
                                1940, from Secretary of War Stimson not printed.</note> recommending
                            that the Brazilian Government be informed that his Department considers
                            them generally satisfactory as a basis for mutual cooperation between
                            the Armies of Brazil and of the United States in Hemisphere Defense. The
                            War Department, however, prior to recommending a definitive acceptance
                            of these proposed agreements desires to obtain certain changes in the
                            text. These modifications are set forth in the accompanying
                                memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d497fn3">Not printed.</note> They

                        <p>You will, therefore, please state to the Brazilian authorities that the
                            War Department wishes to discuss these proposed changes by means of
                            further staff conversations to be held preferably at Washington with
                            such representative as the Brazilian Government may designate. It would
                            appear in this connection that the presence in the United States of
                            General Amaro Bittencourt<note n="4" xml:id="d497fn4">Brazilian Military
                                Attaché in the United States.</note> may be considered to afford a
                            suitable opportunity for such conversations.</p>
                        <p>The War Department also states that it would appreciate it if in addition
                            to authorizing a continuation of the staff conversations with the Chief
                            of the United States Military Mission in Brazil<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d497fn5">Col. Lehman W. Miller.</note> the Brazilian
                            Government would designate a representative authorized to discuss the
                            same matters with the representatives of that Department in Washington.
                            The War Department will, of course, keep the Chief of the United States
                            Military Mission in Brazil fully informed of the matters discussed and
                            the action taken as a result of the staff conversations which take place
                            here.</p>

                                    reinforcements could arrive from the United States; (2) the

                            situation which is developing in the Atlantic to enhance its patrol
                            activities. The Navy Department is of the opinion that in accordance
                            with the spirit of the staff talks between Brazil and the United States,
                            an urgent situation has arisen involving the need to take additional
                            measures of protection to insure the safety and security of the Western
                            Hemisphere. It desires, therefore, to know whether the Brazilian
                            Government would be willing to permit at this time vessels of the United
                            States Navy engaged in such patrol activities to utilize the ports of
                            Bahia and Pernambuco for the purpose of overhauling and of obtaining
                            repair facilities. The Navy would likewise desire occasionally to have
                            tenders and tankers put into these two ports for refueling, et
                            cetera.</p>

                            trust and confidence than with the Government of Brazil. As Aranha
                            knows, I have made it a practice ever since I have occupied this office
                            to communicate to the Government of Brazil all information which this
                            Government received which I have believed would be of value to the
                            Brazilian Government. I also have been most grateful for the information
                            which Aranha has frequently given to you and which has been most
                            valuable to us here.</p>
                        <p>If this Government has failed at any time to make its position fully
                            clear to the Brazilian Government, although I do not think it has, I
                            should be the first to regret it. I wish you would add in this
                            connection that any specific question that Aranha cares to ask you or
                            that his Ambassador here cares to ask me would be immediately <pb

                            upon Brazilian public opinion which recent German victories have had, I
                            may make the following statements:</p>
                        <p>The President has requested the Ambassadors and Ministers of the other
                            American Republics to meet with him at the White House next Tuesday
                            night when he broadcasts an address<note n="13" xml:id="d501fn3">For
                                text of the President’s address May 27, 1941, see Department of

                            intended particularly for the people of the United States and the people
                            of the other American Republics. I believe that this address will answer
                            many of the questions which may be in Aranha’s mind and in the minds of
                            many of the Brazilian people.</p>
                        <p>I think, however, that you should state to Aranha that in our considered
                            judgment the German Government and its allies can never achieve victory
                            so long as they do not obtain mastery of the seas, and particularly of
                            the Atlantic. The United States will never permit the passage of the
                            control of the seas, and particularly the Atlantic, into the hands of
                            powers which are clearly bent solely on world conquest and world
                            domination and which have as their major objective <pb n="496"
                                xml:id="pg_496" facs="0506"/>the enslavement of all free peoples,
                            including the twenty-one American nations. That is a fundamental
                            principle in our present policy since we regard it as the prime
                            requisite for the insurance of the defense and security of the United
                            States and of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>With regard to this final point I leave it to your discretion whether to
                            communicate it to Aranha or directly to President Vargas. It is in the
                            highest degree confidential at this time, but the President personally
                            authorized me to communicate through you to President Vargas the fact
                            that a very considerable portion of the United States fleet is now
                            travelling under secret orders from the Pacific to the Atlantic and that
                            this portion of the fleet will be in the Atlantic by June 8. The
                            developments of the past weeks affecting the Atlantic have caused the
                            President to reach the decision that this part of the fleet must without
                            further delay be utilized in the Atlantic Ocean to safeguard the
                            interests of the United States and its American neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I shall appreciate it if after you have had your conversation with Aranha
                            or with President Vargas you will telegraph their reaction and any
                            comment they may make. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>581. My telegram No. 570, June 2, 4 p.m.<note n="16" xml:id="d503fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> I assume it will be obvious to the Department that
                            if, after raising the high hopes of President Vargas, Aranha and the
                            Minister for Air, we were to fail to let them have the bombers they
                            would be disgusted and resentful.</p>
                        <p>I must respectfully again point out that the Brazilian authorities have
                            been putting into effect a series of hemisphere defense measures solely
                            because we asked them to do so: Yesterday arrived officers from our War
                            Department for a medical survey in northeast Brazil; we are now engaged
                            in negotiations for taking aerial photographs of the northeast region
                            for our own use; we are now asking the Brazilian Army to be allowed to
                            participate in their maneuvers in the northeast region; we are now
                            asking the Brazilian Army to permit us to bring some of our General
                            Staff here for defense conversations; we are now asking the Brazilian
                            authorities to allow 20 English bombers to be flown over Brazilian
                            territory; we succeeded in persuading the Brazilians to agree to
                            prohibit the sale of strategic materials to the Axis powers; we secured
                            the cooperation of the Brazilian authorities in constructing a whole
                            series of air bases; we suggested that troops be moved to the northeast
                            and the Brazilians are moving them; at our suggestion the Brazilian Navy
                            is undertaking to construct a naval base at Natal; and many more
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Air Ministry has assigned personnel to work with our Air
                            Mission to get ready to receive the bombers.</p>
                        <p>The Germans are continuing to offer to send arms here. General Góes
                            Monteiro told General Miller a few days ago that the Germans have
                            offered to send a cargo of German arms on a German ship to Brazil.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this telegram because I apprehend that the Brazilian
                            authorities will be unwilling to continue indefinitely to do everything
                            we ask them to when we may appear to them to be remiss on our side. I
                            am, of course, fully aware that we made no commitments to General Amaro
                            Bittencourt to furnish arms now or in the near future.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Jeff</hi>: I am submitting to you herewith a
                            copy of a memorandum dated June 17 which has been sent to me by General
                            Marshall at my request and which, as you will see from the contents of
                            the memorandum, is approved by Admiral Stark.<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d504fn1">Adm. Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval
                                Operations.</note></p>
                        <p>The memorandum is so comprehensive that I believe it requires no
                            explanation from me. The real question, as I stated to General Marshall,
                            is whether in your opinion the ends sought will be achieved through your
                            speaking personally with President Vargas along the lines set forth in
                            this memorandum. That, I feel, can only be left to your own
                            determination. If you feel that it is desirable for you to see President
                            Vargas and submit the problem to him as it is set forth in this
                            memorandum, you are authorized to do so immediately.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph me what your decision may be and, of course, should you
                            see President Vargas, what reply may be made.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>Yours ever,</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Military Cooperation of Brazil.</p>
                            <p>1. In the Liaison Committee<note n="18" xml:id="d504fn2">The Liaison
                                    Committee was a high level interdepartmental policy group
                                    primarily concerned with defense matters.</note> meeting of June
                                10, you requested a memorandum setting forth just what the War
                                Department desires in Northeast Brazil. It is my understanding that
                                you wish to transmit these desires to Ambassador Caffery with
                                instructions that he is to present them in person to President
                                Vargas and request of him that they be granted.</p>
                            <p>2. With respect to Brazil, the War and Navy Departments have a single
                                objective, the attainment of which at the earliest possible moment
                                is of great concern to this country. Both Departments are in
                                complete accord, both as to the objective and as to the time within
                                which it should be secured. That objective is to insure the security
                                of Northeast Brazil against every Axis effort, within Axis
                                capabilities, <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0509"/>to obtain a
                                lodgment there. The War and Navy Departments believe that the
                                Brazilian forces now in that area do not and cannot provide such
                                security. They further believe that such forces as Brazil can and
                                may transfer to that region will still fail to provide timely
                                security to the extent deemed essential for our interests.</p>
                            <p>3. The question of sovereignty presents a problem to Brazil. Short of
                                war, this problem may prove insolvable. But until we have made every
                                effort to solve it and failed, we have not established this
                                fact.</p>
                            <p>4. It may seem trite to repeat the strategic reasons why the War and
                                Navy Departments consider this matter of such vital import and
                                urgency to our safety. The basic geographic facts are well
                                illustrated on the attached map.<note n="19" xml:id="d504fn3">Not
                                    reproduced.</note> It is within the capabilities of the Axis
                                powers to establish small forces in Northeast Brazil before
                                effective armed resistance could be interposed by United States
                                forces. On June 10 this Government had no naval craft, surface,
                                sub-surface or air, within 1,000 miles of the tip of Brazil and the
                                nearest Army force was nearly twice that distance. Our line of
                                communications to that area today would be almost wholly sea-borne.
                                While our long and medium range aircraft could readily reach it by
                                air, our short range aircraft could do so only at great hazard.</p>
                            <p>5. The military problem presented, both from the Axis point of view
                                and ours, is characterized by one outstanding fact. A small force in
                                initial occupation will compel a major effort to expel it. Such an
                                effort in that theater is highly undesirable and the risk of being
                                compelled to make it should not be accepted. That risk exists today.
                                It will continue so long as we fail to provide the security forces
                                essential for that area.</p>

                            <p>7. Time is the essential factor. Germany cannot <hi rend="italic"
                                    >today</hi> move in strength in the one manner in which she must
                                move in order to secure and hold a lodgment in Brazil, namely, by
                                sea. But step by step, the range of German armed force has been
                                extended in that direction. German submarines are operating off the
                                West African coast, presumably supplied either from the Canary
                                Islands or from French or Spanish West African colonies. Dakar,
                                former terminus of the <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0510"
                                />German trans-Atlantic air route, is ruled from Vichy and Vichy
                                collaborates with Germany. German four-motored planes, capable of
                                flying the South Atlantic, are now in service. Germany has pilots
                                and navigators familiar with the South Atlantic crossing. On three
                                occasions within the past six months, German surface merchant
                                vessels have run the British blockade from Europe to Brazilian
                                ports. In view of these known facts and the rapidity with which
                                Germany develops operations once her preparations are complete, we
                                now face the distinct possibility of a lodgment by small German
                                forces in Northeast Brazil which would require a very strong effort
                                on our part to dislodge. Once our security forces are there, that
                                possibility will be eliminated. It will then require a strong German
                                effort to dislodge us, and the probability of such an effort being
                                made will be relatively small.</p>
                            <p>8. Admiral Stark and I are in full accord in this matter. We believe
                                that the objectives of this Government should be as stated in the
                                report of The Joint Planning Committee of June 4, 1941,<note n="21"
                                    xml:id="d504fn5">Report not printed; the Joint Planning
                                    Committee was set up by and reported to the Joint Planning Board
                                    (Army and Navy).</note> namely that this Government should
                                secure immediately the consent of the Government of Brazil to the
                                movement of United States Army and Navy security forces to Northeast
                                Brazil, and that concurrently Colombia and Venezuela should be asked
                                to cooperate by permitting the transit of their territory and the
                                use of their airfields by our armed aircraft.</p>
                            <p>We further believe that such evidence of our vigorous leadership in
                                the defense of this Hemisphere will be very heartening to friendly
                                Latin American Governments and will strengthen them in their support
                                of our policies.</p>
                            <p>9. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. The Army forces recommended for use
                                under the present military situation include aviation, anti-aircraft
                                artillery, infantry, field artillery, and service elements totalling
                                approximately 9,300 troops and 43 planes.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi>. The bulk of these forces should be sent
                                initially to Natal. Eventually detachments may be sent to Recife and
                                possibly to the Island of Fernando Noronha.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">c</hi>. The War and Navy Departments have the
                                forces available, together with necessary shipping to transport
                                them, and can commence the movement from our Atlantic seaboard on
                                twenty (20) days’ notice, provided no large scale overseas movements
                                are then underway to other points.</p>
                            <p>10. I am of the opinion that our best chance of securing the desired
                                consent of the Brazilian Government would be through a personal
                                request from President Roosevelt to President Vargas.</p>
                            <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0511"/>
                            <p>Participation in its maneuvers can be publicly announced by Brazil as
                                the reason for permitting entry of our forces, but the reasons given
                                above should be frankly stated to President Vargas.</p>
                            <p>The real hazard, however, which probably should not be mentioned to
                                President Vargas, lies not in the danger of an unsupported attack by
                                German forces. The greatest peril in this situation lies in the
                                possibility of a sudden seizure of airfields and ports in Northeast
                                Brazil by forces already in the country and acting in collusion with
                                small German forces. The latter, arriving by air and perhaps by sea,
                                would so time their movement as to arrive at these points
                                immediately after their seizure. They would at once take over and
                                organize these points for defense.</p>
                            <p>Admiral Stark shares these opinions.</p>

                        <p>471. My secret airmail letter to you, June 18. The situation is changing
                            with great rapidity and the possibility of German aggression against the
                            Western Hemisphere is becoming more imminent. In the considered judgment
                            of the President and of the service heads of the War and Navy
                            Departments, the most vulnerable points from the standpoint of the
                            security of the Western Hemisphere are Iceland<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d505fn1">For correspondence regarding agreement with the
                                Icelandic Government for sending of American troops to assume
                                protection of Iceland, see <ref target="frus1941v02#pg_776">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, pp. 776</ref> ff.</note> and
                            Natal. Should the German Government be enabled in the near future to
                            obtain control of Dakar, it is probable that Germany would then
                            undertake its classic pincer strategy by attempting to occupy Iceland
                            and Natal, the objective being, of course through the use of air forces
                            based upon those regions to cut off Great Britain from the supplies now
                            reaching her across the North Atlantic and from the South Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>The President feels that under these circumstances the approach outlined
                            in my letter should be made and that the considerations above mentioned
                            should be made clear. I believe that probably the pretext of maneuvers
                            would be the best explanation to give so far as the public is concerned,
                            but that is, of course a question which can be determined in the light
                            of any recommendations or wishes that may be expressed to you. The
                            underlying basis, however, would be the provision in existing
                            inter-American agreements that any two or more American republics shall
                            undertake such arrangements for their joint defense as they may consider
                            necessary and desirable.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0512"/>
                        <p>The President asks me to let you know that he considers the matter urgent
                            and I shall therefore appreciate your telegraphing me your immediate
                            views and any suggestions as to the manner of handling the question
                            which you consider desirable.</p>

                        <p>736. For the Under Secretary. Department’s telegram No. 471, June 26, 4
                            p.m. I talked this over with Aranha: His offhand reaction was this:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows report of statement by Aranha that it would be a mistake to
                            ask President Vargas to permit the sending of United States troops to
                            northern Brazil, especially in view of the failure of the United States
                            to supply arms for the Brazilian Army.]</p>
                        <p>Aranha has put into words what represents my opinion on this subject.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, President Vargas has been leaning more and
                            more in our direction during the past few months. He is definitely on
                            our side but certainly the moment has not yet arrived when he could
                            agree to this proposal and get away with it. He would think that I
                            should know better than to put it up to him in this way at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>I asked Aranha if he thought it would improve matters any if we invited
                            Brazilian forces to help defend some of our own possessions for
                            instance. Aranha was so impressed with the point of view set out above
                            that he did not want to think about that yet.</p>
                        <p>I repeat that we will think about the matter further and talk it over
                            again in the next few days.</p>

                        <p>As you are aware we secured from the Brazilian military authorities in
                            writing an agreement for officers from our General Staff <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0513"/>to come here to talk over the whole
                            defense business with officers of the Brazilian General Staff (see my
                            telegram No. 665 of June 14, 4 p.m.<note n="23" xml:id="d507fn1">Not
                                printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>Our military authorities desire a previous Brazilian agreement to some
                            additional points before they come. The Brazilians will eventually agree
                            but this of course has put off the conversations. In my opinion this is
                            a mistake: Our officers should have come here as soon as the Brazilians
                            agreed to their coming. It would also be a mistake to insist on signing
                            any sort of a formal agreement in the premises at this juncture. It is
                            often possible to get more out of Brazilians without a signed agreement
                            than with one.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the last paragraph of my
                            telegram No. 751 of June 28, 6 p.m., I have the honor to report that the
                            War Department has set out another condition (a perfectly acceptable
                            condition, it is true) concerning the secrecy to be maintained; but,
                            having in mind the Brazilian methods, this will again slow up the
                            conclusion of the more or less formal agreement that the War Department
                            wants signed apparently before they send down staff officers to begin
                            conversations. All of this is a mistake: as I remarked before, the staff
                            officers should have been sent as soon as the Brazilians agreed to their
                            coming: if they had come at once it is possible that constructive
                            conversations would now be going on in regard to the defense measures to
                            be taken in the northeast. Our staff officers, if they win the
                            confidence of their Brazilian colleagues, can contribute considerably to
                            the end of our being eventually allowed to participate in a direct
                            fashion in the defense of that area.</p>
                        <p>As I have set out before, there is only one possible way to persuade the
                            Brazilian military authorities to allow us to send officers and troops
                            to the Natal area and that is under the guise of teaching them how to
                            use the arms we furnish them; possibly for instance a training center
                            might be set up near Natal with United States equipment, utilities,
                            training facilities, etc. Brazil could complete the division that it is
                            now building up in that area and could send there also some additional
                            special units. If we provided the equipment for a small air force, for
                            anti-aircraft units, for mechanized units, for anti-tank units, for
                            seacoast defenses and for mobile ground <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504"
                                facs="0514"/>troops, it is very possible that a suggestion that a
                            group of say one hundred officers and one thousand NCO’s to be sent
                            there for instruction purposes would be favorably received. I repeat we
                            would have to be prepared to furnish all the necessary equipment to
                            complete the armament of the division and special units with heavy
                            machine guns, as well as the necessary special weapons such as batteries
                            of 155 GPF coast defense guns, 37 m/m and 90 m/m (or 3") anti-aircraft
                            guns and motorized and armored equipment.</p>

                                    the rapidity with which the international situation is changing,
                                    I have felt that it might be helpful to us both if I addressed
                                    to you this personal message in order to let you know of my
                                    views with regard to the world situation and to inform you of
                                    some of the steps which this Government is taking in order to
                                    assure itself that it is not overlooking any practicable
                                    precaution which would insure the security and the defense of

                                    defend the integrity of that country. The British troops, which
                                    until now have taken part in the defense of Iceland, will
                                    eventually be replaced by American forces during the period of
                                    the next few months. Through the American defense of Iceland and

                                    attack against the Western Hemisphere. Were Germany suddenly to
                                    resort to these tactics, she would undoubtedly have needed to
                                    utilize Iceland in the North Atlantic and presumably Dakar and
                                    the Cape Verde Islands in the South Atlantic as naval and air
                                    bases, first of all to cut off all convoys <pb n="505"
                                        xml:id="pg_505" facs="0515"/>to the British Isles and,
                                    subsequently, as concentration points for actual attack against
                                    North and South America.</p>
                                <p>The possibility of a sudden German movement from the points I
                                    have named in the South Atlantic is still disquieting. As a
                                    partial measure to forestall such a movement, I have ordered
                                    considerable forces to the bases leased by the United States in
                                    Trinidad and in British Guiana. I think you will agree that
                                    should there later be signs that Germany is actually preparing
                                    to move to Morocco and West Africa, the forces sent by the
                                    United States to Trinidad and British Guiana would not be
                                    sufficiently close to the point of the Western Hemisphere which
                                    Germany would probably first attack, namely, Natal, in order to
                                    render speedy and immediate effective assistance to the
                                    Brazilian forces.</p>
                                <p>A careful survey of typical German action makes it probable that
                                    their blitzkrieg tactics would give to us in the Americas no
                                    breathing spell to prepare defenses in any given spot after the
                                    Germans had suddenly occupied West Africa and the Cape Verde
                                    Islands. For in such event Germany might well launch an air and
                                    sea attack against Natal almost immediately.</p>
                                <p>I have under consideration the possibility of negotiating with
                                    the Government of the Netherlands for the temporary use of air
                                    and sea patrol facilities at Surinam. In the event that such a
                                    negotiation were concluded, would your Government be willing to
                                    share in the utilization of such facilities with the United
                                    States by the stationing of Brazilian forces there as
                                    complementary to the United States forces as a measure of
                                    cooperation in the defense of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                                <p>Another strategic point which must remain in friendly hands if
                                    the security of the New World is to be safeguarded is the
                                    Azores. I have made it clear to the Portuguese Government that
                                    this Government desires only that the Azores and Cape Verde
                                    Islands remain under the unimpaired and sovereign jurisdiction
                                    of Portugal.<note n="27" xml:id="d509fn4">For correspondence

                                    In the event, however, of a German occupation of Portugal, it is
                                    highly probable that Germany would immediately attempt the
                                    occupation of the Cape Verde Islands and of the Azores. In the
                                    interest of the defense of the Western Hemisphere such
                                    occupation would have to be prevented by the United States. In
                                    such event I hope the Government of Portugal would request the
                                    United States or Brazil, or both, to assist Portugal in
                                    defending both the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. I would
                                    also welcome knowing from you whether, in such contingency, the
                                    Brazilian Government would be willing and prepared to share with
                                    the United States that further possible defense task.</p>
                                <p>The present hostilities between Germany and the Soviet Union have
                                    for the moment diverted the major portion of Germany’s attention
                                    from the west to her eastern frontier. It is impossible at this
                                    time to predict how long this situation may continue. It seems
                                    to me all the more desirable, therefore, by the friendly
                                    exchange of views which I am seeking by means of this personal
                                    message, to clarify the positions of our Governments with regard
                                    to these vitally important questions.</p>
                                <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0516"/>
                                <p>May I take this opportunity of expressing to you my deep
                                    appreciation of all the innumerable evidences of cooperation
                                    which the Brazilian Government has shown to the Government of
                                    the United States during these past months. The intimacy of the
                                    relations between our two countries and the friendship between
                                    the people of Brazil and of the United States are traditional
                                    and I feel that in recent times they have become closer and more
                                    understanding than ever. I shall await with great interest the
                                    views which you may feel free to express to me with regard to
                                    the problems mentioned in this message.</p>
                                <p>I am addressing you somewhat at length because I want you to
                                    share all my knowledge and all the possibilities I am compelled
                                    to prepare against. The gist of the matter is frankly this: <list>
                                        <item>First. If Germany should eliminate Russia in a few
                                            weeks, a very large amount of personnel and matériel
                                            would be released for use elsewhere.</item>
                                        <item>Second. In such event it could be used directly
                                            against the British Isles, or, should that seem to the
                                            Germans of doubtful outcome, the obvious alternative
                                            would be to try to close all access for shipping to
                                            Great Britain. The obvious places to cut off shipping
                                            would be the narrow portion of the South Atlantic and
                                            the northwest approaches to the British Isles. The
                                            success of such a move should be forestalled with plenty
                                            of preparation. Germany so far has succeeded through the
                                            use of surprise tactics and because of the shortness of
                                            time for preparation on the part of the countries she
                                            has attacked. Therefore, we feel that this summer, even
                                            before the Russian venture is settled, the Americas
                                            should take all preliminary precautionary steps.</item>

                        <p>954. For the Acting Secretary. Department’s telegram 525, July 10, 9 p.m.
                            President Vargas asks me to transmit to President Roosevelt his reply to
                            the message received from him: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    maintain direct contact and I thank you for your initiative in
                                    letting me know your ideas concerning the world situation, as

                                    the defense of our hemisphere. Your Excellency’s viewpoints
                                    entirely coincide with my own views on the subject. It is

                            and again assured me of Vargas’ cooperation; adding that he had a long

                            cooperating. He said, however, that Góes remarked again that the United
                            States seems anxious to get troops into northeastern Brazil but does not
                            seem anxious to help Brazil to defend that region. …</p>

                            although the Brazilians will invite us to send troops to northeastern
                            Brazil when the German menace really seems imminent to them; in the

                        <p>1127. In pursuance of the agreement concerning military cooperation
                            reached between the General Staffs of Brazil and the United States based
                            on a memorandum handed to the War Department by General Góes Monteiro
                            during his visit to the United States last year (see Department’s
                            instruction no. 1044, January 7), conversations were held at Rio by the
                            Joint United States-Brazil Planning Group. The Brazilian Chief of Staff
                            now recommends the immediate appointment of a permanent Joint Board for
                            Northeast Brazil to plan the construction of base facilities required
                            for hemisphere defense in Northeast Brazil. This planning work is
                            essential in order to determine the financial obligations which the
                            United States may incur in connection with this construction, as well as
                            the actual procurement of these funds.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department desires that a naval officer shall be a member of
                            this Board.</p>
                        <p>The War Department adds that in the opinion of General Miller each
                            government should be represented on the Board by one engineer, one air
                            force, and one naval officer and that Brazil should appoint an
                            additional member who will be President of the Board. After an initial
                            meeting at Rio, the Board would proceed to the Recife-Natal area to take
                            up its permanent station. It would operate under the <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0523"/>same general conditions as the Joint
                            Staff Planning Group except that with the approval of both countries,
                            its proceedings would remain secret, although the appointment of the
                            Board would be made public.</p>
                        <p>If you perceive no objection to this plan, you will please submit it to
                            the Brazilian authorities at the earliest possible opportunity with a
                            view to obtaining their approval in order that the War Department may
                            proceed with the necessary arrangements.</p>

                            will get the American planes. He insists that all German <pb n="516"
                                xml:id="pg_516" facs="0526"/>influence and control (other than above
                            mentioned remaining Axis employees) have now been eliminated (I believe
                            this is true).</p>
                        <p>I have had [information regarding?] Vasp personnel from 15 different
                            sources and I am in position to point out the objectionable individuals
                            in the company.</p>
                        <p>He reminded me that Vasp two pilots in Los Angeles [were] maintained
                            there at considerable expense to the company.</p>
                        <p>If the planes can be obtained at an early date they will remain there and
                            bring them back; if the planes cannot be furnished promptly he will
                            bring his pilots back to Brazil and find other means of bringing the
                            planes here as soon as they are available.</p>
                        <p>Vasp would very much like to acquire other American equipment but have
                            not the cash available.</p>
                        <p>I have in mind the Department’s telegram No. 5 of January 4, 8 p.m.,
                            following which the Brazilian Government was secretly informed that “in
                            return for the elimination of German influence and control this
                            Government would take the necessary steps to obtain prompt release of
                            equipment for Vasp et cetera” and adding “the lending agencies of this
                            Government would undertake such financing of the equipment et cetera”;
                            although I am not of the opinion that the amount [<hi rend="italic"

                            is a line Rio de Janeiro–Porto Alegre–Montevideo–Buenos Aires–Santiago.
                            The schedules awaiting approval connect with Lati<note n="51"

                            that he has no idea of making difficulties for our oil companies on this
                            but that he is extremely reluctant to do anything to interrupt the Lati
                            service: it is he says the only effective means aside from cable that he
                            has of communicating with many of his representatives in Europe and
                            North and West Africa.</p>

                        <p>197. Embassy’s 291, April 9. I understand the reason for hesitation is
                            the hope that perhaps further consideration of the matter will lead the
                            Brazilian Government to conclude that the disadvantages of continuing on
                            the present basis outweigh the advantages. I would not press Aranha on
                            this but the matter might be kept before him.</p>

                            is hoped that at least regarding mica and industrial diamonds, this

                        <p>202. Your despatch no. 4441, April 4. The Department considers that a
                            resumption of service of the Air France at the present time would be
                            highly undesirable.</p>
                        <p>In view of the strong possibility, almost certainty, that the United
                            States Government will soon be able to make equipment and financing
                            available for the establishment of a strong Brazilian airline or
                            airlines, it is hoped that you will consider it advisable to make our
                            feelings, concerning Air France, known to Aranha.</p>
                        <p>The Department expects to be able to telegraph you definite favorable
                            information concerning airplanes for Vasp within two or three days.</p>

                        <p>220. Two Lockheed Lodestars have been made available to Vasp for
                            immediate delivery. Two additional Lodestars have been allocated for
                            delivery to Vasp in the near future, probably within 3 months or less.
                            It is understood that Vasp has made its own financing arrangements for
                            the first two Lodestars. By the time the second two are needed it is
                            practically certain that financing for the second two on very favorable
                            terms and conditions will be available.</p>
                        <p>As a condition to supplying Vasp with airplanes, this Government desires
                            a commitment that Vasp agree to sell its present equipment to it or its
                            order. Under the financing plan now almost completed Vasp’s present
                            equipment would be acquired on a trade in basis at prices which will be
                            more than the prices the company would probably obtain in the market.
                            There is no objection to Vasp’s continuing to use its present equipment
                            subsequent to its acquisition of the first <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519"
                                facs="0529"/>Lodestars and prior to a reasonable time after the
                            acquisition of the final two.</p>
                        <p>The supply of the airplanes to Vasp is of course dependent on assurances
                            from you that effective degermanization will simultaneously be carried
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the president of Vasp of the foregoing. Within a few days
                            the Department will be able to notify Vasp’s representatives in the
                            United States where and when they can take delivery of the first two
                            Lodestars.</p>
                        <p>Information regarding exact delivery date of planes and details of
                            financing will be telegraphed later.</p>

                        <p>In other words, he has no more money.</p>
                        <p>He added that if our Government can help him with the financing, he is
                            perfectly ready to sell all of his present equipment to us on our order
                            which includes 5 planes all told including the 2 new ones and a lot of
                            recently arrived accessories from Germany.</p>
                        <p>He said moreover that he is prepared to de-Germanize completely the
                            company including personnel as far as we wish him to go. In that case he
                            must have permanent employment of American mechanics and two American
                            pilots temporarily to act as instructors during a brief training period.
                            (This obviously would contravene the present law against foreign pilots
                            on Brazilian planes, a law which we have frequently invoked against
                            Germans. Camargo Aranha said he could do nothing about that but hopes
                            that I could.)</p>
                        <p>He added that Vasp could run on their present German equipment for 2
                            years more but he insists he prefers throwing in the German equipment
                            and using American only.</p>

                            Brazilian Government’s permitting their serving as instructors during a
                            brief training period on the distinct understanding that their presence
                            in Brazil is for the purpose of familiarizing and training Brazilian
                            pilots in the operation of the new equipment. It is presumed that the
                            Brazilian Government has no objection to the temporary employment of
                            American mechanics. In this connection this Government will be pleased
                            to give advanced training in this country to Brazilian pilots.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the services of Thomas Hardin<note n="58"

                        <p>550. Your 823, July 10, 5 p.m. The Department has understood that,
                            although the setting up of a Brazilian national company was to be
                            explored by Burden and Russell to the extent that you deemed advisable,
                            Vasp was to be given primary consideration. Department has recently
                            obtained from R.F.C. the view that administratively it would be more
                            practical to deal with Vasp, Varig<note n="66" xml:id="d533fn1">Empresa
                                de Viacao Aerea Riograndense Varig.</note> and Condor as a single
                            transaction than to make piecemeal approach to the undertaking. Thus,
                            there would be one problem for decision and one general settlement to be
                            made. R.F.C. is very anxious to reach a satisfactory solution of the
                            matter since it feels that the entire situation in Brazil is much more
                            difficult than the one handled in Bolivia and that the success or
                            failure of the R.F.C. program will depend largely upon the course
                            pursued in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Department is impressed by the reasons given by the R.F.C. for wishing to
                            deal with the three companies as a single transaction, and it would
                            appear that this plan would tend to prevent a successful attempt by
                            opposing interests to interfere with the general program as might
                            conceivably result if each company should be dealt with separately.</p>
                        <p>To recapitulate, the viewpoint held here by R.F.C, as stated above,
                            strongly favors the nationalization of Vasp, Varig, and Condor in either
                            of the following ways: the first, by combining the three companies into
                            one strong national organization, and the second, by simultaneously and
                            separately reorganizing the three companies under bona fide Brazilian
                            auspices. It is felt by R.F.C. that under either or both of the plans
                            the stock could be so apportioned between the Brazilian Government and

                            be desirable.</p>
                        <p>The R.F.C. has indicated its willingness to provide such equipment,
                            finances and technical aid as would be necessary to establish a first

                            Vasp, I have the honor to report that Camargo Aranha came to see me this
                            morning and said that his resignation as well as that of the other
                            directors had been accepted by the new Interventor. He remarked that one
                            of their last acts had been to discharge Ludwig Weber, the last
                            remaining German of any importance in Vasp. There remain only a few more
                            or less German mechanics.</p>
                        <p>In other words, strange as it may seem, the degermanization of Vasp has
                            in fact been accomplished at no cost to us.</p>

                        <p>941. Negotiations between the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, other
                            interested agencies of the Government, and Pan American Airways have
                            reached a point where a definitive agreement between Pan American and
                            the RFC can be signed at any time providing for a once-a-week round-trip
                            service between New York, Belém, Natal, Portuguese West Africa, and
                            Lisbon, using large seaplanes of the type currently in the Atlantic
                            service. Before signing the agreement and inaugurating the service,
                            which will cost the United States Government several million dollars a
                            year and necessitate the reduction of important services elsewhere, it
                            is essential that Brazil agree to the elimination of Lati, to take
                            effect concurrently with or shortly after the establishment of the new
                            service. The sole reason for the establishment of the new service, is,
                            of course, the elimination of Lati. Within 60 days the service can be
                            started with one airplane and by the end of 90 days, possibly a little
                            bit sooner, with two airplanes. One airplane can provide a fortnightly
                            service and two airplanes a weekly service. The route from Brazil to
                            Europe will not pass through British territory (regularly at least) so
                            that the censorship question should not arise. Additional DC–3 service
                            will also be provided by Pan American Airways between Natal and Buenos
                            Aires in substitution for Lati’s routes between these points.</p>
                        <p>As the Department envisages the problem, two alternatives offer
                            themselves for the elimination of Lati. The first and preferable one of
                            course would be through positive action on the part of the Brazilian
                            Government cancelling Lati’s franchises, justifying itself on the basis
                            of Lati’s menace to hemisphere defense. The second one, appealing
                            perhaps more to the Brazilian Government but in the Department’s view of
                            possibly dubious efficacy, would be to dry up Lati’s fuel stocks; the
                            Department entertains serious anxiety with regard to the time element
                            involved. However the Department leaves to your judgment the approach to
                            use in broaching the subject with the Brazilian Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes once more to emphasize the importance which it and
                            the War and Navy Departments attach to the prompt elimination of Lati,
                            and it entertains the hope that with the offer of the new Pan American
                            Airways service you will succeed in obtaining the desired Brazilian
                            assurances to cancel Lati’s franchises.</p>

                            this telegram because I apprehend that the Brazilian authorities will be
                            unwilling to continue indefinitely to do everything we ask them to when
                            we may appear to be remiss on our side.” The bombers which we promised
                            (and then withdrew the promise) were not furnished to the Air Ministry.
                            On our side we have continued with new requests for favors which have at
                            times reached one favor a day. We have established what is in effect a
                            ferry service for planes to Africa over Northeast Brazil (three services
                            described in Radio Bulletin number 196). I arranged yesterday for a
                            flight of the first 3 “of another 45 or 50 United States Government
                            transports” as set out in Department’s telegram 735 of August 28, 8

                            says “eventually but not before January 1942 service number 1 may
                            include flying deliveries of military aircraft.” Brazil has continued to
                            reserve strategic materials for our use in spite of strong pressure from
                            Germany and Japan; Germany at one point even prevented Swedish vessels
                            from carrying Brazilian goods to Europe in reprisal. Brazil forced the
                            Argentine to establish an export control system to supplement ours.</p>

                        <p>The Minister for Air has recently referred to what he termed a shortage
                            of planes for Panair to Brazil in its present services. He will be
                            disposed to talk about the elimination of Condor when he is convinced
                            that substitute planes are actually on hand. He remarked that Condor is
                            the oldest airline in Brazil and has rendered excellent services to this
                            country; that furthermore, as it continues to render good and necessary
                            services he does not wish to eliminate it until a substitute has been
                            definitely provided for.</p>

                            reaches you it is expected that Lati will have been taken care of and
                            that there will be no objection to proceeding with Condor.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, the Defense Supplies Corporation has now delivered five
                            Lockheed Lodestars to Pan American in Rio. The sixth and seventh will
                            arrive within 10 days, possibly sooner. It is understood that Panair do
                                Brasil<note n="79" xml:id="d540fn1">Subsidiary Company of Pan

                            not entirely, duplicate Condor’s services in Brazil. Since Condor has
                            some gasoline remaining and since it will undoubtedly contrive to remain
                            in operation on a reduced schedule at least, after its stocks are
                            supposedly exhausted, you are requested to notify Standard of Brazil and
                            other possible United States suppliers to cease at once all deliveries
                            to Condor, unless you perceive compelling reasons to the contrary. On
                            receiving word from you, the Department will confirm to the New York
                            office of Standard Oil your instructions to the Standard of Brazil to
                            cease deliveries to Condor.</p>
                        <p>The War and Navy Departments attach the utmost importance to the
                            immediate elimination of Condor as well as Lati.</p>

                            making available to the Brazilian Government $100,000,000 of military
                            and naval material over the next 3 years or so. This program will be
                            carried out, in general, under the lend-lease arrangements, but, since
                            the organization for the lend-lease activities has not yet been
                            perfected, it is not possible at this time to provide the Brazilian
                            Government with full details regarding the terms and conditions which
                            will eventually be worked out.</p>
                        <p>On March 25 I explained this to the Brazilian Ambassador who appeared
                            gratified and to understand the situation. The Brazilian Ambassador
                            stated that General Amaro<note n="84" xml:id="d542fn2">Gen. Amaro Soares
                                Bittencourt, Brazilian Military Attaché in Washington, designated to
                                handle Brazilian requisitions for materials under Lend-Lease.</note>
                            was afraid that the terms proposed for the immediate credit of
                            $12,000,000 to be handled through the Export-Import Bank would apply to
                            the entire program, and I replied that there was no basis for this
                            belief, that the terms and <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0539"
                            />conditions of the remaining portion of the program would be the
                            subject of special consideration in view of all of the circumstances.
                            The Brazilian Ambassador also showed me a copy of a telegram from
                            President Vargas stating <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Brazilian Government is interested in securing through the

                        <p>The same afternoon the War Department handed to General Amaro a

                                    will be procurable within the next succeeding 2½ years, it must
                                    be understood that unpredictable events may make it necessary to

                                    quantities called for in the agreements with the buying agencies
                                    as it is not the intention to interfere with private purchases.
                                    Dollar exchange arising from such transactions will be
                                    considered outside this agreement.</item>

                                    should fall below the quantities contracted for, no penalty for

                        <p>Certain special provisions will have to be worked out with regard to
                            industrial diamonds, quartz crystals and mica as it is recognized that
                            the variety of grades and sizes of these commodities makes definite
                            agreement as to qualities, quantities or prices extremely difficult and
                            producers of these materials especially cannot predict or control the
                            types of material to be produced. Under these circumstances we suggest
                            that private concerns in the United States continue to purchase such
                            commodities freely on the same basis as heretofore except that the
                            sellers and purchasers shall be requested to provide the Brazilian
                            Government and the United States Government respectively with detailed
                            statements as to quantities and grades of material purchased and prices
                            paid. Any surpluses not so purchased which meet the specifications with
                            regard to quality established for the United States governmental
                            agencies will then be purchased by the latter. The prices to be paid by
                            United States governmental agencies c. i. f. United States Atlantic
                            ports shall be the average of the prices paid by the private concerns in
                            the preceding quarter for material of comparable grade.</p>
                        <p>Your reaction to this suggestion or alternative suggestions from you will
                            be appreciated. In connection with the above suggestion we point out
                            that it may be that a representative of the United States purchasing
                            agencies will be on the spot in Brazil to assist in working out this
                            entire arrangement for the purchase of commodities.</p>
                        <p>In the case of such materials as manganese, rubber, chromite, and others
                            in which neither the range of prices nor the diversity of grades is so
                            great, it should be possible to negotiate purchase agreements for a 2
                            year period on the basis of prices currently prevailing. In view of the
                            probable reluctance of the Brazilians to commit themselves for 2 years
                            at present prices the United States governmental buying agencies would
                            be willing to have a clause in the agreement providing <pb n="531"
                                xml:id="pg_531" facs="0541"/>for a review of the price situation at
                            6 months intervals and for a consideration of an increase in the price
                            in case of a rising market provided that there be a similar commitment
                            by the Brazilians to reduce prices in the event of a falling market.
                            Prices should be reviewed in the light of published quotations in
                            authoritative trade publications and in all cases should be stated in
                            United States currency based on market quotations in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>You have made recent estimates of the probable production of critical
                            materials during the years 1941–1942. It is suggested that these
                            estimates be used as a basis of figuring the probable quantities
                            involved. There may be of course other commodities than those contained
                            in your estimates which will be the subject of the buying agreement.</p>

                            me confidentially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. It is probable that within a few days the agreement will be
                                    signed between the authorized representatives of Brazil and the
                                    United States providing for the initial credit of $12,000,000
                                    for the procurement of munitions by the Brazilian Army. Half of
                                    this sum is intended for automotive and mechanized
                                    equipment.</p>
                                <p>2. It seems urgent that our Government take the necessary steps
                                    to insure that some deliveries of equipment be made to the
                                    Brazilian Army with the least practicable delay. For nearly 2
                                    years Brazilian Army authorities have been endeavoring to
                                    procure equipment in the United States ‘under as favorable terms
                                    as those given by [the Germans].’ To date no modern military
                                    equipment has been obtained from us except some searchlights
                                    purchased for cash from the Sperry Company.</p>
                                <p>The arrival in Brazil of modern equipment from the United States
                                    (such as tanks and armored cars) even if only in small
                                    quantities would produce a tremendous moral effect. In spite of
                                    my efforts to explain matters, there exists in the minds of many
                                    Brazilian Army officers a doubt as to the effectiveness of our
                                    assistance. The situation would become worse if a German ship
                                    should suddenly reach Brazil with a cargo of Krupp armament—an
                                    event which seems to be possible if not probable.</p>
                                <p>3. It is recommended that our Government make immediate delivery
                                    to the Brazilian Purchasing Mission in the United States of
                                    approximately <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0542"/>the
                                    following quantities of mechanized equipment: 25 tanks, light;
                                    10 tanks, medium; 25 scout cars.</p>
                                <p>These quantities were reported to the Brazilian Army as
                                    immediately procurable in February 1941. They are one-third of
                                    the total quantities of mechanized equipment desired by the
                                    Brazilian Army under the 6,000,000 dollars earmarked for that
                                    purpose.</p>
                                <p>4. The action recommended in the preceding paragraph would
                                    demonstrate our good intentions and would silence the pro-German
                                    propaganda to the effect that the United States will sell to
                                    Brazil only obsolete equipment. Furthermore, it would create a
                                    willingness to wait a reasonable time for additional
                                    deliveries.</p>
                                <p>5. Although the great majority of the Brazilian Army is decidedly
                                    pro-American probable additional victories of the German Army
                                    this year will strengthen professional admiration of that
                                    military machine, warranting energetic action on our part.

                            general licenses for the exportation to Brazil of a fairly extensive
                            list of articles and materials. It is anticipated that these general
                            licenses can be issued within the next few days, and you will be
                            notified immediately upon their issuance.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the Department is issuing licenses authorizing exports
                            to Brazil as freely as the requirements of our national defense will
                            permit. Applications have been dealt with in the most liberal possible

                            Embassy with which the Department is cooperating closely in regard to
                            this matter. Moreover, a number of unlimited licenses <pb n="533"

                            Brazil enjoys the advantages resulting from the issuance of general

                        <p>519. The Department on July 7 handed to the Brazilian Ambassador and
                            General Amaro copies of a draft basic agreement<note n="88"
                                xml:id="d546fn1"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_139"
                                    >p. 139</ref>.</note> for the lend-lease program of transferring
                            military matériel to Brazil. The principal financial provisions are as
                            follows: Brazil is to receive a total of $100,000,000 of war and navy
                            matériel of which it is expected $15,000,000 of army matériel and
                            $1,000,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the fiscal year
                            ending June 30, 1942. This delivery schedule is subject to change if
                            broad defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>Brazil is expected to repay $35,000,000 prior to June 30, 1947,
                            $15,000,000 during the first year, and $4,000,000 a year for 5 years
                            thereafter. In consideration of the broad objectives of the program and
                            of certain very general economic concepts, the entire obligation of
                            Brazil to the United States would be considered discharged by such
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has been informed that the $12,000,000 Export-Import Bank
                            credit is not to be considered in any way supplemental, but rather as a
                            line of credit to the Bank of Brazil for use if necessary in order to
                            meet the $15,000,000 payment for the first year. The Dept understands
                            that the Bank of Brazil informed Mr. Pierson during his recent visit to
                            Rio de Janeiro that it would probably not have to draw upon this credit
                            of $12,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was also informed that to permit a smooth functioning of
                            the purchasing machinery it would be essential that Brazil do as other
                            governments have done and establish a single individual or board to
                            coordinate and unify the activities of the several purchasing missions
                            in this country.</p>

                                xml:id="d547fn1">Neither printed.</note> The Department is today
                            sending you an air mail instruction transmitting a revised draft of the
                            Lend-Lease Contract<note n="89" xml:id="d547fn2">Neither printed.</note>
                            to be taken up with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The new draft is
                            completely reciprocal with respect to Articles VI and VII (text of July
                            11 instruction<note n="90" xml:id="d547fn3">Not printed.</note>),
                            modifies the second paragraph of Article III, and in several other ways
                            brings in the Government of Brazil and the President of Brazil. The
                            question of the word “fiscais” is one of the Portuguese translation, and
                            there would be no difficulty in changing it to “financeiros”.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the repayment the Department is agreeable to equal annual
                            amounts of $5,833,333.33 over 6 years. It would not be practicable to
                            extend the credit to 7 years. The original proposal was based on the
                            fact that the Export-Import Bank had extended to the Bank of Brazil a
                            credit of $12,000,000 to help in financing such arrangement. The Bank
                            and the Department believe that this credit may continue on the books of
                            the Bank, but that any utilization of this credit should be subject to
                            new discussion with the Export-Import Bank.</p>

                            Exports.”</p>
                        <p>Brazilian officials have determined that they are unwilling to enter into
                            definitive contract for sale of strategic materials in which prices are
                            fixed in fear that such action will be politically unpopular…On the
                            other hand they have consented to restrict exports of strategic <pb
                                n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0549"/>materials to the United States
                            which action they state can be explained on the ground that this is
                            being done in return for United States materials needed for domestic
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>They have now definitely agreed to an exchange of notes between the two
                            Governments reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. “The Brazilian Government undertakes for a period of 2 years through
                            the issuance of export licenses and other adequate control regulations
                            to restrict to the United States of America the exportation of strategic
                            materials that meet the specifications in exhibit A attached hereto.</p>
                        <p>2. The Government of the United States undertakes to continue to
                            facilitate as it is now doing, the shipment to Brazil of materials
                            essential to Brazilian industry, the exportation of which is dependent
                            upon Government permits and other formalities.</p>
                        <p>3. In case purchases by private American industries do not absorb all of
                            the merchandise covered by paragraph 1 above, Metals Reserve Company or
                            Rubber Reserve Company<note n="97" xml:id="d550fn4">These two
                                organizations were United States Government corporations operating
                                under the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as its purchasing
                                agents.</note> undertakes to acquire all of the surplus existing in
                            Brazil at prices to be agreed upon between these companies and Banco do
                            Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In determining prices consideration shall be given not only to world
                            quotations for these materials but also to their cost of production and
                            the price of American products covered by paragraph 2 above.”</p>
                        <p>Exhibit A referred to in paragraph 1 will contain a complete list of
                            materials in which we are interested together with appropriate
                            specifications.</p>
                        <p>We have explained to them carefully that we understand paragraph 2 to
                            mean that we will do everything consistent with our defense program to
                            facilitate shipments to Brazil and they have agreed to this, I intend to
                            write an accompanying note insisting on this.</p>
                        <p>The proposed arrangement appears to be favorable to our Government and
                            its approval is recommended.</p>
                        <p>If the proposal is approved the Brazilian Government expects the separate
                            Export-Import Bank credit for 12 million dollars already arranged for.
                            The Bank of Brazil says it will probably not need the credit but wants
                            it available at least until June 30, 1942.</p>
                        <p>Pierson<note n="98" xml:id="d550fn5">Warren Lee Pierson, president of the
                                Export-Import Bank.</note> approves the purchase part of the
                            proposal pointing out that it obligates Metals and Rubber Reserve
                            Company to buy only if prices are satisfactory. In this connection he
                            recommends that immediate credits be opened authorizing limited
                            purchases in Brazil at market prices of such materials as are urgently
                            needed in the United States. He is of the opinion that with the
                            exception of diamonds the shutting off of exports to Axis countries will
                            result in the purchase <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0550"/>by
                            private American firms of substantially all available Brazilian
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>I also approve the proposed exchange of notes in the foregoing terms.
                            However, I should like to have the Department’s approval of them before
                            signing. I assume that the Department can give its approval quickly
                            since authority to make the various commitments involved is implied
                            practically in full in the instructions cited at the beginning of this
                            telegram. I hope it will instruct me in the premises today or tomorrow
                            since Pierson must leave here early Thursday morning and Aranha<note

                            authorizes the signature of the notes in the form set forth in your no.
                            460 with the following understandings: <list>

                                <item>There should be added to paragraph 2 of the note quoted in

                                    be consistent with the carrying out of the defense program of
                                    the United States and its policy of assisting governments and
                                    peoples engaged in resisting aggression.” The Department will

                            <p>“I take pleasure in transmitting to you herewith my note No. 765
                                expressing my Government’s agreement to the terms of your similar
                                note regarding a program for facilitating the acquisition of
                                Brazilian exports of certain kinds of strategic materials and the
                                shipment to Brazil from the United States of certain materials
                                needed by Brazilian industry.</p>
                            <p>In transmitting this note No. 765 I wish to state clearly the
                                understanding of its paragraph No. 2 upon which agreement was
                                reached in the oral discussions of it by Your Excellency, the
                                Minister of Finance, Mr. Warren Lee Pierson, and myself. Stated
                                briefly this understanding is that paragraph No. 2 means that
                                shipments of the kind specified therein will be facilitated insofar
                                as may be consistent with the national defense program of the United
                                States. It is upon this understanding of paragraph No. 2 that my
                                note No. 765 is based.”</p>

                        <p>470. Department’s 294, May 14, 4 p.m. crossed my telegram No. 466, of May
                            [14] 8 p.m. which covered the matter.</p>
                        <p>Since the addition of other materials from time to time would have to be
                            agreed upon as they were added, a provision to that effect would be
                            superfluous in the present notes. Our discussions have all been based on
                            the expectation of further additions, however, and the Brazilian
                            authorities expect them.</p>
                        <p>Exhibit A covers bauxite, beryl, chromite, ferronickel, industrial
                            diamonds, manganese ore, mica, quartz crystals, rubber, titanium,
                            (rutile) and zirconium.</p>
                        <p>Private American purchases will probably take care of most of the ores
                            for the present, but the reserve companies should prepare shortly <pb

                            purchase in the Brazilian market and these buyers will call on you

                            is a unilateral commitment on the part of the Federal Loan Agency, the
                            purpose being to provide a floor for prices so that no criticism of the
                            Brazilian Government may occur as a result of the agreement which it has
                            signed with the Federal Loan Agency. There is no commitment on the part

                        <p>332. Referring to Department’s no. 325 of May 20. The Federal Loan Agency
                            is prepared, through Danforth, to make purchases, take delivery of and
                            pay for the quantities of materials at the prices indicated, but
                            believes that the Bank of Brazil or other agency to be set up by the
                            Brazilian Government must have the responsibility of all negotiations
                            with Brazilian producers or handlers for the acquisition of such
                            materials, the determination of quantities and qualities and the <pb
                                n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0554"/>prices to be paid such
                            producers or handlers, as well as the necessary steps to effect the
                            concentration of the same at some central point to be agreed upon for
                            delivery to Danforth.</p>
                        <p>Sales by Brazilian producers to private consumers in the United States
                            would continue to flow through the normal channels of trade at such
                            prices and at such amounts as they may mutually agree upon.</p>
                        <p>Presumably some agreement between the Bank of Brazil or the other
                            Brazilian Agency and the Federal Loan Agency going into the details will
                            have to be worked out by Danforth with the Embassy’s assistance and sent
                            to the Department for approval by the Federal Loan Agency here.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Loan Agency realizes that in many cases the prices quoted in
                            telegram no. 325 apply to certain specific grades. The Agency is willing
                            to buy materials of other grades at the discounts from or premiums above
                            the standard prices set forth in exhibit A prepared by Messrs. Wright
                            and Pierson in their negotiations in Rio.</p>
                        <p>Please advise as promptly as possible whether these proposals meet with
                            the approval of the Brazilian Government.</p>

                        <p>525. Department’s telegram No. 332, May 22, 7 p.m. I do not understand
                            precisely what is meant by the phrase “must guarantee the responsibility
                            of all negotiations”.</p>
                        <p>The Bank of Brazil is not yet in a position to buy or sell commodities
                            and it would be some time before it could create machinery for this. As
                            understood when the agreement took its final form and was signed, it
                            provides simply that the Metals and Rubber Reserve Companies will buy
                            (directly from the usual private sellers) materials available for
                            export. The Brazilian Government and the Bank of Brazil or their
                            agencies do not (and are not prepared to) enter into the buying except
                            that they will be glad to give our buying agencies without
                            responsibility such information and advice as they may have regarding
                            exporters, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Government has its regulations to prevent shipments of
                            strategic materials to countries other than the United States already
                            drafted, mimeographed and signed. But it will not issue them until our
                            agencies are ready to make immediate purchases as necessary and I so
                            inform it.</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0555"/>
                        <p>Our Government will certainly have to begin buying some of the products
                            in large quantities immediately when Brazil’s export restrictions are
                            placed in effect especially diamonds, quartz, mica and certain ores.</p>
                        <p>The Germans are now again buying heavily here to load Italian ships in
                            Brazilian ports especially since the announcement in Washington this
                            week that the Federal Loan Agency is “going to” buy large quantities of
                            Brazilian strategic materials. <hi rend="italic">The same day</hi> the
                            Germans are stopped from buying, Brazilian exporters will have to be
                            able to turn to some one in Brazil ready to buy for the United States at
                            the prices stated in the Department’s telegram No. 325, May 20, 6
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p>Has the Federal Loan Agency completed its organization mentioned in the
                            penultimate paragraph of the Department’s telegram No. 325? Can it give
                            the name and date of arrival of the representative mentioned in
                            paragraph No. 4 of the Department’s telegram No. 294, May 14, 4 p.m.?
                            Will it also have a diamond expert in Brazil offering to appraise and
                            act on industrial diamonds? Or is Danforth expected to arrange all this
                            and prepare to begin buying on behalf of the Metals and Rubber Reserve
                            Companies requesting the issuance of commercial letters of credit in
                            favor of specific sellers, arranging for the storage here of materials
                            lacking cargo space or unwanted in the United States at present,
                            appointing private traders as experts (the Government and Bank of Brazil
                            have none) to inspect and accept materials bought et cetera.</p>
                        <p>If so he suggests preliminary procedure as follows: That orders covering
                            available industrial diamonds be lodged with Harry Winston and Company
                            Incorporated New York; that orders covering available quartz crystals be
                            lodged with Western Electric or Electrical Research Products Company;
                            that subject to prior approval by Metals Reserve and prior discussion
                            with Watson an irrevocable letter of credit be opened in favor of Arthur
                            Watson and Company Limited, Rio, covering available mica. Danforth is
                            writing with reference to other products.</p>

                        <p>339. Your telegram no. 525 of May 23 has been discussed with the Federal
                            Loan Agency. The Agency had always understood from <pb n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546" facs="0556"/>the beginning of the negotiations that
                            the work of purchasing from the Brazilian producers and of assembling
                            and checking the various materials at concentration points, which
                            presumably would be Brazilian ports, be carried on by the Bank of Brazil
                            or other agency set up by the Brazilian Government. In fact the Federal
                            Loan Agency was advised of the appointment of Mr. Filho<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d557fn1">Francisco Alves dos Santos Filho, Exchange Director
                                of the Bank of Brazil.</note> to organize this department of the
                            bank of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Loan Agency is nevertheless willing to take over a large
                            share of this work. It now proposes to send Mr. Leonard J. Buck to Rio
                            de Janeiro. Mr. Buck will arrive there next Wednesday. His duties will
                            be to buy the materials listed in no. 325 at the prices therein
                            mentioned. He will buy only from the large wholesalers or exporters who
                            will make deliveries at concentration points, presumably Brazilian
                            ports. When the materials are ready for delivery, they will be received
                            and checked by Buck and Danforth. Arrangements have already been made
                            with the National City Bank to make payment against invoices and
                            documents approved by Buck and Danforth. Buck will hire such experts as
                            may be necessary to assist in all this work. This includes industrial
                            diamond experts and such other specialists as may be required.</p>
                        <p>Since Buck will arrive Wednesday, it is believed that all the necessary
                            arrangements can be made promptly upon his arrival to enable the
                            issuance by the Brazilian Government of the regulations prohibiting
                            exports except in accordance with the agreement. It seems therefore not
                            necessary to adopt any preliminary methods such as are suggested in your
                            telegram.</p>

                        <p>375. Reference Department’s 358 of June 2. The Brazilian rubber situation
                            was again discussed this morning with Goodyear officials in the light of
                            latest information available regarding current prices in Para and
                            current discussions taking place in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The elements of the problem would seem to be as follows: From the
                            Brazilian point of view, the desire of the producers and the Government
                            to secure a fair return for their rubber, and the further desire to
                            assure the continued operation of the manufacturing plants in Brazil;
                            from the American point of view, the desire to provide a reasonable
                            price for Brazilian rubber production not required in Brazil or any
                            other of the American republics, and a further desire identical with
                            that of Brazil to assure the continued operation of the manufacturing
                            plants in Brazil on the basis of using Brazilian rubber.</p>
                        <p>It appears to us that this problem could be handled to the greatest
                            mutual satisfaction on either one of the two following bases: First, the
                            Brazilian Government through the Bank of Brazil would arrange to procure
                            all Brazilian rubber production, and to make whatever quantity is
                            necessary available to the manufacturing plants in Brazil at a
                            reasonable price (adjusting the duty on manufactured products to
                            whatever extent might be necessary in the light of the price of crude
                            rubber that is determined), and to sell the rest at the price and
                            pursuant to the arrangement which Buck has brought with him. Second,
                            should the Brazilian authorities not be willing to carry out this
                            arrangement, a satisfactory alternative would appear to be (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) enforcement of export control by the Brazilian
                            Government; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) action by the Brazilian
                            Government to form a pool out of the Brazilian crude rubber production
                            in amounts necessary for the Brazilian manufacturers for resale to them
                            at a reasonable price (with any necessary duty adjustment as mentioned
                            above), accompanied by an agreement in the form and at the price which
                            Buck has brought with him to buy all other Brazilian rubber becoming
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Will you as promptly as possible discuss this with the Brazilian
                            authorities with a view toward effecting an immediate arrangement.</p>

                            p.m. and 1697, November 8, 8 p.m.<note n="7" xml:id="d560fn1">None
                                printed.</note> Department and Metals Reserve agree with the Embassy
                            that the purchase agreement should be extended to include cobalt,
                            tungsten, and nickel ore. You will be notified by telegram as soon as a
                            decision is reached concerning tantalite, columbite, and carbonados. It
                            is not likely that there will be any recommendation to purchase
                            aquamarines or other semi-precious stones.</p>
                        <p>The terms suggested for cobalt are a maximum of 300 tons of cobalt ore
                            per year of not less than 4 percent cobalt content at a price of 50
                            cents per pound of contained cobalt c.i.f. New York.</p>
                        <p>The terms proposed for tungsten are a maximum of 180 tons of tungsten
                            concentrates per year with WO<hi rend="sub">3</hi> content of 30 percent
                            or better. The price would be $21 per unit c.i.f. New York for
                            concentrates with WO<hi rend="sub">3</hi> content of 65%. A schedule of
                            grades, penalties, and bonuses similar to those in other Metals Reserve
                            contracts will be forwarded later.</p>
                        <p>In the case of nickel ore, a different procedure is suggested. The terms
                            of the agreement would be changed to substitute nickel for ferro-nickel,
                            which would bring all classes of nickel-bearing materials within the
                            scope of the agreement. The maximum quantity of contained nickel to be
                            purchased would be increased to 150 metric tons per year, and the price
                            would be based on the current domestic quotation of 29.5 cents per pound
                            for refined nickel f.o.b. New York, less transportation costs and
                            appropriate treatment charges for conversion into refined nickel.</p>
                        <p>When these three commodities are added to the purchase agreement they
                            will of course become subject to all its provisions, and as to them the
                            agreement will terminate on the same date on which it terminates as to
                            the other commodities. Revision of cobalt, tungsten, and nickel prices
                            will be considered every 6 months simultaneously with revision of the
                            prices of other materials, and the export of cobalt, tungsten, and
                            nickel from Brazil will be restricted exactly as the export of the other
                            strategic materials in the agreement is restricted.</p>
                        <p>The Department requests that with the aid of the Federal Loan Agency
                            representative you enter into negotiations with the Brazilian
                            authorities for the inclusion of these products in the agreement, and
                            telegraph the form of note that will be proposed to put the arrangement
                                <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0559"/>into effect. If the
                            Brazilian Government is willing to have these products added to the
                            agreement, it is important that they be placed under export control
                            immediately, so that there will be no opportunity for undesirable sales
                            contracts to be filed before the new export regulations become
                            effective. In this connection, you are requested to notify the
                            Department what contracts for the sale of cobalt, tungsten and nickel
                            are now recorded with the Bank of Brazil.</p>

                            National Defense program of the United States.”</p>
                        <p>The third paragraph will read the same subject to such maximum annual
                            quantitative undertakings for the three commodities as the Department
                            indicates should be included and using the term “purchasing agencies of

                            them assurances that we were prepared to make purchases.</p>
                        <p>I am giving Aranha a strictly confidential memorandum on castor beans and
                            castor oil inquiring whether his Government agrees in principle. I have
                            included the statements in the Department’s telegram under reference and
                            also requested that pending negotiations the registration of sales
                            contracts be suspended for shipments to unapproved destinations. The
                            Brazilian reaction to the proposal that direct shipments to the United
                            Kingdom be permitted is unpredictable. It will be recalled that Brazil
                            [made] protests to our basic agreement by stating that it was a <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> arrangement and not unneutral.</p>
                        <p>The proposals on cobalt, tungsten and nickel ore appear satisfactory and
                            I am prepared to negotiate this matter upon receipt of Department’s
                            approval of the proposed note outlined in my 1897, December 3, 6
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with Department’s suggestion I plan to qualify the
                            statements regarding quantitative limitations with the following:
                            “Should it appear that Brazil’s exportable surplus exceeds the
                            quantities under reference, the purchasing agencies of the United States
                            Government will make every effort to acquire the additional amounts
                            available.”</p>

                            Reserve approve all suggestions in your 1897, but an exhibit should be
                            attached to the notes containing the maximum quantities and perhaps also
                            the prices as set forth in Department’s 1141 of November 14 and 1260 of
                            December 4.<note n="11" xml:id="d563fn1">Latter not printed.</note></p>

                        <p>A question has been raised concerning last paragraph in your 1928.
                            Department and Metals Reserve agree that the form of commitment which
                            you propose is too broad. In this connection Department refers to
                            discussion in its 1260 of requirement that there be a definite maximum
                            limit to any obligation of Metals Reserve. In this case Metals Reserve
                            would prefer a simple option to acquire any available quantities of
                            cobalt, tungsten or nickel in excess of the maximum figures. If
                            Brazilian authorities will not accept this, will you then suggest a
                            possible increase in the maximum figures for cobalt and tungsten
                            sufficient to cover the anticipated excess production. Metals Reserve,
                            however, does not wish to increase its commitment as to nickel.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph any further suggestions.<note n="12" xml:id="d563fn2">On
                                January 12, 1942, the Embassy submitted drafts of a note, exhibit,

                                cobalt, tungsten, and nickel. The Department agreed to this with two

                                Minister, and General Staff representatives of both countries from
                                August 19 to September 3, 1940. On September 1, 1940, the Ambassador
                                sought Chile’s agreement on four points: (1) To increase
                                surveillance of dangerous elements for the purpose of detaining them
                                in case of emergency; (2) to continue the reciprocal exchange of
                                information on defense and subversive activities; (3) to make
                                preparation for the entry of United States forces by keeping open
                                the routes of entry, maintaining internal order, and making
                                facilities and supplies available; (4) to continue bilateral staff
                                conversations as needed. Chile conditioned its acceptance of these
                                points by offering to include United States experts in its
                                organizations for vigilance and control and thereby increase the
                                surveillance, and by requesting financial terms that would make
                                possible the purchase of armaments from the United States. (810.20

                            by the Chief of the Diplomatic Section of the Foreign Office, in which
                            it is stated that the proposed appointment of a United States Naval
                            Observer at Punta Arenas would not be acceptable to the Chilean
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>It may be explained that in the absence of Dr. Bianchi<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d566fn3">Manuel Bianchi, Chilean Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> at the time of the receipt of the Department’s
                            Telegram No. 26 of February 8, 1 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m., the
                            matter was taken up confidentially with the Chief of the Diplomatic
                            Section, who said he would obtain an informal expression of opinion from
                            the appropriate authorities. The statement contained in the Embassy’s
                            Telegram No. 61 of February 19, 6 p.m.,<note n="4" xml:id="d566fn4">Not
                                printed.</note> to the effect that there would be no objection to
                            the contemplated assignment, was conveyed orally by the Chief of the
                            Diplomatic Section, who stated that he had taken it up with the Ministry
                            of National Defense. Subsequently the Ministry of National Defense
                            decided it did not desire to have a Naval Observer assigned, as
                            indicated in the confidential Foreign Office memorandum transmitted
                            herewith.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion the Chilean Government may be in fact somewhat less
                            emphatic in its objections than the memorandum would imply, and if
                            sufficient information could be supplied to enable the presentation of a
                            clearer picture of the observer’s proposed activities, an assent might
                            be obtainable.</p>

                            to authorization received from the Department, the First Secretary was
                            absent from Santiago for several weeks on a trip through southern Chile
                            which included twelve days in the Punta Arenas area, and that he
                            returned to the capital on May 17. There are transmitted herewith three
                                memoranda<note n="7" xml:id="d567fn1">None printed.</note> prepared
                            by Mr. Briggs as follows:</p>
                        <p>1). Confidential memorandum discussing certain strategic considerations.
                            The Department will observe that Mr. Briggs recommends the maintenance
                            of our Consulate at Punta Arenas, and likewise urges that the transfer
                            of patrol vessels to Chile be expedited in order that an effective coast
                            guard service may be instituted by the Chilean Government in the region
                            of islands and channels along the coast of Chile for several hundred
                            miles north of the Pacific entrance to the Straits of Magellan.</p>
                        <p>This is the area concerning which apprehension exists relative to the
                            possible establishment of a secret foreign supply base, and both the

                            Chief of Staff of the Army, have expressed themselves to me on the
                            subject of the entirely inadequate surveillance at present possible. The
                            Department will also recall that on previous occasions I have urged that
                            action toward furnishing essential patrol craft be expedited.</p>
                        <p>2) Memorandum concerning present American representation at Punta Arenas.
                            The Department will be gratified to note the favorable opinion formed by
                            Mr. Briggs of the work of Vice Consul Barker at that post.</p>

                            the economic situation as affected by war conditions, et cetera. A copy
                            of this memorandum is being sent direct to our Embassy in Buenos Aires

                            delivered a speech which he promised me the day before would be “basic
                            and fundamental.” He said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“American solidarity is a combination of the moral, economic and
                                    physical forces of these countries to conserve intact, together
                                    with their own sovereignty, the beneficial democratic norms
                                    which rule us. The solidarity agreed upon only contemplates the
                                    employment of force for the common defense in case of
                                    extra-continental aggression. Chile is disposed to participate
                                    in the defense with serene and irrevocable decision.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This is the first strong public declaration from the Chilean Government
                            of agreement reached with us more than a year ago.</p>

                        <p>493. For the Under Secretary. Rossetti informed me this afternoon that
                            our request for permission for our war vessels to enter Chilean ports
                            without previous notice for refueling and supplies had been discussed
                            with the heads of the army and navy who are favorable but who ask that
                            our tankers transfer fuel to storage tanks in these ports and that our
                            vessels refuel from them rather than directly from our tankers. This to
                            prevent possible attacks from political opposition on charge ports being
                            used as naval bases. It is asked too that the agreement be made
                            bilateral, not that any Chilean ships will avail themselves of the
                            privilege to be extended our vessels, but also to meet political
                            criticism in the event the agreement becomes public. He wants the
                            agreement to be confidential between the two Governments. He will ask
                            the President for his approval tonight.</p>

                        <p>391. Your 493, October 2, 6 p.m. The text of the following proposed note
                            has received the approval of the Navy Department. If you perceive no
                            objection, you are authorized to deliver this note to the <pb n="557"
                                xml:id="pg_557" facs="0567"/>Chilean Foreign Office and request a
                            written reply transmitting the Chilean Government’s acceptance of the
                            contemplated arrangement.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Excellency: I have the honor to inform you that I am in receipt of
                                instructions from my Government stating that the Navy Department of
                                the United States, owing to the presence of raiders in the Pacific
                                Ocean, has expressed the opinion that it is urgently necessary to
                                increase its patrol activities in that ocean. In order to carry out
                                these duties effectively, the assistance of Your Excellency’s
                                Government is requested in order that blanket permission may be
                                granted to vessels of the United States Navy engaged in these patrol
                                activities to enter the ports of Antofagasta and Valparaiso for the
                                purpose of obtaining fuel and supplies. The commanders of these
                                vessels would inform the consuls at Valparaiso and Antofagasta as
                                far in advance of their arrival as possible for communication to the
                                appropriate Chilean officials.</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of the naval authorities of the United States, in
                                the event that this permission is obtained, to purchase fuel from
                                local sources whenever a sufficient supply is available. It may,
                                however, be necessary to transport oil in tank steamers to
                                Antofagasta and Valparaiso. In such instances, it is hoped that Your
                                Excellency’s Government will grant such fuel free entry and
                                exemption from payment of charges other than a reasonable fee to the
                                distributing agencies for storage and handling charges. It is also
                                requested that the Navy Department of the United States may be
                                permitted to arrange with the local distributing agencies to provide
                                from existing storage sufficient space for 5,000 barrels at
                                Valparaiso and 5,000 at Antofagasta into which the tankers may
                                discharge their cargoes.</p>
                            <p>It is hoped that Your Excellency’s Government will, in the interest
                                of Hemisphere defense, be good enough to accord favorable
                                consideration to the request of the United States Naval authorities.
                                My Government will be glad to grant reciprocal facilities to vessels
                                of the Chilean Navy which might desire to utilize for similar
                                purposes such ports on the Pacific coast of the United States as the
                                naval officials of Your Excellency’s Government might
                                designate.”</p>

                            receipt of Your Excellency’s note 697 of the 20th instant, by means of
                            which and in <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0568"/>fulfillment of
                            instructions from your Government you request that general authorization
                            be granted to the ships of the United States Navy who are engaged in
                            patrol activities to enter the ports of Antofagasta and Valparaiso for
                            the purpose of obtaining fuel and supplies. The commanders of these
                            ships would notify the Consuls at Valparaiso and Antofagasta concerning
                            their arrival as far in advance as possible, in order that this might be
                            communicated to the appropriate Chilean officials.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency adds that in the event that this authorization is
                            obtained, the Naval authorities of the United States have the intention
                            of purchasing fuel in the local market, as long as there may be a
                            sufficient quantity available, but as it may be necessary to transport
                            fuel oil in tank steamers to Antofagasta and Valparaiso, it is desired
                            that the Chilean Government exempt this merchandise from customs duties
                            and other charges, not including the reasonable expenses incurred by the
                            distributing companies in connection with storage and
                            transportation.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the note of Your Excellency requests that permission be
                            granted to the Navy Department of the United States to reach a suitable
                            understanding with the local distributing companies in order that the
                            latter may provide sufficient space to store 5000 barrels at Valparaiso
                            and 5000 at Antofagasta, into which the tank steamers may discharge
                            their cargoes.</p>
                        <p>As the purpose of the foregoing is to control the activity of certain
                            raiders in the Pacific Ocean, Your Excellency’s Government entertains
                            the hope that favorable consideration will be granted to this request in
                            the interest of Hemisphere defense.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Your Excellency states that the Government of the United States
                            will have the greatest satisfaction to grant reciprocal facilities to
                            the ships of the Chilean Navy, which may desire to use for similar
                            purposes such ports on the Pacific coast of the United States as the
                            competent Chilean Naval authorities may designate.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I am pleased to express to Your Excellency that the Government
                            of Chile, in order to give evidence of its spirit of continental
                            solidarity in the defense of our Hemisphere, and with a desire of
                            showing once more the spirit of collaboration with which it is inspired
                            in regard to the United States, accepts, on the basis of the
                            abovementioned reciprocity, the proposal that the ships of the American
                            Navy enter the ports of Antofagasta and Valparaiso, provided that
                            previous notification is given by the respective consuls to the
                            appropriate Chilean authorities.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Chile cannot of its own accord free from customs duties
                            the fuel and other articles which will be imported into the country for
                            the purpose of supplying these ships, in as much as this <pb n="559"
                                xml:id="pg_559" facs="0569"/>would require legislative action which
                            would mean a long delay and be accompanied by many difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government is disposed to grant all facilities compatible
                            with existing legislation and to permit that sufficient space will be
                            provided at the aforementioned harbors to store the necessary fuel.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the latter subject, the Chilean Government would desire
                            to obtain from the Government of the United States the assurance that
                            the stock of fuel thus established could be used to meet the national
                            necessities in urgent cases provided appropriate payment is made in
                            cash, or the fuel thus utilized is replaced after the conditions which
                            have impelled such action have disappeared.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Government of Chile will not be obliged to pay for the
                            installations or improvements which may be established at the ports of
                            Antofagasta and Valparaiso. These would be permitted to remain for the
                            benefit of the local population as soon as the facilities now granted
                            have terminated through becoming unnecessary.</p>

                        <p>678. For the Under Secretary. Referring to my 670, December 2, 5
                                p.m.<note n="15" xml:id="d574fn1">Not printed.</note> In condensed
                            form memorandum received from the Foreign Minister sets forth that in
                            accord with inter-American agreements of Panama and Habana the Chilean
                            Government thinks it urgent to fortify Straits of Magellan and maintain
                            in those waters a number of naval elements for the vigilance and
                            protection of that strategic zone. This in accordance with Chile’s
                            responsibility in the collective defense and because the present menace
                            to the peace of the Pacific makes it necessary to take measures to
                            prevent that route being employed against the vital interests of the
                            continent. It then quotes article 5 of the treaty of July 1881<note

                            neutralization of this region. It goes on to say the obligation falls on
                            Chile because it is sovereign on both coasts and the waters of the
                            Straits to take the initiative in conversations with Argentina to make
                            possible the fortification necessary during the period the security of
                            America is in danger. It says that negotiations promise a speedy
                            successful termination in view of assurances of Argentine Chancery to
                            Chilean Ambassador today. In view of expected successful <pb n="560"

                        <p>727. For Secretary, Under Secretary and President. Have seen Rossetti
                            second time today. He has finally forced ratification of agreements of
                            Lima, Panama and Habana. Has fought through Council of Ministers
                            declaration of Chile’s position on the war. Has taken steps for
                            protection of our property against sabotage. Has put Chile definitely in
                            our orbit and is pledged to Aranha to put Chile with Brazil and the
                            United States, this activity on his part has concentrated against him
                            all our enemies in Congress and outside, and in the Council yesterday he
                            was attacked on the ground that he has not been able to solve economic
                            problems with us. Pedregal<note n="19" xml:id="d575fn1">Guillermo del
                                Pedregal, Chilean Minister of Finance.</note> attacked us on copper.
                            Minister of Agriculture because we have not sent steel wire which is
                            primary necessity. Rossetti got his way by threatening to resign and the
                            Vice President supported him and he won.</p>
                        <p>I am positive Rossetti supporting us fully and against opposition far
                            more powerful than any Aranha can encounter. Discussed matters with my
                            staff, and found general agreement and in view of the pressing and
                            paramount importance of the war and our need of Chile now, I make the
                            following recommendations.</p>
                        <p>1. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) That we yield to Chile’s proposition on
                            copper rather than endanger our position on the supreme issue over a
                            quarter of a cent per pound.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) That we discuss with the National City Bank a
                            possible reconsideration of its rigid position on the loan matter, since
                            part payment <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0571"/>in pesos under
                            certain conditions was not thought impossible by the bank here.</p>
                        <p>I personally, as you know, have fought for the copper people and the bank
                            but now that an issue has been forced upon us which involves our
                            interests in the war I feel that the situation has changed. I believe
                            that we cannot let Rossetti down in view of the kind of enemies who are
                            after him.</p>
                        <p>2. There is a general alarm here, shared by Rossetti, that Chile may be
                            attacked from the sea. Rossetti has ordered the patrol of the coast,
                            preparation for the calling of naval reserves, and a substantial
                            increase in the number. General Escudero is organizing for the
                            protection of our mines. But Rossetti feels very strongly that there
                            should be an understanding between the two General Staffs to the end
                            that Chile may not be entirely in the dark as to what she can expect
                            from us if attacked. He is convinced that Japanese ships are off
                            Chanaral and Tocopilla in the region of the mines.</p>
                        <p>Rossetti says the attitude of the Japanese Minister is insolent and
                            sarcastic and demanding and cold and Rossetti shares the belief that
                            Chile is very likely to be attacked probably because of supporting
                            forces for Japanese in Chile. He feels Chile would be the center of
                            Japanese fire for all the continent.</p>
                        <p>3. In Congress where he has thus far won every fight with part of the
                            Rights and Nazis he has been asked if he has any direct assurance that
                            the United States would go to support of Chile if attacked and he has
                            nothing to sustain him beyond assurances by word of mouth. This has made
                            his position so weak that he admits having said this week that he had
                            direct assurances. He feels that he should have something in writing not
                            for publication but for use in secret session in case of necessity. I
                            personally feel he is entitled to it.</p>
                        <p>To sum up my conclusion is this: <list>

                        <p>305. Raúl Simón, manager of Grace<note n="22" xml:id="d576fn1">Pan
                                American-Grace Airways, Inc.</note> in Chile, has informed me that
                            the German Condor Air Line is attempting to obtain authority for a
                            service between Santiago and Arica and that he felt that extension of
                            such authorization by the Chilean Government a serious threat. While my
                            Military Attaché is inclined to discount this possibility (lack of
                            German flying equipment) and even to consider that Simón’s approach to
                            me may not be unconnected with Panagra<note n="22" xml:id="d576fn2">Pan

                            schedule is entirely inadequate and scarcely better than once a week
                            since there is a 5-day gap in the twice a week service. When Harris<note

                            admitted that Panagra should have a three times a week service between
                            Santiago and Arica and that unless they did the Germans would capitalize
                            the present opportunity.…</p>
                        <p>In any case, however, I desire to emphasize that in my opinion the
                            present Panagra service between here and Arica is altogether

                        <p>4. Your 305, December 15, 11 p.m. The Department has discussed the
                            subject of your telegram under reference with Roig and Harris of
                            Panagra. They say that at present Panagra does not have the equipment or
                            personnel available to operate an additional service between Arica and
                            Santiago, especially in view of the recent loss of an airplane in
                            Ecuador and the partial destruction of another in Buenos Aires. The
                            Department, as well as Panagra, is aware of the deficiency of the
                            present schedules, and will support an application <pb n="563"
                                xml:id="pg_563" facs="0573"/>by Panagra for additional equipment and
                            personnel for this service, as well as a mail subsidy from the Post
                            Office Department. The demand, however, for equipment and personnel is
                            so great that the Department must restrict carefully its support of
                            applications to the Priorities Board for equipment and indicate relative
                            preferences. At the present time it is considered that the most urgent
                            cases are in Ecuador and Brazil where the release of equipment will be
                            predicated on the actual removal of present German influence.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department advised of the possibility of the Chilean
                            Government granting any German airline the right to fly between Santiago
                            and Arica, in order that the situation in Chile may be weighed in the
                            light of conditions elsewhere and the limited equipment available.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information. Since the American Export Airlines has
                            been certificated by the Civil Aeronautics Board as an additional United
                            States international carrier, it is felt that the possibility for
                            expansion by this company as well as by Pan American and Panagra in the
                            American republics should be taken into consideration.</p>

                        <p>17. Department’s No. 4, January 6, 8 p.m. According to Simón, no German
                            proposal for a service between Santiago and Arica has yet been made in
                            writing. However, both he and Shannon<note n="24" xml:id="d578fn1">Of
                                Pan American-Grace Airways.</note> (manager from Lima who also
                            participated in our discussion) share the Embassy’s opinion that so long
                            as the part of the Panagra schedule is so inadequate the Germans have a
                            ready-made opportunity here. [Here follow suggestions as to details of
                            supplying service.]</p>
                        <p>Recent rumors which have reached the Embassy of attempted sabotage in
                            Peru (tampering with fuel supply) were discussed with particular
                            reference to the situation in Chile. The Panagra representative
                            professed to be fully alive to this danger and to be taking measures (of
                            the adequacy of which my Military Attaché is not, however,
                            convinced).</p>
                        <p>With reference to the general problem, I surmise that one reason for the
                            apparent lack of interest previously displayed by the company in the
                            Santiago-Arica service is its exclusion from cabotage <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0574"/>rights on that relatively long run
                            which probably limits its immediate profit possibilities. In my opinion
                            the best long term arrangement would be some tie-up between Panagra (or
                            perhaps Export Air Lines) and Linea Aerea Nacional which would provide
                            for the development on a cooperative basis not only of service between
                            Santiago and the north but also between Santiago and the populous area
                            of Chile south of the capital.…However, I am by no means convinced that
                            given a favorable American proposition and the proper negotiators,
                            coupled with appropriate support by our Government, it would not be
                            feasible for an American company to enter into some cooperative
                            arrangement analogous for example to that in Colombia.<note n="27"

                                for the new service, and that so far as he can judge the Company is
                                fully satisfied.”</note></p>

                        <p>223. The Department has heard that the Condor Syndicate, a German-owned
                            aviation organization, is said to be negotiating an arrangement with the
                            Chilean Government for a service twice a week between Santiago and
                            Buenos Aires.<note n="33" xml:id="d581fn1">In reply to this telegram the
                                Ambassador in Chile reported in despatch No. 1694, July 24, that the
                                Condor Syndicate was giving service weekly on this route and that it
                                was not apparent that it would be required under its concession to
                                negotiate for the twice-a-week service which it had scheduled
                                (825.79635/12).</note> According to press reports this morning,
                            Peter Paul von Bauer, formerly connected with the Scadta Company in

                            aviation services. The Department believes that the existence of these
                            services is inimical to the peace and security of the continent.</p>

                        <p>332. Department has now received assurances from Panagra that it will be
                            prepared to establish additional service between Santiago and Buenos
                            Aires about October 8. The Post Office Department and this Department
                            are interested in this matter because of the hope that with the
                            establishment of additional air transport facilities by Panagra the
                            operation of the Condor line to Chile might be eliminated. In the
                            circumstances the Department would appreciate having an expression of
                            your views as soon as possible whether it might not be appropriately
                            suggested to the Chilean Government that if it is willing to terminate
                            the Condor operation it will be supplanted by an additional service by
                            Panagra.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the foregoing Panagra officials have advised the
                            Department informally that they have been approached by an official of
                            the Chilean Air Transport Company on the question whether Panagra would
                            be interested in arriving at an understanding whereby Panagra might
                            avail itself of cabotage privileges. It is suggested that you discreetly
                            discuss this point with the local Panagra representative and advise the
                            Department whether you feel that this matter should be linked with the
                            establishment by Panagra of an additional service between Santiago and
                            Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p>472. Department’s 332, September 21, 2 p.m. According to Raúl Simón,
                            general manager in Chile of Grace and Company, Panagra has no intention
                            of establishing a permanent additional service with <pb n="567"
                                xml:id="pg_567" facs="0577"/>Buenos Aires unless or until the Condor
                            service is eliminated. It is doubtful that the mere establishment of
                            such service by Panagra would affect Condor operations, which naturally
                            will benefit by the summer boom. The additional service which Panagra
                            will furnish from October would appear to be the customary seasonal
                            extension of service to take care of summer tourist traffic from
                            Argentina. It is to be noted that at the present time because of
                            increased traffic, Panagra has been operating 4 flights a week to Buenos
                            Aires as compared with 3 to the United States by the West Coast.</p>
                        <p>Simón is of the opinion that the Chilean Government has no legal grounds
                            at present on which to break its contract with Condor which does not
                            expire until December 31, 1942. He remarked however, that possibly Chile
                            might find means to do so if instances like the reported arrest of nine
                            Chileans in Germany should continue. He further remarked that grounds
                            for breaking the Condor contract were available shortly after the start
                            of the war when Condor failed to maintain scheduled services but the
                            Chilean Government raised no objection at the time and full service has
                            been since restored.</p>
                        <p>Simón says that he has been engaged for some time in intermittent
                            negotiations with the Chilean authorities in an endeavor to establish in
                            principle the right of Panagra to carry on cabotage now forbidden by
                            law. Actually at the present Panagra is not much interested in cabotage
                            business which would interfere with its international traffic. These
                            negotiations were initiated by Panagra, not by the national company, and
                            have not been concerned with the matter of additional trans-Andean
                            service.…</p>
                        <p>It being improbable that the main object of eliminating Condor would be
                            furthered by the establishment of the proposed additional service on a
                            permanent basis, and there being no apparent connection between this
                            question and the delicate cabotage matter, I believe with the Department
                            that the latter should be left for separate and private treatment
                            between the companies.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the last paragraph of the Department’s telegram, the
                            Embassy understands that Montecinos is in the United States representing
                            Chilean air clubs and is interested in some such number of planes
                            similar to the Piper Cub class for civilian use. Chilean air clubs are
                            officially sanctioned and supervised, their head being a Chilean Air
                            Force officer, and benefit from certain special taxes but cannot be said
                            to be an official entity.…With further reference to the Condor Line I
                            assume that the Department is aware that it is ostensibly a Brazilian
                            corporation. That its only source of aviation gasoline in Chile is from
                            the Standard Oil subsidiary here and that is not on the Proclaimed
                            List.</p>

                            Santiago.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the institution of additional services by Panagra was
                            commercially feasible as well as necessary to carry forward the program
                            for the elimination of Condor. Mr. Roig indicated that the pilot
                            situation had eased somewhat and that he felt some confidence that
                            planes could be obtained. Mr. Mumper indicated that if it was absolutely
                            necessary, DSC would help out with a DC–3 although he would prefer not
                            to do so if any other course was open. If DSC is to furnish a plane, it
                            cannot do so before January 1.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Roig is to advise the Department by telephone when Panagra would be
                            prepared to institute additional services. It was made clear that the
                            matter of timing in this program was of the essence and that
                            consultation between Panagra and the Department would be necessary.</p>

                            Department and of this Department in the office of Mr. Purdum<note

                                General.</note> on October 30, 1941, concerning the air transport
                            services conducted by the Condor air line, under Axis control, between
                            Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Condor line now operates two services a week between Santiago and
                            Buenos Aires, and Pan American Grace Airways operates five services a
                            week between these places, making a total of seven frequencies. Pan
                            American Grace Airways has indicated a willingness to increase its
                            services from five to seven, thus providing a daily service, <pb n="569"
                                xml:id="pg_569" facs="0579"/>and it is expected that with this
                            increase arrangements can be brought about which will result in the
                            elimination of the Condor service.</p>
                        <p>This Department feels that the proposed increase of services by Pan
                            American Grace Airways is highly desirable from the standpoint of
                            foreign policy and hemispheric defense and strongly recommends that the
                            Post Office Department, so far as its jurisdiction is concerned,
                            cooperate in every way possible with the view to facilitating the plans
                            of Pan American Grace Airways to inaugurate the proposed daily service
                            between Buenos Aires and Santiago.<note n="38" xml:id="d585fn2">The Pan
                                American-Grace Airways company agreed to provide the increased
                                service if certain conditions were met, the first of which was that
                                the Post Office Department increase its subsidy to the company
                                corresponding to the additional mileage involved.</note></p>
                        <p>With the active cooperation of your Department and of other interested
                            agencies of this Government as well as the governments of the other
                            American Republics concerned, the removal of Axis influence or control
                            over air transportation has now been completed in all of the West coast
                            countries of South America. The elimination of the important Condor
                            service between Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile, will be an
                            important step toward the complete elimination of Axis influence or
                            control over aviation in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

                            their principals to completely cut off Condor’s gasoline supply. As
                            Panagra is now operating a daily Santiago–Buenos Aires service it would
                            appear desirable that Condor be forced to suspend operations upon
                            exhaustion of its present stock of fuel. I understand this stock here is
                            approximately 2200 litres. Therefore, I would suggest that the
                            Department immediately direct me or West India’s principals in the
                            United States to instruct West India here to deliver no more gasoline to
                            Condor. Unless so instructed West India probably will deliver 2000
                            litres to Condor on Saturday in accordance with its present instructions
                            to hold deliveries down to approximately a week’s supply.</p>

                                Finance in June.</note> during his recent visit to Washington and is
                            based on the same list of materiel which Pedregal altered and reduced.
                            It is not limited to anti-aircraft and coast defense equipment and
                            includes matériel valued at about 5 million dollars which Mr. Pedregal
                            was informed could probably be obtained this year if orders were placed
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that a portion of the funds recently voted by Congress

                            supply armaments to the American republics, although the technical
                            details by which this would be accomplished have not yet been
                            elaborated.</p>
                        <p>Although it is the considered policy of this Government to accord
                            priority to the needs of Great Britain you may rest assured that every
                            effort will be made to furnish Chile with the necessary military and
                            naval equipment in accordance with the above-mentioned plan.</p>
                        <p>The War Department would much appreciate it if the Chilean Government
                            would designate a representative in the United States with whom it could
                            discuss these subjects. The resumption of staff conversations in Chile
                            is discretionary with you.</p>

                            President has expressed his approval of the report on Chile’s request
                            for armaments prepared by the Joint Advisory Board on the American
                            Republics and has accepted a recommendation made by the Secretaries of
                            State, War and Navy that the provisions of the Lease-Lend Act be made
                            applicable when necessary to supply war material in the amount
                            stipulated by the Joint Advisory Board to such countries as may require
                            this assistance. The Chilean Ambassador has been informed of the
                            foregoing and has been requested to ask his Government to send technical
                            experts to Washington who will negotiate with the appropriate officials
                            of the Army and Navy for the delivery of the materials covered by the

                        <p>202. The Department on July 9 handed to the Chilean Ambassador a draft of

                            military matériel to Chile. The principal financial provisions are as
                            follows: Chile is to receive a total of $50,000,000 of war and navy
                            matériel of which it is expected $15,000,000 of army matériel and
                            $1,000,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the fiscal year
                            ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to change if broad
                            defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Chile is expected to pay $2,500,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $15,000,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the <pb

                            be accorded Chile, and indicated that he would at once transmit the

                            things outstanding concerning which piecemeal it has not been possible
                            to get a very positive picture, I asked Rossetti,<note n="50"

                            for a general survey. After lunch I told them the purpose of the
                            meeting, asked them to forget diplomacy and protocol and to speak out
                            frankly, as I would, to the end that we may all know precisely where we
                            stand. They expressed themselves as pleased.</p>
                        <p>1) I brought up the matter of the Defense Loan and expressed surprise
                            that so much time had expired since our proposition was made without a
                            definite answer, especially in view of the insistence of Escudero<note

                            that the gift of $35,000,000 had convinced some sceptics in the Senate
                            that there must be a trick somewhere, but that the defense of the
                            continent was of interest to us and that our contribution is not just to
                            Chile but to the common cause of defense. Rossetti admitted that there
                            were some sceptics in the Senate. He said that two days before our
                            Government had made a new proposition which Michels<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d592fn6">Rodolfo Michels, Chilean Ambassador to the United

                            proposition I could say nothing. He implied that his plan is to so word
                            the proposition that on the face of it, it would appear that the value
                            of the fifty million in material is but fifteen million.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Chile called at his request. He reminded me that, as he
                            had told me before, he had received from the Lease-Lend organization a
                            notice that he should prepare and submit to that Department his list of
                            requests for military materials within thirty days from the date of the

                            desired as soon as possible and, if possible, this week, to reach an
                            agreement on a final draft of the lease-lend agreement. He handed me an

                                said that he wished this because it would raise suspicions in the

                                value than the dollar payments which it was to make, there was some
                                other and undisclosed consideration. It would be agreeable to him to
                                have Article I provide that the United States proposed to transfer
                                to Chile under the terms of this agreement armaments and munitions
                                of war in accordance with the lists to be attached to this agreement
                                from time to time. The lists could then be attached after the
                                signing of the agreement as they were prepared, and there would be
                                an exchange of letters between the Ambassador and the Secretary
                                stating that the lists to be prepared would amount to a total value
                                of about the amount which had already been mentioned. I told him
                                that I would have to confer with other officers about this matter,
                                but that I thought that a solution could be reached along these
                                lines.</item>

                            <item>In Article V he wished to have eliminated the words, “without the
                                consent of the President of the United States of America”, and the
                                similar phrase in the second paragraph. The result of this would be
                                to put a complete prohibition upon the transfer of title to the
                                armaments and munitions which either country might transfer to the
                                other. I told him that I saw no serious difficulty about this
                                request, since it was simply waiving a right which the statute
                                permitted to be given to Chile.</item>

                            <item>He referred to Article IV of the draft agreement, which refers to
                                the circumstances under which Chile agrees to make defense articles
                                available to the United States, and requested that the obligation be
                                to <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0585"/>make such articles

                                terms to be agreed upon. I told him that the suggestion which he
                                made was in accordance with my understanding of the provisions of
                                Article IV.</item>

                            <item>He then referred to Article VI, the patent protection article,
                                which he did not understand, and said that his Government had asked
                                him to inquire what action was contemplated by the Article and how
                                the amounts which Chile agrees to pay were to be determined and in
                                accordance with what provisions of law. After some discussion, he
                                agreed that the provision would be more satisfactory to Chile if it
                                provided that Chile agreed to take action and indemnify citizens of
                                the United States for patent claims in accordance with the laws of
                                the United States, including Section 7 of the Lease-Lend Act, the
                                provisions of which Chile expressly accepted, with similar
                                provisions for the United States, omitting, of course, reference to
                                the Lease-Lend Act.<note n="58" xml:id="d593fn3">This matter was

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Acheson</hi>: Thank you for your letter of
                            October 9, 1941, in which you refer to my memorandum to you of September
                            29, 1941<note n="59" xml:id="d595fn1">Neither printed.</note> regarding
                            the proposed Lend-Lease agreement with Chile.</p>
                        <p>The terms of the agreement, including Article VI, as it is now drafted,
                            are quite satisfactory with us, as is your proposed letter to the
                            Chilean Ambassador. Article VI is written in the language of Section 7
                            of the Lend-Lease Act and there is therefore no possibility of an
                            inconsistency between the Article and Section 7.</p>
                        <p>As now drafted, Article VI of the proposed Chilean agreement contains a
                            reciprocity clause. It is our feeling that, if possible, the patent
                            clause in Lend-Lease agreements should contain only those provisions
                            required by Section 7, and that it would be desirable to eliminate the
                            reciprocity provision. However, if any foreign government insists on the
                            presence of such a provision, we will not oppose its inclusion.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the patent problems raised by Section 7 are now being
                            studied by the Department of Justice. In the course of that study the
                            questions posed by you in sections 3(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to 3(<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) of your letter will be examined. I therefore
                            suggest that we hold in abeyance all Lend-Lease patent problems and
                            re-examine them after the Department of Justice has completed its
                            current study.</p>

                            States in the interest of hemisphere defense to furnish the Government

                        <p>The Congress of the United States enacted on October 28, 1941 the Defense

                            $150,000,000 have been set aside for the acquisition of military and
                            naval equipment by the other American republics.</p>
                        <p>The budgetary limitations, however, require that the funds in question
                            shall be obligated not later than February 28, 1942. In consequence of
                            this, it would be appreciated if Your Excellency’s Embassy, provided it
                            has not done so already, would be good enough to present to the

                            receipt, with best thanks, of Your Excellency’s communication of
                            December 9, 1941, in which my attention was drawn to the offer made by
                            the Government of the United States in the interest of hemisphere
                            defense to furnish the Government of Chile with armament valued at
                            $50,000,000 under the terms of the Lease-Lend Act of March 11, 1941. It
                            was duly noted that the budgetary limitations required that the funds
                            shall be obligated not later than February 28, 1942, and as a
                            consequence Your Excellency suggested that the official lists of the
                            desired equipment be presented to the appropriate authorities of the
                            Government of the United States at the earliest possible date in order
                            that steps might be taken toward the procurement of the material.</p>
                        <p>I beg leave to bring to Your Excellency’s notice that I am now in receipt
                            of proper instructions which will enable me to proceed with the matter,
                            and every effort will be made on my part to satisfy the budgetary
                            limitation requiring the funds to be obligated before February 28,

                                xml:id="d598fn1">Not printed.</note> will be enacted in the near
                            future, the Metals Reserve Company<note n="63" xml:id="d598fn2">A
                                purchasing agency of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
                                operating under the Federal Loan Agency.</note> has formulated an
                            offer to acquire all of the exportable surplus of Chilean copper ores
                            and concentrates (excluding copper in the form of metal all of which is
                            handled by American companies), manganese, mercury, antimony,
                            molybdenum, lead concentrates, and cobalt except that portion of these
                            products which is sold to private interests in the United States or to
                            other Latin American republics which have established systems of export
                            control paralleling the export control system of the United States. The
                            form of the Metals Reserve offer (except as hereafter specified with
                            respect to cobalt) would be to purchase a certain specified amount of
                            each of the aforementioned materials which amount would be slightly in
                            excess of the Chilean production of these materials. The offer would
                            thus be in substance to acquire the entire Chilean production of each
                            material. Any amounts purchased by the private trade in the United
                            States would be credited against this obligation of the Metals Reserve
                            Company, The agreement would be for 1 year with a clause stating that it
                            is the intention of the parties to negotiate at the end of the year with
                            a view to the renewal of the agreement for a further period of 1 year.
                            The prices would be negotiated in detail once the principle of the
                            agreement were accepted by the Chilean authorities. During the life of
                            the agreement, the export of the products subject to the agreement would
                            be prohibited except to the United States and to other American
                            republics having export control systems parallel to that of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In view of shipping difficulties, it may be that the copper ores and
                            concentrates will have to be stockpiled in Chile at least for some time.
                            It is believed that shipping space can be provided for the manganese,
                            antimony, mercury, molybdenum and lead concentrates.</p>
                        <p>It is understood from your despatch no. 1543 of June 7<note n="62"
                                xml:id="d598fn3">Not printed.</note> that no cobalt will be produced
                            during the forthcoming year but that it would be desirable that Metals
                            Reserve offer to assist in providing a competent engineer to be placed
                            in charge of production and, if such <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579"
                                facs="0589"/>engineer so recommends, to provide some financial
                            assistance to accelerate the improvement program. Metals Reserve Company
                            is disposed in principle to assist in this way provided that the Chilean
                            Government will impose an export embargo on cobalt for a period of 3
                            years, thus in effect nullifying the purchase option which was referred
                            to in the Embassy’s despatch. The financial assistance might take the
                            form of an advance payment on the entire production for a period of 18
                            months after the mine comes into substantial production, which event
                            will take place, it is understood, in about 18 months from the present
                            date.</p>
                        <p>Mercury could be handled in the same way as manganese and the other
                            metals first mentioned, the only difference being that the price would
                            presumably be negotiated by Metals Reserve directly with the Compania
                            Minera Punitaqui instead of with the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss this offer of the Metals Reserve Company
                            with the Chilean authorities and to telegraph the Department whether the
                            proposal of Metals Reserve Company is acceptable in principle. If it is,
                            Metals Reserve Company is willing to designate a representative to act
                            on its behalf in assisting you with the negotiations as soon as the
                            legislation has been enacted authorizing export control.</p>

                        <p>288. At the close of last week Finance Minister Pedregal extra officially
                            informed representatives of the Embassy that an increasingly delicate
                            financial situation and a prospective decline in customs revenue soon
                            would require the Government to take definite steps to raise more income
                            and obtain additional foreign exchange. He stated that official opinion
                            in this connection was that a new arrangement would have to be made with
                            respect to copper and consideration was being given to three proposals:
                            namely, <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                    submitted to the Foreign Office a formal offer to purchase
                                    100,000 tons of electrolytic copper at 14 cents per pound free
                                    alongside Chilean ports; payments to be made in the United
                                    States dollars and the buyer to provide shipping space.<note

                        <p>Pedregal confided that he was not in sympathy with any of these proposals
                            but as some action was inevitable he favored an arrangement which would
                            be acceptable to his Government, the United States Government and at the
                            same time would leave Chilean copper in position to compete in world
                            markets after the conclusion of the war. He therefore had in mind the
                            negotiation of a 2-year agreement between the Government of Chile and
                            the United States giving the latter an exclusive monopoly of all Chilean
                            copper, including concentrates and ores, which it would purchase for
                            resale in the United States and all other markets. In return therefor
                            the Chilean Government would be designated the exclusive purchasing
                            agent of the United States and receive for its services a fee of one to
                            two cents a pound over prevailing prices for Chilean ports; the fee to
                            be paid in dollars and the United States to provide shipping space. The
                            agreement, it was intimated, also should contain a provision requiring
                            the copper companies to establish in Chile a plant for the primary
                            fabrication of copper products (bars, rods, sheets, plate wire, et
                            cetera) to relieve Chile’s dependence on foreign markets for these

                        <p>Turning to the question of iron and steel Pedregal stated that he
                            proposed discussing an arrangement with Bethlehem Company which annually
                            exports some 1,600,000 tons of high grade Chilean ore whereby that
                            concern would supply Chile using its vessels which presently are
                            arriving empty, with certain quantities of basic steel products (plates,
                            sheets, bars, et cetera) of which he asserted there is an acute
                            shortage.</p>
                        <p>Pedregal conveyed the impression that political elements were determined
                            to agitate the question of Chile taking advantage of the world copper
                            situation and that he is sincerely desirous of working out a plan which
                            is sensible, not too drastic, not burdensome to copper companies, but
                            which at the same time will satisfy the politicians, make available all
                            the copper to the United States for defense and other purposes, and will
                            give to Chile the additional revenue she requires.</p>
                        <p>Pedregal declared that his object in informing the Embassy was to
                            acquaint it with the trend of official opinion with respect to copper
                            and to obtain from the Department its reaction to his proposal which
                            might <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0591"/>serve as the basis of an
                            agreement to be negotiated giving the United States a monopoly of all
                            Chilean copper.</p>
                        <p>Pending receipt from the Department of comment on Pedregal’s proposal I
                            am holding in abeyance any action on Department’s telegram 175, June 28,
                            8 p.m., regarding the offer of Metals Reserve Company.</p>

                        <p>188. Your 288, June 30. The following is our provisional judgment after
                            talking with Federal Loan Administrator.</p>
                        <p>The ideas which you report as under consideration by Finance Minister
                            Pedregal appear to us undesirable. We realize the interest of the
                            Chilean Government in securing, in all reasonable measure, revenues from
                            the Chilean copper production during this period. These revenues have
                            already been benefited by the fact that we are now affording Chile a
                            reliable market for all its copper. The amounts currently being
                            purchased are very substantial, and it is our understanding that, in
                            addition to the amounts contracted for by the Metals Reserve Company,
                            there will be prospectively available between now and the end of the
                            year approximately 175,000 tons produced by the Anaconda and Kennecott
                            companies, all of which the Metals Reserve Company is prepared to buy.
                            The Metals Reserve Company is now in active discussion with
                            representatives of the Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies and
                            bearing in mind the Chilean interest is offering a price increase for
                            the 175,000 tons to which reference has just been made.</p>
                        <p>It is to be anticipated that the copper companies will be discussing the
                            whole situation with the Chilean Government and our hope is that out of
                            the conversations, on the one hand with Metals Reserve Company and on
                            the other hand with the Chilean Government, an arrangement that will be
                            satisfactory to the Chileans will result.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the matter of iron and steel, you may assure Pedregal that
                            this Government will do everything possible consistent with its urgent
                            needs for national defense to make available the iron and steel
                            production needed by Chile for important national purposes, and will
                            promptly consider, in detail, any request brought before it by the
                            Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>Our judgment is that it might be of use to have you proceed with the
                            proposal contained in our 175 of June 28 regarding copper
                            concentrates.</p>

                        <p>233. Reference Department’s 188 of July 4 and previous. The Department is
                            informed that because of the lack of shipping to transport copper
                            concentrates and ores from Chile to the United States certain American
                            companies are about to disband their organizations in Chile for the
                            purchase of these concentrates and ores. This necessarily increases the
                            amount of these materials available for disposition to undesirable
                            destinations. Accordingly, and despite the pendency of the problems
                            which are referred to in the Department’s 188 of July 4 and the
                            Embassy’s 288 of June 30, it seems desirable to press urgently for the
                            acceptance of the proposal set forth in the Department’s 175 of June 28
                            whereunder Metals Reserve would buy the exportable surpluses of Chilean
                            copper concentrates and ores, cobalt, molybdenum, mercury, lead
                            concentrates, manganese and antimony. Therefore, unless it is your
                            belief that the prospect of reaching an agreement with the Chilean
                            authorities is most unlikely, the Metals Reserve Company proposes to
                            instruct Graham<note n="69" xml:id="d601fn1">H. R. Graham,
                                representative of the Metals Reserve Company in Chile.</note> (see
                            Department’s 169 of June 25<note n="70" xml:id="d601fn2">Not
                                printed.</note>) or his assistant Miller to communicate with you at
                            once for the purpose of carrying out negotiations in collaboration with
                            you for an overall agreement along the lines set out in the Department’s
                            175. Will you telegraph the Department if this proposal meets with your
                            approval?</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy has advised the Department that the British
                            Government proposes to offer to purchase the entire exportable surplus
                            of wool in Chile. The British Embassy has suggested that it might be
                            desirable to present the two buying programs simultaneously, with the
                            possible effect of their reinforcing each other. You are requested to
                            consult with your British colleague and to coordinate the two offers in
                            so far as may seem desirable.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the Department is now discussing as a matter of
                            urgency, an improvement in the price paid for Chilean refined
                            copper.</p>

                                    exportable production of Chile’s ores and concentrates of

                        <p>In view of this acceptance in principle and as I believe there is
                            reasonable prospect of concluding contracts at this time for the
                            purchase of the exportable production of some, particularly copper ores
                            and concentrates and manganese, if not all the several classes of
                            minerals produced in Chile, I approve the Metals Reserve Corporation
                            immediately instructing its representative to communicate with the
                            Embassy for the purpose of carrying out negotiations as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Once purchase contracts have been concluded for any class or classes of
                            mineral products, Chile may be expected to restrict their export only to
                            the United States and those other American Republics having systems of
                            export control. It is unlikely that Chile can be prevailed on to impose
                            export restrictions prior to the conclusion of such contracts.</p>
                        <p>I am of the opinion that the Government will not insist too strongly on
                            the Paipote smelter proposition were it to endanger reaching an
                            agreement and I believe the desired financial aid can be limited to
                            facilities—credits or possibly advance payments against future
                            production—for the development only of manganese properties.</p>

                            with the proposed purchase of certain Chilean concentrates and ores by
                            the Metals Reserve Company that Mr. Thomas J. Williams, mentioned in the
                            Department’s <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0595"/>Telegram No. 249
                            of August 7, 6 p.m.,<note n="74" xml:id="d603fn1">Not printed; Mr.
                                Williams was a representative of the Metals Reserve Co.</note>
                            arrived in Santiago on August 18. He immediately called at the Embassy
                            and on the following morning was introduced to Mr. R. P. Miller, the
                            Metals Reserve Company’s special representative in Chile and the special
                            representative in this country of the Federal Loan Agency, to serve in
                            the absence of Mr. Horace Graham.</p>
                        <p>After Messrs. Williams and Miller had conferred with me regarding the
                            general aspects of the plan of the Metals Reserve Company and had
                            studied, in conjunction with my Commercial Attaché, all the detailed
                            information on the subject in the Embassy’s possession, I presented them
                            at 1 p.m. Friday, August 22, to Foreign Minister Rossetti. At the same
                            time I handed him my Note No. 603, of which a copy is enclosed,<note
                                n="75" xml:id="d603fn2">Not printed.</note> advising that the Metals
                            Reserve Company now was ready to discuss the acquisition of the
                            exportable surpluses of certain Chilean concentrates and ores and that
                            the special representative of the Company, Mr. Miller, was authorized to
                            negotiate a purchase agreement in collaboration with the Embassy. Mr.
                            Miller also handed the Foreign Minister a letter in the same tenor. A
                            copy of Mr. Miller’s letter is also enclosed.<note n="75"
                                xml:id="d603fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Williams outlined the essential points of the Metals Reserve
                            Company’s plan to Rossetti who immediately endorsed it and expressed the
                            hope that there would be no delay in reaching an agreement to which end
                            he promised his complete cooperation. The Foreign Minister declared that
                            it was his desire to go along in every way with the United States in
                            promoting hemispheric solidarity but difficulties were being experienced
                            in Congress where the opposition was charging the Government with
                            neglecting the national interest. The prompt conclusion of a
                            satisfactory purchase agreement with Metals Reserve, he said, would
                            greatly strengthen his and the Government’s position in Congress and
                            would facilitate obtaining favorable consideration of other important
                            measures involving continental defense and economic cooperation. He
                            explained that the United States had not received the measure of credit,
                            to which it was entitled, for the aid it already had extended Chile
                            largely because such aid had benefited the “vociferous little fellows”
                            only in an indirect way. An agreement with the Metals Reserve Company,
                            he declared, would drive home the fact that the United States was
                            interested in their welfare and was genuinely desirous of helping
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>As proof of his wish to go ahead at once with negotiations, Rossetti
                            appointed a committee composed of the President of the Miners’ Bank, the
                            Subsecretary of Commerce, the Vice President of the Fomento Corporation,
                            the Vice President of the Mining Society and a <pb n="586"

                            Fomento to meet with Messrs. Williams and Miller at six p.m. Friday
                            afternoon. The meeting, presided over by Rossetti himself, was carried
                            on in an atmosphere of mutual frankness and cordiality according to the
                            special representatives of the Metals Reserve Company. At the express
                            suggestion of the Foreign Minister, who declared that he did not wish to
                            give the meeting too much of an official character, no representative of
                            the Embassy attended. However, a report of the meeting is contained in
                            the enclosed copy of Mr. Miller’s letter No. 2 to the Vice President of

                            While it is too early to venture an opinion as to the ultimate outcome
                            of the negotiations I believe, with Mr. Miller, that to obtain an

                        <p>Refusal to make concessions along these lines might jeopardize the
                            negotiations which, if they are not carried to a successful conclusion,
                            could have unfortunate political repercussions here and lead to the
                            questioning of the sincerity of the whole good neighbor policy.</p>
                        <p>To surround the negotiations with as favorable an atmosphere as possible,
                            Rossetti tendered a luncheon on Saturday, August 23, to Messrs. Williams
                            and Miller, there being present on the occasion the members of the
                            Chilean Commission, influential members of Congress and individuals
                            prominent in the mining industry. Both the meeting with the Commission
                            on Friday and the luncheon the following day were given wide publicity
                            in the local papers. The principal press articles, clippings of which
                            are enclosed, were inspired by the Foreign Minister who was quoted by
                            the <hi rend="italic">Diario Ilustrado</hi> as having said: “it is the
                            firm purpose of the Government to obtain, by all the means at its
                            command, the stability and prosperity of the small mining industry,
                            assuring it prices which will permit the development of its maximum
                            productive capacity.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. Williams returned to Buenos Aires yesterday, leaving Mr. Miller to
                            continue with the negotiations in collaboration with the Embassy. His
                            presence here was most helpful in starting the negotiations. Both he and
                            Mr. Miller made an excellent impression on all with whom they came in
                            contact and it is my observation that the Metals Reserve Company has in
                            these men two very capable and competent representatives.</p>

                                    and informed them while failing to inform the Minister. Rossetti
                                    seemed greatly interested.</item>

                                <item>Copper export tax. He insisted there is no cause for worry. He
                                    recalled his statement to me previously, as reported, that
                                    Government cannot prevent Congress from initiating such
                                    measures, and that Government cannot oppose such measures openly
                                    when thus initiated because of public opinion.…He said that
                                    there are two propositions pending, one to devote proceeds of
                                    this tax to armaments and the other to housing and public works.
                                    His plan is for Government to propose or sponsor a measure
                                    devoting tax to public works since this will lead to prolonged
                                    Congressional discussions and Congress adjourns on September 18,
                                    only to reassemble on the call of the President. Before it
                                    reassembles he hopes some plan as to copper can be worked out by
                                    the two Governments. Says that copper tax proposal dangerous as
                                    for many years Chileans have looked to such taxes on nitrate,
                                    etc., to evade the necessity of imposing domestic taxes.</item>

                        <p>292. The Under Secretary discussed current phases of relations between
                            Chile and the United States with the Chilean Ambassador yesterday, with
                            particular reference to the copper situation and the electric company
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles pointed out that the price to be paid for Chilean copper by
                            the Metals Reserve Company had formed the subject of lengthy and
                            exhaustive discussions over a period of weeks and that on August 23 a
                            solution was reached which seemed acceptable to the Chilean Ambassador
                            and the basis of which was the abandonment by the Chilean Government of
                            current proposals for an export tax on copper. Mr. Welles said that he
                            had learned with great surprise that, on August 26, the Chilean
                            Government had presented to the Congress an export tax proposal. He
                            referred generally in this connection to the considerations which have
                            already been made known to you.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles also discussed with the Ambassador the electric power company
                            matter. He stated that of course the question of Government ownership or
                            operation is one which only the Chilean Government can determine, but
                            that the fundamental fact with which the two Governments are currently
                            faced is that Chile is in no position to offer adequate compensation for
                            the properties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles concluded that this Government has gone out of its way to
                            cooperate with the Chilean Government in every way and that it is
                            therefore particularly unfortunate for this Government to be confronted
                            with the steps which the Chilean Government apparently contemplates
                            taking against the legitimate interests of United States investors in
                            Chile. Mr. Welles said that, even the knowledge that such steps are
                            being contemplated has a tendency to destroy confidence in Chile and
                            Chilean credit and naturally to dampen the desire of this Government to
                            continue cooperating with Chile, to say nothing of the adverse effect
                            upon any possible flow of private capital.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss these matters yourself with the Foreign Minister at once
                            along the same lines, and make it clear that continued cooperation
                            between Chile and the United States must necessarily be bilateral and
                            not unilateral.</p>

                        <p>422. Reference my despatch No. 1779, August 25. The Chilean Commission
                            appointed by Rossetti has submitted to Miller an informal unsigned
                            memorandum outlining its views regarding the basis for an over-all
                            agreement with Metals Reserve. According to the Commission the agreement
                            should: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Cover all minerals produced including gold ore and
                                    concentrates, and any probable increases over previous
                                    production of manganese, zinc, cobalt and mercury.</item>

                                <item>That prices should not be less than those ruling in the market
                                    and should be established for production placed Chilean ports
                                    with payments 90% against delivery.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That the length of the agreement should be for not less than 3
                                    years.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>That long term loans should be made available for the
                                    development of new production of copper and manganese.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>

                                <item>That Chile be able to count on obtaining steel, repair parts
                                    and other materials essential to the mining industry.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Our reaction is that any agreement with Metals Reserve should be
                            conditioned on a satisfactory solution of the copper tax problem but if
                            it is believed desirable that we proceed with negotiations then it would
                            be helpful to receive from Metals Reserve final prices for all mineral
                            products including antimony and zinc, also authority to discuss an
                            agreement up to 18 months if necessary but refusing any commitments with
                            respect to points 4, 5 and 6.</p>

                            purchase gold ores and concentrates but in view of the strong
                            recommendation on this subject made by Miller in his letter to Bridgman
                            dated August 23,<note n="80" xml:id="d607fn1">Not printed.</note> Metals
                            Reserve without making any <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0600"
                            />commitment at the moment is studying the problem with a view to
                            finding some solution which will be satisfactory to the Chileans. In
                            your conversations with the Chilean authorities, you are requested not
                            to make any commitment on behalf of Metals Reserve with respect to gold
                            ores and concentrates but at the same time not to close the door to the
                            possibility of a solution satisfactory to Chile.</p>
                        <p>Metals Reserve does not understand your reference to “all materials
                            produced.” If there are any minerals not presently the subject of
                            discussion, please specify what they are.</p>
                        <p>With respect to increases over the previous production, Metals Reserve
                            will buy maximum amounts for each material in each year up to 125% of
                            the exports of the material in question for the preceding year.</p>
                        <p>2. Metals Reserve agrees that prices shall be established f. o. b.
                            Chilean ports; 80% payable upon delivery at port and an additional 10%
                            if cargo is not moved within 4 months, the balance payable upon receipt
                            of final analysis and assay.</p>
                        <p>3. Metals Reserve is willing to have the agreement for 18 months and no
                            longer, prices to be reviewed at end each 6 months period.</p>
                        <p>4. The Department and the interested agencies are unwilling to accept the
                            proposal concerning credits for new copper and manganese projects. If
                            there are any copper deposits of excellent quality which could be
                            brought into production immediately, the development of such properties
                            might be desirable. But it is felt that the loans, aggregating
                            $22,000,000, already authorized to Fomento by the Export-Import Bank are
                            sufficient to provide funds for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>5 and 6. The policy of this Government with respect to these questions
                            has been recently officially stated by the Under Secretary of State in
                            an address<note n="81" xml:id="d607fn2">Department of State <hi
                                    rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 30, 1941, p. 163.</note> on
                            the occasion of the anniversary of the declaration of Uruguayan
                            independence on August 25, 1941 as quoted in Radio Bulletin 202 of
                            August 25.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that this official declaration should reassure the Chilean
                            Government that every effort will be made to assist the Chilean economy
                            in so far as this may be done without seriously impairing the national
                            defense effort.</p>
                        <p>In order further to reassure Chilean authorities, the Department is now
                            considering a proposal to assign an officer to the Embassy in Santiago
                            for the purpose of consulting with the Chilean authorities on their
                            needs and of conveying to the Department for action here recommendations
                            for the granting of export licenses on products urgently needed. With
                            specific reference to the Paipote smelter materials, the Department is
                            sympathetic with the Chilean desire and wishes that you assure the
                            Foreign Minister that any charges that <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591"
                                facs="0601"/>the Department has been influenced by American smelters
                            to block the Paipote project are unwarranted. However, you should
                            impress it upon the Chilean authorities that the Paipote materials will
                            have to be considered in connection with the entire allocation subject
                            and must necessarily be subject to prior needs of national defense.</p>
                        <p>The Department and Metals Reserve desire that you continue the
                            negotiations for an overall purchase agreement but it is thought that
                            you could seize this occasion without establishing it as a condition
                            precedent to impress upon the Chileans that this Government earnestly
                            hopes that the copper tax matter may be out of the way before the
                            agreement is signed.</p>

                        <p>407. This Government is desirous of increasing its copper supplies. The
                            Anaconda Company has informed the Federal Loan Agency that with a new
                            capital expenditure of about $5,000,000 it can within a relatively brief
                            period increase its production at the Chuquicamata mine about 25,000
                            tons annually. This would be of genuine importance in our defense
                            program.</p>
                        <p>However, before the Anaconda Company can undertake this new investment,
                            it seeks assurance, and it seems to the Department to be justified in
                            its wish, as regards the tax treatment of the American copper companies
                            in Chile. This makes it desirable that this outstanding question is
                            settled as soon as feasible and on terms that are not excessive.</p>
                        <p>Second, the Anaconda Company believes that after the war emergency it
                            will have no market for the increased production resulting from the new
                            investment. It compares this new investment with that which many
                            companies are undertaking in the United States to increase production
                            for emergency defense purposes. It therefore requests the Chilean
                            Government to consider according to it on this new investment the same
                            treatment accorded by American tax laws, to wit, the privilege to
                            amortize it at the rate of 20 percent a year. This also seems to the
                            Department a reasonable request.</p>
                        <p>Would you please discuss this matter at once with the Chilean Government
                            with a view towards clearing a way for this new investment and of
                            getting a prompt and satisfactory settlement of the tax question which
                            is creating prolonged uncertainty.</p>
                        <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>Contemporaneously, the Department is urging upon the Federal Loan Agency
                            an increase in the price they are paying for all the copper that they
                            may buy from Chilean production to 11¾ cents f.a.s. New York (which is
                            the equivalent of the present United States price of 12 cents per pound
                            Connecticut River Valley delivery). There is a good chance that the
                            Federal Loan Agency can be persuaded to make this price increase at the
                            same time these other matters are settled. This would of course bring
                            further increases in Chilean tax revenues.</p>

                                xml:id="d609fn1">Latter not printed.</note> The Department and the
                            Federal Loan Agency would appreciate very much an immediate report on
                            the copper tax questions presented in these instructions.</p>
                        <p>Satisfactory solution of these matters is most important for the assured
                            continuation of Chilean copper supplies on reasonable terms. Information
                            received is to the effect that the Finance Committee of the Congress
                            will report on these matters on November 11 and that decision will be
                            reached shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Loan Agency, which is executing the whole program for
                            procuring adequate copper supplies for defense purposes after full and
                            careful study of the whole situation is of the opinion that a reasonable
                            compromise would be as follows: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) That the
                            present rates of the income tax remain unchanged on the income
                            calculated on the basis of 10 cents c.i.f. New York, (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) That the additional income received as a result of increase
                            in price above this 10 cent figure be subjected to an additional tax of
                            17 percent.</p>
                        <p>The result would be that all net income received on the basis of the 10
                            cent price would pay income tax of 33 percent and all income received
                            additionally on price above 10 cents would pay a 50 percent tax.</p>
                        <p>It is calculated on the basis of prospective purchases of 500,000 tons at
                            11.75 cents this would bring the Chilean Government a tax revenue of
                            roughly 8¾ million dollars more than it received on the basis of the 10
                            cent price, which should be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>This is for your guidance in handling this matter with the appropriate
                            authorities.</p>

                                <p>“The additional price and the initial domestic quotation of 10
                                    cents per pound, would be divided equally between the Chilean
                                    Government and the producers, with the sole limitation that the
                                    former is assured at all times of a minimum of a cent and a
                                    quarter profit per pound. This formula carries with it the idea
                                    that all new increases in price above that of 11¾ cents up to
                                    12½ cents per pound will be entirely for the benefit of the
                                    producers and that only when the price shall reach 12½ cents
                                    will the Chilean Government participate in the new increases of
                                    the domestic price.</p>
                                <p>The proposition contemplates the division of profits in equal
                                    parts as the producers and the Federal Loan Agency desire, since
                                    all the probabilities indicate that the price will go to 12½
                                    cents or more in view of the actual scarcity of copper in the
                                    United States.</p>
                                <p>The Government cannot promise conclusively what will be the final
                                    decision of the Congress but believes that if the formula above
                                    expressed is given prompt acceptance it can be defended with
                                    success in the Chambers before the Presidential election
                                    campaign begins, at which time the matter might be placed before
                                    the public, which might demand more exigent terms.”</p>

                        <p>515. From the Under Secretary. At my request the Chilean Ambassador
                            called to see me on December 2 to discuss the copper tax <pb n="594"
                                xml:id="pg_594" facs="0604"/>question. I handed him a written
                            proposal prepared by the Federal Loan Agency, which was in résumé as
                            follows: <list>

                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>If in future prices are advanced the first ¼ cent would go to
                                    copper companies free of tax and if price were to advance beyond
                                    12 cents CIF New York, the increased revenue would be subject to
                                    further discussion.</item>

                        <p>The Ambassador said he considered the proposal eminently fair and just
                            and would strongly recommend it to his Government for immediate
                            acceptance. I asked the Ambassador for a prompt reply.</p>
                        <p>I am telegraphing you this information in order that you will be aware of
                            what has been done here. However, I feel that until the Chileans have
                            had an opportunity to act on this proposal it would be better that you
                            not initiate any discussions on the subject, but if the Chileans
                            initiate them it would be appreciated if you would point out the
                            desirability of their agreeing speedily. I would appreciate your
                            telegraphing me if there comes to your attention any information which I
                            should have. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>It seems to me that this argument with Chile about copper has gone on
                            long enough. At this particular stage I don’t think that we should
                            permit our general relations with Chile to be jeopardized because of a
                            shortsighted attitude on the part of the Defense Supplies Corporation. I
                            think the Department should step in and cut the Gordian knot. May I have
                            your reaction.</p>

                            circumstances the Department does not feel it desirable to press Chile
                            further with respect to the division between Chile and the copper
                            companies of the increase in the price of copper. The Metals Reserve
                            Company has reluctantly agreed with the Department on this matter and
                            has informed the copper companies. Therefore the Department acquiesces
                            (as an alternative to the unacceptable copper export tax) in the
                            proposal contained in the memorandum of the Chilean Ambassador of
                            November 29, 1941,<note n="87" xml:id="d613fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            which is that any increase in the price of copper over 10 cents a pound
                            will be divided equally between the Chilean Treasury and the producers,
                            provided always that the Chilean Treasury receives a minimum of 1¼
                            cents. Thus at the offered price of 11¾ cents the producers would
                            receive ½ cent of the price increase.</p>

                        <p>623. Department’s 571, December 12, 1 p.m. The Department and the Metals
                            Reserve Company are very anxious that a conclusion be reached in the
                            outstanding matters with Chile—the increased price and production of
                            copper, the copper tax matter, and the overall purchase agreement. In
                            connection with the latter, the Metals Reserve Company has asked the
                            Department to state that recent events will not make any change in the
                            plans of the Metals Reserve Company to proceed with the consummation of
                            the proposed agreement. On the contrary, the Metals Reserve Company
                            proposes (provided that the question of the copper tax is satisfactorily
                            settled) to go through with the proposed overall agreement along the
                            lines and in the spirit discussed to date. Please impress upon the
                            Chilean authorities the necessity for speedy action in these matters,
                            and report fully to the Department.</p>

                        <p>851. The signature of the overall purchase agreement is merely awaiting
                            approval by Chilean Congress of copper tax proposal which the Minister
                            of Finance hopes may be forthcoming within the next few days. The
                            Chilean authorities are very anxious to close the agreement as soon as
                                possible.<note n="88" xml:id="d615fn1">The agreement was completed

                        <p>We have had under consideration the renewal of trade-agreement
                            negotiations with Chile. Recommendations have been made by the
                            trade-agreements organization, and these have been approved by both
                            Assistant Secretary Acheson and the Under Secretary. It is now desired
                            to place the matter before you.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that following announcement of intention to negotiate
                            with Chile, in October 1939,<note n="90" xml:id="d616fn1">October 2,
                                1939; for statement by the Secretary of State, see Department of

                                    >ibid</hi>., December 23, 1939, p. 733.</note> which have since
                            been inactive. The new proposals which we desire to present to the
                            Chilean Government would involve the reinclusion of copper in the
                            negotiations. It is felt that this could best be handled through the
                            issuance of an entirely new notice of intention to negotiate with Chile,
                            thus avoiding any possibility of charges of bad faith by domestic copper
                            interests in view of the withdrawal of copper from the scope of the
                            earlier negotiations. It is our feeling that the present is an excellent
                            time to offer a concession on copper to the Chilean Government: the
                            copper situation has entirely changed since 1939; domestic production,
                            as you know, is entirely inadequate for both defense and civilian
                            purposes; anything we can do to help stimulate <pb n="597"
                                xml:id="pg_597" facs="0607"/>production in Latin America will be of
                            benefit in the defense program; in short, an opportunity is now
                            presented to reduce the tax on copper with the greatest economic benefit
                            and the least political danger.</p>
                        <p>The other products on which we might be able to offer concessions to
                            Chile cover all the items previously considered, and in the case of
                            several of these the trade-agreements organization has recommended some
                            improvements in the earlier offers.</p>
                        <p>The general provisions of the proposed agreement would follow closely the
                            proposals which have been made to Argentina.</p>

                        <p>I think that, in view of past political experience with copper tariff in
                            proposed Chilean trade agreement, including the voluntary withdrawal of
                            the copper item by the Trade Agreements Section under political pressure
                            and presumably because of the lack of sufficient merit to further retain
                            the copper item in the list of proposed or possible concessions, the
                            chief points in connection with the former action of the State
                            Department and in setting forth a new basis for the inclusion of copper
                            in a proposed trade agreement should be placed before the President with
                            the request that he pass particularly on the political phase of the
                            matter. He will probably want to call in Jesse Jones<note n="94"
                                xml:id="d617fn1">Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan

                            with some phase of the copper situation.</p>
                        <p>Both you and the President may find it more practical to feel out the
                            situation among copper mine owners with a view to seeing how much help
                            they would give.</p>
                        <p>I do not think any of the foregoing would compromise our pledges to such
                            Senators as Carl Hayden,<note n="95" xml:id="d617fn2">Senator from
                                Arizona.</note> who boldly supported our trade program and who was
                            among the first Senators to receive information that we had withdrawn
                            the copper item.</p>
                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0608"/>
                        <p>I would naturally be exceedingly glad to see some copper tariff revision.
                            It will require tactful and forceful handling to succeed. Hence the
                            importance of the President’s being actively behind the movement, rather
                            than merely going along with it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Deak Mr. President</hi>: In connection with our
                            program of promoting the closest possible economic relations with the
                            other American republics, we are proposing, if you approve, to renew
                            trade-agreement negotiations with Chile.</p>
                        <p>Copper is one of the principal products on which we might grant a
                            concession to Chile. You will recall that in October 1939 a public
                            notice was issued of intention to negotiate a trade agreement with
                            Chile, followed by an announcement in December of that year withdrawing
                            copper from the negotiations; and that this announcement was decided
                            upon as a result of vigorous protests from the smaller domestic
                            producers and their representatives in Congress. The negotiations with
                            Chile have since been inactive.</p>
                        <p>The copper situation today differs radically from that existing a year or
                            more ago. Defense and normal civilian needs now far exceed domestic
                            production, and we are importing as much as possible from Chile and
                            other American countries. I understand also that it is proposed to
                            subsidize production in high-cost domestic mines. However, even under
                            present conditions, it may be anticipated that there would be political
                            opposition to a reduction in the copper tax.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary believes that you will probably wish to pass particularly
                            on the political aspects of a new public notice of intention to
                            negotiate a trade agreement with Chile involving the possibility of a
                            reduction in the copper tax. He suggests also that you may wish to
                            consult with the Federal Loan Administrator and others who are familiar
                            with various aspects of the present copper situation. As the matter is
                            one that the Secretary feels will require tactful and forceful handling,
                            he wishes to be assured of your active support of any action which may
                            be taken.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: There is enclosed a copy
                            of a letter of July 18, 1941 to the President from the Acting
                                Secretary<note n="97" xml:id="d619fn1"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Supra</hi>.</note> regarding renewal of trade-agreement
                            negotiations with Chile, involving the possibility of a reduction in the
                            import tax on copper. In approving the proposed action, the President
                            requested, pursuant to the Secretary’s suggestion, that you be
                            consulted.</p>
                        <p>You are of course familiar with the history of the copper tax, which was
                            never justifiable, and the manner in which it was enacted in 1932. As
                            shown by the developments in 1939 referred to in the enclosed letter, it
                            would normally be very difficult to reduce the copper tax. However, the
                            present situation offers a more favorable opportunity to do so than is
                            ever likely to exist again. In this connection, the Secretary has
                            expressed himself in favor of revision of the tax.</p>
                        <p>The benefits to our general economy from a lower copper tariff are
                            long-range rather than immediate, as we must look in the future to Latin
                            America as an increasingly important source of copper at a reasonable
                            price. An immediate effect, however, would be to save that portion of
                            the funds of the Federal Loan Agency which now must be turned over to
                            the Treasury in the form of the tax on the large volume of copper being
                            imported by the Metals Reserve Company. A reduction in the tax in the
                            near future would also be a factor in negotiating a trade agreement with
                            Chile and thus in furthering the important object of hemisphere
                            solidarity.</p>
                        <p>If, before expressing your views on this subject, you would like to
                            discuss it further, I shall of course be glad to do so at your
                            convenience.</p>

                                    the above-quoted Resolution, recommends that any such tariff
                                    preferences, in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of
                                    trade, should be made effective through trade agreements
                                    embodying tariff reductions or exemptions; that the parties to
                                    such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate
                                    the customs duties on like imports from other countries; and
                                    that any such regional tariff preferences should not be

                                    reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the

                        <p>This proposal was referred to subcommittee II for consideration. The
                            subcommittee subsequently approved the formula but the Chilean
                            representative refrained from voting. When the subcommittee’s
                            recommendation was submitted to the full committee on August 7 the
                            Chilean Ambassador stated that his Government was satisfied with
                            Resolution LXXX and objected to the penultimate point in the proposed
                            formula (reservation of right to reduce duties on like imports from
                            third countries) and considered the last point rather vague.</p>
                        <p>After extended discussions, this formula was accepted with great

                            the principle of non-discriminatory treatment underlying this
                            Government’s commercial policy tariff preferences to contiguous
                            countries. Further background information in this regard may be obtained
                            by telephone from the Embassy at Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean representatives here seem to feel that the penultimate point
                            conflicts with the Chilean Government’s present policy of exclusive
                            preferences to contiguous countries. It has been pointed out to them by
                            representatives of Argentina, Brazil, and this Government that the mere
                            reservation of such a right by Chile and contiguous countries would not
                            necessarily mean that it would be invoked; Chile might in certain
                            circumstances consider it advantageous, after consultation with the
                            contiguous country concerned, to invoke the reservation; if a country
                            contiguous to Chile wished to invoke it, Chile might have no objection
                            to the reduction in duty to a third country or countries; if Chile
                            should have an objection, the other country might abandon its proposal,
                            or a mutually satisfactory adjustment might be worked out, because of
                            its desire to maintain good trade relations with Chile; such an
                            adjustment might possibly involve the third country concerned.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the above quoted contractual formula represents the full
                            extent to which this Government feels it could go, in connection with a
                            trade agreement with Chile, in meeting the Chilean request for a blanket
                            exception in favor of contiguous countries. In this connection, active
                            study is now being given to the possibility of renewing trade-agreement
                            negotiations with Chile on as broad a basis as possible.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss this matter immediately with the appropriate
                            Chilean officials with a view to removing any objections they may have
                            to the formula in order that when this matter comes before the
                            Inter-American committee for action on August 14 the Chilean
                            representatives will support the proposal. Action on that date is
                            desired in order to have this question settled prior to and in order to
                            facilitate the early conclusion of our trade agreement with
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>You may also have an occasion to point out that thus far the
                            recommendations of the committee have been adopted unanimously.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called by request and was handed a memorandum<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d622fn2">Not printed.</note> embodying proposals by this
                            Government looking toward the renewal of trade-agreement negotiations
                            with Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins outlined the principal points included in the new proposals
                            and reviewed the situation preceding the time in 1940 when the
                            negotiations became inactive. It was pointed out to the Ambassador that
                            changed conditions now made it possible for this Government to indicate
                            to the Chilean Government the possibility of improving the offers which
                            had previously been made on Chilean products imported into the United
                            States. These included the possibility of a concession on copper, which
                            had been withdrawn from the earlier negotiations, and on certain other
                            commodities on which it had not previously been found possible to offer
                            any concessions. Mr. Hawkins also commented on two of the principal
                            points in the general provisions on which no agreement had been reached
                            in the earlier negotiations: the article on exchange control and the
                            question of customs preferences by Chile to contiguous countries. With
                            respect to the exchange control article, Mr. Hawkins pointed out that we
                            were withdrawing our previous proposal which called for making exchange
                            available without delay for all permitted imports into Chile from the
                            United States and were proposing in its place an article which would
                            provide merely for most-favored-nation treatment. With respect to the
                            question of preferences by Chile to contiguous countries, particular
                            emphasis was placed by Mr. Hawkins on the fact that, as the Ambassador
                            was probably aware, the Secretary of State had always vigorously
                            supported the principle of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment.
                            As a result, however, of our recognition of the fact that we had
                            supported Resolution LXXX at the Montevideo conference in 1933 on
                            Commercial Advantages between Neighboring States, we had in connection
                            with our trade-agreement discussions with Argentina somewhat receded
                            from our original position to the extent of agreeing to a contractual
                            formula under which we would not claim most-favored-nation treatment in
                            the <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0613"/>case of preferences granted
                            under certain conditions in trade between contiguous countries. It was
                            recalled to the Ambassador that this was the formula which had been
                            presented by Argentina and Brazil to the Inter-American Economic and
                            Financial Advisory Committee and which was now under consideration by
                            that group.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was requested to treat the new proposals as strictly
                            confidential in advance of any public announcement by this Government of
                            trade-agreement negotiations which might result from reopening
                            discussions with Chile. The Ambassador stated that he would study the
                            proposals and call Mr. Hawkins in a few days with a view to bringing in
                            the Commercial Counselor of the Embassy for a more detailed discussion
                            of the matter.</p>

                        <p>In the discussions with Chilean officials following the announcement on
                            October 2, 1939, of intention to negotiate a trade agreement, it
                            developed that the Government of Chile desired to except from the
                            operation of the unconditional most-favored-nation clause tariff
                            preferences to contiguous countries. Representatives of the United
                            States Government pointed out that no such exception was contained in
                            the existing <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> with Chile, and
                            explained how extremely difficult it would be for the United States, in
                            view of its long-established commercial policy, to agree to such an
                            exception.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently this same question arose in connection with the exploratory
                            discussions with officials of the Argentine Government. The attention of
                            the Government of the United States was drawn to Resolution LXXX of the
                            Seventh International Conference of American States at Montevideo,
                            approved December 24, 1933. After careful study, in the light of that
                            resolution, the Government of the United States agreed, as part of the
                            basis for the public notice of May 13, 1941 of intention to negotiate a
                            trade agreement with Argentina,<note n="3" xml:id="d623fn1">For
                                correspondence concerning a reciprocal trade agreement with

                            exchange of notes providing that if, pursuant to the resolution, the

                            recommend a contractual formula for preferences to contiguous countries
                            identical with the one submitted to that Committee on July 31, 1941
                            jointly by the representatives of the Governments of Argentina and
                            Brazil, the Government of the United States <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604"
                                facs="0614"/>would not invoke the provisions of Article I
                            (most-favored-nation treatment) of the proposed trade agreement between
                            the United States and Argentina for the purpose of obtaining the benefit
                            of tariff preferences conforming to the contractual formula which
                            Argentina might accord to a contiguous country, it being understood, of
                            course, that if any such preference should be extended by Argentina to
                            any noncontiguous country it would be extended immediately and
                            unconditionally to the United States. However, this agreement on the
                            part of the United States was conditioned upon the inclusion in a Final
                            Minute of the negotiations assurances by the Argentine Government that,
                            prior to according any such preference, with respect to any product of
                            interest to the United States, it would in practice afford the
                            Government of the United States adequate opportunity for consultation
                            through the medium of a mixed commission to be established under the
                            provisions of the proposed trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>Similar provisions are included in the new proposals relative to a trade
                            agreement which are now submitted by the Government of the United States
                            to the Government of Chile.</p>

                        <p>319. Department’s 261, August 12, 7 p.m. The formula mentioned has not
                            yet been approved by the Inter-American Committee, as the Chilean
                            representative is not yet prepared to withdraw his objection.</p>
                        <p>The possibility exists, particularly in view of the fact that on August
                            28 we handed new trade agreement proposals embodying the formula <pb

                            abstaining from voting on the formula in the Committee, Chile will be
                            placed in a special and more favorable position, vis-à-vis this
                            Government, than Argentina, Brazil and other countries supporting the
                            resolution, when the question of preferences to contiguous countries
                            arises in trade-agreement discussions with the United States.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss again with the appropriate officials the
                            substance of the Department’s 261, and if you have reason to believe the
                            Chilean Government is adopting an attitude such as that suggested above,
                            you should emphasize that the formula represents the full extent to
                            which this Government believes it can go, and that unless the Chilean
                            Government’s representative on the Committee is authorized to refrain
                            from objecting to the formula when it comes up for action before the
                            Committee, it would naturally make it extremely difficult, and perhaps
                            impossible, to work out a basis for the resumption of trade-agreement
                            negotiations with this Government. It is hoped that instructions for a
                            favorable vote on the formula will be sent to the Chilean representative
                            before the next Committee meeting on September 18.<note n="6"

                                would suggest changes (611.2531/691). The Department then left the
