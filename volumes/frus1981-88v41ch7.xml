                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                            administration’s first term, policymakers were ambivalent about

                            (CFCs). While the linkage between CFCs and ozone depletion was theorized
                            as early as 1974, and the United States banned certain CFCs in 1978,
                            many <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> officials were
                            skeptical of the environmental cost. On March 31, 1981, <persName

                            expected that the Convention will improve international understanding of
                            the ozone problem and would provide the additional research and

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss> issue centers on the question

                            opposed this requirement, which has been supported by the U.S. and

                            the general character of many of the provisions, we want to consider
                            carefully whether we want to be bound by compulsory settlement, whether
                            by the International Court of Justice (“<gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>”) or by arbitration. The text presently provides for
                            both unless a party “opts-out” of the provision at the time of
                            ratification. The sentiment of several countries, including the U.S., is
                            that the text is not clearly drafted and requires more work. After
                            careful review of the Convention and its negotiating history, the U.S.
                            position is that the final text of the Convention must not provide for
                            compulsory third party dispute settlement, including reference to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> as well as to binding
                            arbitration. With respect to any reference to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>, it is desirable that a party not be
                            required to act affirmatively to remove itself from the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>’s compulsory jurisdiction, although if
                            such an “opt out” provision (properly drafted) is the only outstanding
                            issue in an otherwise satisfactory treaty, we would propose to proceed
                            with signature.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that these issues will be resolved in Vienna and that the
                            Convention will be adopted and opened for signature at the conclusion of
                            the conference. Assuming those issues are resolved to the Department’s
                            satisfaction and no other unforseen obstacles arise, the U.S. negotiator
                            will sign the Convention at that time. To be in the position to do so,
                            the Delegation will provide to the Department, particularly L, daily
                            telegraphic or telephonic reports relating to the dispute settlement and

                        <p>The Convention will serve as a framework agreement for possible further
                            measures included in future protocols. A first supporting control
                            protocol to the Convention, which would provide for reductions in

                            accordance with the Circular 175 authorization of November 29, 1982.
                            However, the text of that protocol is not yet satisfactory, and it is
                            not believed that any protocol will be adopted at the Vienna <pb

                            the wisdom of proceeding with the protocol, in view of recent scientific

                        <p>There are two supplementary annexes to the Convention describing a
                            variety of research and monitoring actions, as well as cooperation in
                            information exchange and technical assistance.<note n="8"

                        <p>The Convention would establish a Secretariat and a Conference of the
                            Parties. Secretariat services would be provided within an existing
                            international body (initially <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>,
                            and later, possibly the World Meteorological Organization—<gloss

                            international organization. The Convention itself contains no mandatory
                            financial obligations (financial rules and financial provisions
                            governing the Secretariat are to be adopted by the Conference of the

                            will need to be financially supported by those states that become party
                            to it. In signing the Convention, the U.S. would be making a commitment
                            in principle to pay its fair share of the future expenses of a small
                            Secretariat and meetings of the Contracting Parties. The Convention
                            calls for <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> to provide secretariat
                            services, absorbed in its own budget, through the first meeting of the
                            parties (in approximately two years). The Contracting Parties will then
                            designate a permanent Secretariat.</p>

                                target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> is particularly concerned that
                            assessed contributions are effectively uncontrollable. <gloss
                                target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> notes that the United States already
                            participates in organizations such as <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1"
                                >UNEP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss>, which <gloss
                                target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> believes have the competence to carry
                            out the mandate of the Convention within their current and proposed
                            budgets. In addition to the assessed contributions to support the
                            Secretariat, becoming party to the Convention will also entail hidden
                            costs for the travel of U.S. delegates to meetings.</p>
                        <p>However, the U.S. departments and agencies that have been substantially
                            involved in the Convention negotiations believe that the Convention is a
                            desirable international environmental agreement to protect the ozone
                            layer, not only as a mechanism to exchange information and research, but
                            also as a framework agreement for possible future protocols. Therefore,
                            the Department would plan, providing you approve the recommendation
                            below, to ask <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> and the Congress
                            (assuming the Convention enters into force and the U.S. became a party
                            after advice and consent to ratification by the Senate) to approve
                            funding at an appropriate level beginning in the FY 1988 budget for
                            appropriate secretariat and other expenses in support of the
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>Assuming <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss> is selected as the
                            permanent secretariat, funding would be included in the Department’s
                            regular assessment to <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss>. U.S. costs
                            are tentatively estimated at approximately $60,000 annually during the
                            first two years of operation of the Convention. (By way of comparison,
                            the total <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss> budget in FY 1985 amounts
                            to $18.75 million, of which the assessed contribution of the U.S. is
                            $4.6 million.)</p>
                        <p>In sum, we anticipate that no new organization will be created to serve
                            as secretariat to the Convention. In the course of the negotiations
                            there has been support for use of the <gloss target="#t_WMO_1"
                                >WMO</gloss> as the Secretariat, and it is likely that <gloss
                                target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss> will become the permanent secretariat
                            to the Convention beginning in 1987 or 1988 (assuming that the
                            Convention has entered into force). It is expected that the additional
                            costs for the <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss> budget will be about
                            $250,000 annually. The U.S. will work to have these costs absorbed by
                            reduction in other program costs. However, it is possible that the U.S.
                            assessment to <gloss target="#t_WMO_1">WMO</gloss> for these additional
                            costs of servicing the Convention will be up to $60,000 annually
                            beginning in FY 1988. A more detailed discussion of the financial
                            implications of the Convention is attached (Tab E).<note n="10"

                        <p>As the memorandum of law (Tab C) indicates, the Convention would be

                            ratification. We have determined that signature of the Convention would
                            not have significant environmental impacts inside or outside the United

                                xml:id="d351fn2"><ref target="#d350">Document 350</ref>.</note> I am
                            also opposed to the basic Convention. Although it might seem to provide
                            only for <pb facs="1049" n="1003" xml:id="pg_1003"/> research, and thus
                            be harmless, even in research it would do more harm than good. It also
                            is expressly intended to provide an umbrella for international
                            regulation, such as that in the draft protocol.</p>
                        <p>In the past our research on environmental matters has been conducted in
                            parallel in different countries, without vesting it in an international
                            organization. Experience shows that it is wise to do things that way. In
                            the particular case of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s, European
                            scientists and environmental authorities have shown a healthy skepticism
                            toward U.S. activism, and have correctly pointed out the major gaps in
                            existing knowledge. The proposed Convention would set up an
                            international scientific “authority” that would tend to override and
                            suppress the healthy cross-checking by scientists in different
                            countries. Furthermore, officials in our regulatory agencies have seen
                            international regulation as a way to circumvent and override U.S.
                            policy, which aims toward deregulation in many areas. These tendencies
                            should be curbed, not encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I think that it was a mistake to authorize the negotiations
                            toward this Convention in the first place. Although things are now at an
                            advanced stage, we have already shown our willingness to pull back (as
                            in the “Law of the Sea” case, among others) when a closer look shows
                            that an international treaty or other policy is fundamentally
                                flawed.<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">After this sentence, an unknown
                                hand drew an asterisk that corresponds to a handwritten notation at

                            integration organizations (<gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss>’s),
                            were resolved after intensive negotiations along the lines of the U.S.
                            proposals. As neither Toronto Group (Australia, Canada, Finland, Norway,
                            Sweden, Switzerland, U.S.) nor <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> had
                            changed their respective positions on control measures for
                            chlorofluorocarbons (<gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s) since the
                            January meeting of the ad hoc working group, there were no further
                            negotiations in Vienna on a <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            protocol. U.S. continued to resist <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                            proposals involving production capacity cap on <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss>’s. Instead, we proposed a resolution which, after hard
                            negotiations, was passed by the conference. The resolution: (a) called
                            for continued negotiations based on updated scientific and economic
                            research, (b) proposed a workshop on economic implications of various
                            ways to protect the ozone layer, (c) authorized the Executive Director
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> to convene a diplomatic
                            conference, if possible in 1987, to adopt a protocol and, (d) urged
                            states to control their emissions of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss>’s pending entry into force of a protocol. With release
                            of <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_WMO_1"
                                >WMO</gloss>-sponsored international scientific assessment not
                            expected until later this year, most delegations and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> agreed that further negotiations on
                            a protocol would probably not take place before spring 1986.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> Executive Director Tolba’s
                            keynote speech warned of potential dangers to future generations from
                            ozone depletion and noted that this convention marked the first global
                            anticipatory approach to <pb facs="1051" n="1005" xml:id="pg_1005"/> an
                            environmental issue. Despite sometimes hard negotiations between
                            U.S.-led Toronto group and <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>,
                            atmosphere was friendly and cooperative. Austrian Chairman (<persName
                                corresp="#p_LK_1">Lang</persName>, <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss>) proved effective mediator at critical moments. Several
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s, notably Argentina, Brazil,
                            and Egypt, played active and generally constructive roles. Soviets stuck
                            to the substance and also signed the convention. Japan did not sign.
                            Meeting was free from irrelevant political controversy. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. General Business. The meeting was opened by Tolba, and a welcoming
                            address by Kurt Steyrer, Austrian Minister for Health and Environmental
                            Protection. Winifred Lang (Austria) was elected President. Vice
                            Presidents included Nascimento E Silva (Brazil), Mohammed El-Taher Shash
                            (Egypt), Rune Loenugren (Sweden), and Yuri Sedunov (<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>). Willem Kakabeeke (Netherlands),
                            who served as rapporteur, and Alberto Daverede (Argentina), who served
                            as Chairman of the Drafting Committee, completed the Bureau. A quick
                            U.S. intervention to expand the Bureau ensured the Toronto Group’s
                            representation via Sweden.</p>
                        <p>4. Settlement of Disputes. Consideration of Article 11 on settlement of
                            disputes was taken up by an informal working group chaired by the
                            rapporteur. The group agreed to focus discussion on the U.S. draft,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d352fn2">Not further identified.</note> which provided
                            for quote opting in unquote to third party dispute settlement, and a
                            Swedish paper, based on the U.S.’ text, which provided for quote opting
                            out unquote. After an unexpectedly short discussion (and without real
                            resistance from Sweden), the working group, subject to <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> reservation on compulsory
                            conciliation, agreed to use U.S. text and opting in approach as basis
                            for further work. In face of strong arguments by U.S. and others that
                            U.S. text presented a balanced package compromise, Soviets acquiesced in
                            compulsory conciliation. While noting appreciation to U.S. for its
                            efforts in producing an annex on arbitration, conference decided that
                            there was insufficient time to complete a text. Instead, a provision was
                            inserted in the U.S. draft calling upon the conference of the parties to
                            adopt arbitral procedures at its first meeting. (Sweden offered to
                            assist the U.S., if so requested, in presenting a text at that
                            meeting.)</p>
                        <p>Australia proposed that the Conference of the Parties also be charged
                            with preparing more detailed conciliation procedures. While many in the
                            group, including the U.S., noted the merits of the proposal, Australia
                            withdrew it when it appeared that the extra element might cause an
                            unravelling of the compromise. The U.S. text, as modified, was
                            subsequently adopted by consensus by the plenary, with a few minor
                            drafting changes.</p>

                        <p>5. At the conclusion of the conference, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
                            Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,
                            Switzerland, and the U.K. joined in a declaration, appended to the final

                                    >UN</gloss> Environment Programme, “Vienna Convention for the
                                Protection of the Ozone Layer.” (accessed online)</note> expressing
                            their regret that a system of compulsory third party dispute settlement
                            (as opposed to opting in,) was not provided for in the convention and
                            appealed to states to so opt in as provided for in Article 11 of the
                            convention. (Comment: It is interesting that, with such an apparent
                            array of support for compulsory dispute settlement, the opting in
                            approach was adopted so easily and quickly. Some of the countries named
                            above had never publicly spoken in support of compulsory dispute
                            settlement at any time during the more than three years of negotiations.
                            It might be that, once it was finally agreed that there would be an
                            opting in procedure, it was not all that difficult to take a strong
                            stand on compulsory dispute settlement via a resolution. End
                            comment.)</p>
                        <p>6. Participation by Regional Economic Integration Organizations (<gloss
                                target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss>’s). Resolution of this issue proved,
                            as expected, to be the toughest issue of the conference. As U.S. was
                            advised in advance, the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> came to the
                            meeting with position taken in Council to oppose any kind of member
                            state qualification to <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> adherence
                            (FYI: U.K. (protect) informed U.S. delegation that U.K., Denmark, and
                            Netherlands (which later reversed its stand) had opposed <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> position, initially proposed as a matter
                            of principle by France, which had not expected support for its proposal.
                            End FYI.)</p>
                        <p>7. Consideration of this issue was almost entirely handled through
                            informal meetings, including meetings with the conference president.
                            Representatives from various regional groupings, including <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Canada, were involved. The view
                            generally expressed was that the convention could not discriminate in
                            favor of the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> as opposed to other
                            regional organizations. (In this regard, Egypt raised some potentially
                            troublesome questions as to whether organizations eligible to
                            participate in convention had to be quote economically integrated
                            unquote and noted the Arab League as an example.) There was general
                            agreement that for regional organizations to adhere to the convention,
                            they had to have competence over matters governed by the convention and
                            the legal capacity to enter into international agreements covered by
                            those matters. Egypt made a formal declaration, the gist of which was
                            that subject to their having such competence, the Arab League and the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> were not ruled out.</p>
                        <pb facs="1053" n="1007" xml:id="pg_1007"/>
                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> initially took an unyielding
                            position on any requirement for member state adherence in addition to
                            the commission itself, asserting that the U.S.-proposed language quote
                            subordinated unquote the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and
                            challenged its very existence. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Legal
                            Director-General Ellerman arrived from Brussels March 19 and, in meeting
                            he requested with U.S. representatives <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                                >Benedick</persName>, insisted that, if the U.S. did not change its
                            position, <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and member states would not
                            sign the convention. U.S. reps resisted <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> interpretation of quote subordination unquote noting
                            that our primary concern was that parties to a convention be able to
                            fulfill all of its obligations and responsibilities and that, if an
                                <gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss> did not have exclusive
                            competence in the subject matter, this lacuna needed to be filled by one
                            or more member states. U.S. also noted that this view was shared by a
                            number of other delegations, including Canada, Australia, and some Latin
                            countries, in addition to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> attempt to portray issue as
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–U.S. confrontation was thus
                            frustrated, and both Tolba and the Austrian Chairman put heavy pressure
                            on <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>9. Later on March 19, the U.S. informally circulated the <gloss
                                target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss> text attached to its position
                                paper<note n="4" xml:id="d352fn4">Not found.</note> to other
                            delegations and to <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, as a possible
                            basis for compromise. Not only <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> (which
                            had been provided text along similar lines last January) but also <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> member states indicated that they had
                            never seen text. In any event, such disavowal may have provided useful
                            face-saving mechanism for <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> which,
                            after communication with Brussels, indicated its general acceptance of
                            U.S. draft with minor changes—much to the relief of rest of
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> did not want to have a blunt
                            statement, as contained in the U.S. draft, providing for an <gloss
                                target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss> to have one vote if none of its
                            member states were party to the convention or relevant protocols. Some
                            complex drafting managed to produce the same effect, but in a less
                            direct way. After a detailed explanation of draft to <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, production by <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> of a short paper as to its legal
                            competence to become party to the convention, and <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            bilateral discussions, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> indicated
                            its acceptance of U.S. draft as modified. The final voting text states
                            the principle that each party has one vote, but that <gloss
                                target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss>’s could exercise a number of votes
                            equal to the number of their members who are party to the relevant
                            instrument, and that neither <gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss>’s
                            nor member states can exercise their right to vote if the other
                            does.</p>
                        <p>11. U.S. made declaration at conclusion of conference (appended to Final
                            Act) that it understands new article on voting to provide that when an

                                >REIO</gloss> and its member states. This declaration was shown in
                            advance to <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> delegation, who understood
                            it and made no objection.</p>

                            informally to U.S. for our efforts in seeking a compromise on this

                            informally mentioned to U.S. delegation that text should be seen only in
                            context of this convention and should not be necessarily regarded as a

                        <p>13. Definition of Adverse Effects. Pursuant to a New Zealand suggestion,
                            the conference agreed to add quote effects on materials useful to
                            mankind unquote to the definition of adverse effects consistent with one
                            reference thereto in Article 3 on research and monitoring and in Annex 1
                            on research and monitoring.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> Resolution. After intensive
                            negotiations, the conference adopted a resolution on
                            chlorofluorocarbons. The text is close to the draft text developed by
                            the Toronto Group (<gloss target="#t_TG_1">TG</gloss>). Work on the
                            resolution took up virtually the entire informal working group meeting
                            (March 14–15), and negotiations between the <gloss target="#t_TG_1"
                                >TG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> continued
                            during the conference itself. At the beginning of the informal working
                            group meeting, <gloss target="#t_TG_1">TG</gloss> members expressed
                            their preference for the protocol developed by the ad hoc working group
                            in January with the multi-option alternative for the control article.
                            Noting that this would be unlikely, however, U.S. indicated it could
                            accept a resolution aimed at continuation of negotiations. This was
                            accepted as reasonable by all parties, and the chairman convened a small
                            drafting group with representatives of <gloss target="#t_TG_1"
                                >TG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s, Soviets, and Japan.</p>
                        <p>15. The main purpose of this resolution was to demonstrate that, after
                            two years of negotiations on a protocol to regulate <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> emissions, the International Community
                            wished to continue this work, based on updated scientific and economic
                            research. While the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> had taken certain
                            measures, primarily a production capacity cap, and the U.S., Canada, and
                            others had banned nonessential <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> use
                            in aerosols, other major producers, notably <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and Japan had done virtually nothing, and the question
                            of potential future <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> production by
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s was unresolved. Thus, due to
                            the global nature of the problem of ozone depletion, some global
                            harmonization of regulatory policies appears necessary.</p>
                        <p>16. The text of the resolution, appended, represents a true compromise,
                            after days of intensive negotiation and informal meetings. The <gloss
                                target="#t_TG_1">TG</gloss> originally wanted a statement of intent
                            by producer countries to reduce <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s
                            in aerosols by at least 50 percent from peak year production during the
                            interim period while a protocol was developed, but the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, although currently at 38 percent,
                            resisted any fixed number. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> also
                            wanted explicit recognition of the production capacity <pb facs="1055"
                                n="1009" xml:id="pg_1009"/> cap in this paragraph as equivalent in
                            effect to the aerosol reduction, but this was resisted by U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_TG_1">TG</gloss>. The resulting compromise
                            paragraph 6 urges states quote to control their emissions of <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s, inter alia in aerosols, by any
                            means at their disposal, including controls on production or use, to the
                            maximum extent practicable unquote. (FYI: during negotiations on this
                            para, several <gloss target="#t_TG_1">TG</gloss> countries—Canada,
                            Sweden, Finland, Australia—expressed the view that, if it was impossible
                            to get a figure of at least 50 percent, they preferred strong,
                            nonquantitative language. End FYI)</p>
                        <p>17. Another contentious issue was whether there should be a fixed
                            deadline for completion of work on a protocol, to encourage serious
                            discussions. This was resolved by a U.S.-proposed compromise calling on
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> Executive Director to convene
                            a new diplomatic conference quote if possible in 1987 unquote. All
                            parties agreed on the necessity of basing any protocol on sound
                            scientific research, and all endorsed convening a workshop to examine
                            economic implications of alternative strategies for protecting the ozone
                            layer</p>
                        <p>18. By Thursday<note n="5" xml:id="d352fn5">March 21.</note> noon,
                            agreement was reached with the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> on all
                            issues. In the afternoon the chairman presented it to the full meeting
                            and was of considerable assistance in resisting attempts by Spain,
                            Egypt, and Japan to tamper with this text. The full text of the
                            resolution is in para. 24.</p>
                        <p>19. The only other resolution of significance noted the willingness of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> to contribute to the costs of
                            the interim secretariat and noted with appreciation the willingness of
                            both <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_WMO_1"
                                >WMO</gloss> to be the permanent secretariat. The <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> noted that it would contribute to the
                            permanent secretariat.</p>
                        <p>20. Conclusion, the U.S. had a significant impact on the outcome of the
                            negotiations, mainly in corridors, informal meetings, and in the
                            drafting committee. The U.S. was instrumental not only in achieving
                            compromise on the settlement of disputes and <gloss target="#t_REIO_1"
                                >REIO</gloss> issues, but also on a resolution which, while
                            continuing international negotiations on a protocol, did not prejudge
                            any results and stressed the importance of sound scientific research and
                            economic analysis.</p>

                        <p>22. Countries signing the convention included Argentina, Belgium,
                            Byelorussian SSR, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, the

                            other countries, including Australia, and U.K., indicated their
                            intention to sign in the near future</p>
                        <p>23. Future Work. Note to <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>: Rapid
                            action is needed in the U.S. to begin organizing the economic workshop
                            (see para 24 (2) below). While the workshop would probably be held in
                            Europe to attract the maximum number of European participants, the U.S.
                            should take the lead in determining the host government and in planning
                            the workshop. The <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> also needs to
                            determine if it wishes to co-sponsor such a workshop</p>

                        <p>The Conference</p>
                        <p>Noting with appreciation that the Convention for the Protection of the
                            Ozone Layer was opened for signature in Vienna on 22 March 1985,</p>
                        <p>Bearing in mind decision 8/78 adopted on 29 April 1980 by the Governing
                            Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>),</p>
                        <p>Considering that the convention is an important step to protect the ozone
                            layer from modifications due to human activities,</p>
                        <p>Noting that Article 2 of the Convention establishes an obligation to take
                            appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against
                            adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities
                            which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer,</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the possibility that world-wide emissions and use of fully
                            halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (<gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s)
                            and other chlorine-containing substances can significantly deplete and
                            otherwise modify the ozone layer, leading to potentially adverse effects
                            on human health, crops, marine life, materials and climate, and
                            recognizing at the same time the need to further assess possible
                            modifications and their potentially adverse effects,</p>
                        <p>Mindful of the precautionary measures for controlling emissions and use
                            of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s that have already been taken
                            at national and regional levels, but recognizing that such measures
                            might not be sufficient for protecting the ozone layer,</p>
                        <pb facs="1057" n="1011" xml:id="pg_1011"/>
                        <p>Determined therefore to continue negotiations on the development of a
                            protocol to control equitably global production, emissions and use of
                                <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s,</p>
                        <p>Mindful that special consideration should be given to the particular
                            situation of developing countries,</p>
                        <p>Mindful also of the relationship between the level of industrialization
                            of a state and its responsibilities for the protection of the ozone
                            layer,</p>
                        <p>Noting the considerable progress made by the ad hoc working group of
                            legal and technical experts for the elaboration of a global framework
                            convention for the protection of the ozone layer to develop a protocol
                            concerning <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s, but further noting
                            that the working group was not in a position to complete its work on the
                            protocol,</p>
                        <p>(1.) Pending the entry into force of the convention, requests the
                            Executive Director of <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>, on the
                            basis of the work of the ad hoc working group, to convene a working
                            group to continue work on a protocol that addresses both short and long
                            term strategies to control equitably global production, emissions and
                            use of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s, taking into account the
                            particular situation of developing countries as well as updated
                            scientific and economic research;</p>
                        <p>(2.) Urges all interested parties, in order to facilitate work on a
                            protocol, to co-operate in studies leading to a more common
                            understanding of possible scenarios for global production, emissions and

                            OZONE PROTECTION</p>
                        <p>Based on current scientific understanding, considerable risks may exist
                            to human health and the environment from continued or expanded global
                            emissions of fully halogenated alkanes. Considerable evidence exists,
                            both in theory and from models, linking these chemicals to depletion of
                            ozone. However, remaining scientific uncertainties prevent any
                            conclusive statement concerning safe levels of emissions. As a result,
                            we believe that these chemicals should be considered suspect, and, given
                            the substantial human health and environmental risks, we believe that a
                            prudent protocol should provide for the following:</p>
                        <p>I. As a first step, a near-term freeze on the emissions of all fully
                            halogenated alkanes (i.e., <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 11, 12,
                            113, and Halon 1211 and 1301) at or near current levels;</p>
                        <pb facs="1060" n="1014" xml:id="pg_1014"/>
                        <p>II. A long-term scheduled phaseout of emissions of these chemicals; this
                            phaseout would be implemented, subject to any modification resulting
                            from periodic review as defined in III;</p>
                        <p>III. A periodic review of the protocol provisions based upon a regular
                            assessment of scientific understanding of changes to the ozone layer and
                            its effects on health and the environment. The review could remove or
                            add chemicals from the phaseout, change the schedule, or set an emission
                            reduction target short of phaseout.</p>
                        <p>A protocol based on the above elements should have the following
                            characteristics:</p>
                        <p>(a) provide a simple approach to facilitate agreement on an acceptable

                        <p>Whether to authorize negotiation of a protocol to the Vienna Convention
                            for the Protection of the Ozone Layer which would control emissions of
                            ozone-depleting substances.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>There is general scientific agreement that human activities are
                            substantially altering the chemistry of the atmosphere in ways which
                            threaten both the quantity and the vertical distribution of ozone.
                            Certain chlorine and bromine substances, when emitted into the
                            atmosphere, act as catalysts in a series of chemical reactions resulting
                            in a depletion of ozone. Ozone depletion, by permitting greater
                            quantities of harmful ultra-violet radiation to reach the earth’s
                            surface, will pose significant, even if currently difficult to quantify,
                            risks for health and ecosystems. Given the complex chemistry and
                            dynamics of the atmosphere, scientific uncertainties currently prevent a
                            conclusive determination of safe levels of emissions. Because of the
                            long atmospheric lifetime of these molecules, emissions affect the ozone
                            layer for decades. The nature of the ozone layer requires international
                            action if protective measures are to be effective.</p>
                        <p>The chemicals at issue for this protocol—chlorofluorocarbons (“CFCs”) and
                            some bromine compounds—have substantial economic and social value, being
                            widely used in refrigeration, foam-blowing, fire-extinguishers, as
                            solvents, and in most countries as aerosols. (Their use in non-essential
                            aerosols was banned in the United States in 1978.) <pb facs="1062"

                            monitoring and information exchange. The Convention obliges the Parties
                            to cooperate in taking measures to protect human health and the

                            human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer.
                            The Diplomatic Conference which adopted the Convention did not reach
                            agreement, however, on a protocol to control emissions of

                            measures, followed by resumption of negotiations, looking toward
                            adoption of a control protocol in 1987 if possible. Negotiations are to
                            resume December 1, 1986, with a diplomatic conference to conclude the

                        <p>Our approach in the international negotiations is intended to influence
                            those negotiations to achieve the most effective international agreement
                            possible. It does not prejudge the <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>
                            Administrator’s decision on domestic regulation.</p>
                        <p>Although considerable evidence exists linking certain chlorine and
                            bromine substances to depletion of ozone, remaining scientific
                            uncertainties prevent any conclusive statement concerning safe levels of
                            emissions. As a result, the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_EPA_1"
                                >EPA</gloss> recommends an international risk management strategy
                            which would give a strong incentive for rapid development and employment
                            of emission controls, recycling practices and safer substitute
                            chemicals. We should therefore seek a protocol that explicitly or in
                            effect provides for:</p>
                        <p>I. A near-term freeze on the combined emissions of the most
                            ozone-depleting substances;</p>
                        <p>II. A long-term scheduled reduction of emissions of these chemicals down
                            to the point of eliminating emissions from all but limited uses for
                            which no substitutes are commercially available (such reduction could be
                            as much as 95%), subject to III; and</p>
                        <p>III. Periodic review of the protocol provisions based upon regular
                            assessment of the science. The review could remove or add chemicals, or
                            change the schedule or the emission reduction target.</p>
                        <p>These elements would provide a desirable margin of safety against harm to
                            the ozone layer while scientific research continues. At the same time,
                            this approach would provide as much certainty as possible for industrial
                            planning in order to minimize the costs of reducing reliance on these
                            chemicals, while allowing adequate time for adjustment.</p>
                        <p>The timing, stringency and scope of the phased reductions will have to be
                            negotiated. We would promote a scheme which allows <pb facs="1064"
                                n="1018" xml:id="pg_1018"/> flexibility for each nation to determine
                            how it will implement domestically its international obligation. In
                            reponse to <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>’s invitation, we have
                            prepared for discussion purposes the attached draft text for the
                            operative paragraphs of a protocol.</p>
                        <p>We would favor setting national limits at or near current levels, in
                            order to avoid increases in emissions from any Party. Elimination of
                            most emissions would obviate the difficult question of equity—the view
                            that developing countries have a right to a fair share of world markets
                            if a global limit on emissions is set: developing countries will have
                            less reason to seek to expand use of products which will be obsolete in
                            the forseeable future and they will benefit from the development of
                            substitutes and of recycling and containment techniques.</p>
                        <p>We will seek to include in the protocol measures to regulate relevant
                            trade between parties and non-parties in order to create incentives for
                            nations to adhere to the protocol’s emissions limits. These measures
                            will have an ancillary effect of protecting U.S. industry from unfair
                            competition. We will assure that any trade provisions included in the
                            protocol are consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
                                (<gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>) and other aspects of U.S.

                        <p>We have undertaken extensive consultations with industry and
                            environmental groups and will continue to do so as the negotiations

                        <p>1. Summary: First round of resumed negotiations by quote ad hoc group of
                            government-designated legal and technical experts for preparation of a
                            protocol on chlorofluorocarbons to the Vienna Convention for the
                            Protection of the Ozone Layer unquote concluded early Friday afternoon
                            (December 5). Representatives from all regional blocs agreed that new
                            measures must be taken in near-term to control emissions of ozone
                            depleting chemicals. However, while differences over the scope,
                            stringency and time-phasing of control measures were narrowed, they were
                            not resolved. Discussions helped clarify specifics and rationale of
                            various proposals; delineated issues related to control strategies,
                            trade aspects, and developing country participation that require further
                            analysis by the U.S. and others; established that Euro<pb facs="1067"

                            prepared to move beyond previously-held positions (although how far is
                            yet to be determined); and revealed unexpectedly strong developing
                            country support for a protocol and U.S. positions in general (albeit
                            from a sparse <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> turnout). Prospects
                            for next session heavily dependent upon European Communities’
                            willingness to consider control measures over long term, and <gloss

                                >UNEP</gloss> Deputy Executive Director William Mansfield set good
                            tone in opening statement which emphasized accumulating scientific
                            evidence of threat to global ecosystem, and the solid groundwork and
                            momentum which the past two years of international scientific meetings
                            and consultations had [illegible]. Mansfield’s quote rising tide in the

                            texts (by U.S. and Canada) available for distribution until second day,
                            and subsequent inability to produce translations of meeting room papers
                            quickly in all languages. (<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>

                        <p>4. Meeting was very useful in defining a common understanding of key
                            concerns and options on which an effective second session depends.
                            Several delegates expressed strong support for U.S. trade article.
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> proposal called for study only.
                            Informal discussions revealed broad interest in including trade
                            provision in protocol to provide necessary teeth and safeguards, and
                            also in examining the feasibility of having it include products which
                            contain or are made with controlled chemicals.</p>
                        <p>5. Developing Country Treatment—Nordic and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> proposals both exempted LDCs from contract provisions,
                            Soviets providing complete exemption while Nordics applying provisions
                            only to parties with per capita use above 8.2 kg. Canada indicated
                            support for exemption of any country with per capita use below world
                            average (0.16 kg.). <pb facs="1068" n="1022" xml:id="pg_1022"/>
                            Argentina argued strongly for a quote polluter pays approach unquote,
                            without elaborating. (Argentine Representive very helpful and supportive
                            of U.S. positions throughout, as was Egyptian delegate.)</p>

                            until March 20. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> further
                            complicated situation by saying that no further session should be held

                            strongly argued that February date (known to all parties for over a
                            year) should be maintained. Result was that working group referred the

                        <p>As short as I can make it, here’s where I see the ozone issue.</p>
                        <p>• Administration policy has been led by <gloss target="#t_EPA_1"
                                >EPA</gloss> and State, and I have serious doubts that what they’re
                            leading us to is either good politics or good policy.</p>
                        <p>• By asking for a 95% phase-down in CFCs at the Vienna talks, the U.S. is
                            going far beyond what most other countries want. Both the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> and Japan will have to be arm-twisted
                            just to get them to accept a freeze.</p>
                        <pb facs="1069" n="1023" xml:id="pg_1023"/>
                        <p>• Let’s assume we get only a freeze at Vienna or at one of the future
                            negotiating sessions. Then we are still under a court order to write <hi
                                rend="italic">domestic</hi> regulations.<note n="2" xml:id="d357fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d355">Document 355</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>• At that stage, we’re in trouble. If <gloss target="#t_EPA_1"
                                >EPA</gloss> doesn’t write stiff enough domestic regulations, then
                            both the Democrats in Congress and the environmentalists will bang us
                            over the head, citing <hi rend="italic">our own request for a
                                phase-down</hi> in Vienna as evidence that tough regulations
                            mandating a phase-down are necessary.</p>
                        <p>• On the other hand, if we mandate a phase-down ourselves, then we
                            penalize our own industry and raise pressure to ban the import of
                            products containing CFCs.</p>
                        <p>• The economic impact would be tremendous, since CFCs are ubiquitous.
                            And, at least so far, no one in the Administration has done a study of
                            just how much any kind of regulation would cost either <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> consumers or producers.</p>
                        <p>• A key issue, it seems to me, is whether the Administration has ever
                            decided that the science linking CFCs with ozone depletion justifies a
                            phase-down. The scientists themselves say they can’t tell how much
                            “insurance”—that is, <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> regulation—is
                            required. They say that’s a policy judgment, yet so far that policy
                            judgment is being made without any assessment of its costs.</p>
                        <p>• At this late stage, it may be impossible to change the Administration’s
                            negotiating position at the international talks. But one thing the
                                <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> might be able to do is to tell
                            our negotiating team to <hi rend="italic">accept a freeze</hi>. Right
                            now, <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> and the
                            negotiating team won’t do that, so they’re trying to raise the domestic
                            political pressure in Europe and Japan so the governments will support a
                            phase-down. In other words, the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> Administration finds itself in the unusual
                            position of being allied with Germany’s <persName corresp="#p_GGS_1"
                                >Green</persName> Party!</p>
                        <p>• In any case, this issue of freeze v. phase-down is important, and may
                            require <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> attention. Today’s Working
                            Group meeting was at least a start at trying to get some more sober
                            voices—Justice and Interior, in particular—into the policy process.</p>
                        <p>Hope this helps.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary—Second round of negotiations proceeding in workmanlike fashion
                            and, in US Del’s view, focusing on proper range of issues. In contrast
                            to first meeting in Geneva last December, <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1"
                                >UNEP</gloss> working group seems to accept as given need for longer
                            term strategy for control of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s and
                            other chemicals, and there is increased movement by key parties,
                            including <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, to accept some form of
                            scheduled reduction beyond first step freeze on production (or adjusted
                            production).</p>
                        <p>2. Session got off to good start Monday morning with strong statement by
                                <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> Deputy Executive Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCG_1">Mansfield</persName> stressing: urgency
                            of concluding protocol; <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>’s
                            disappointment with slow pace to date; the need for a broad scope
                            agreement to control chlorine (and bromine) emissions, not just certain
                            chemicals; and imperative of avoiding quote weak and ineffective
                            protocol unquote which would be to quote neglect our mandate unquote.
                            These themes echoed by subsequent speakers, including Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_LK_1">Lang</persName> (Austria) and U.S. Representative
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> in U.S. plenary
                            statement (septel).</p>
                        <p>3. Discussions moved quickly toward concentration on key issues posed by
                            Chairman as eight questions subsuming scope of chemical coverage, how to
                            expand list at later date, calculation of emissions, base figure for
                            initiating limitations/reductions, special situation of developing
                            countries, trade among parties, and between parties and non-parties,
                            long term strategies, and financial/administrative aspects. Following
                            several rounds of discussions (Monday p.m. and Tuesday a.m.),<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d358fn2">February 23 and February 24, respectively.</note>
                            plenary adjourned in favor of four specialized working groups
                            established by Chairman after consultation with selected delegation
                            heads, including U.S. working groups, each scheduled for two sessions
                            Tuesday and Wednesday, examining science issues (e.g., periodic
                            assessment mechanism); control strategy; developing country treatment;
                            and trade. (Note: US Del believes U.S. efforts prior to session with
                                <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> organizers to ensure such a
                            sharp focus, including use of working groups, proved very
                            influential.)</p>
                        <pb facs="1071" n="1025" xml:id="pg_1025"/>
                        <p>4. Attendance appears somewhat larger than Geneva session, with Kenya,
                            Nigeria, Thailand and Philippines joining list of Geneva attendees
                            (albeit essentially silent). Notable absences including China, India,
                            Spain, Greece, Portugal (and Australia). Japan represented (only) by
                            Geneva-based Representative and industry representative from Tokyo (who
                            has participated to only very limited extent).</p>
                        <p>5. On positive side, most delegations seem to accept need for broad scope
                            protocol that will at least designate certain chemicals (e.g. halons)
                            for study even if controlled chemicals are fewer in number. US Del
                            believes, however, that it will be possible to get agreement to go
                            beyond control (freeze) of only <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s
                            11 and 12. Particularly encouraging is Soviet willingness to discuss
                            quote other chemicals which need to be dealt with over longer term
                            unquote, given rigid posture in Geneva in opposition to discussing
                            anything beyond 11 and 12.</p>
                        <p>6. In addition, there is movement toward U.S. control scenario based on
                            scheduled reduction. While <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> continues
                            to be major stumbling block (and appears particularly dug in against
                            both U.S. preference for quote adjusted production unquote formula and
                            including halons in a protocol), the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                            submitted a discussion paper with new last paragraph publicly
                            acknowledging for the first time that quote some reduction (in <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s) could be a desirable precautionary
                            measure unquote.<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">Not further

                        <p>7. Regarding current status of two major working groups, Group on Control
                            Measures made very little progress in addressing the issues with which
                            it was charged. The majority of its time was spent in discussing
                            production vs. adjusted production (production minus exports to parties
                            plus imports minus amount destroyed). Canada and the Nordic countries
                            (as expected) joined the U.S. in supporting the adjusted production
                            formula while the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Australia, New
                            Zealand and Denmark also indicated support. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> held firm to the view that controlling
                            production (or production and imports, as separate quantities), was
                            simpler to implement and therefore more effective. Numerous delegations
                            pointed out that the adjusted produc<pb facs="1072" n="1026"
                                xml:id="pg_1026"/>tion was: (A) virtually as simple to implement;
                            (B) exactly equivalent environmentally; (C) and much more equitable than
                            using production (which would result in conferring monopoly rights to
                            current producers). By contrast, the sub-group on trade issues made
                            considerable progress. The group agreed to focus primarily on the
                            question of trade between parties and non-parties. It discussed and
                            concluded that any restrictions on imports from non-parties would likely

                        </list>
                        <p>At the CEEM Conference today, I had the chance to speak informally with
                            numerous American industrialists. While virtually all of them support
                            additional controls on <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s and the
                            concept of international (as opposed to unilateral) U.S. action, their
                            mood is one of serious distress and concern over the U.S. position <hi
                                rend="italic">and</hi> the process.</p>
                        <p>I was told that <persName corresp="#p_TLM_1">Lee Thomas</persName>, in
                            his keynote address yesterday, stressed that <gloss target="#t_EPA_1"
                                >EPA</gloss> would be guided by the international negotiating
                            result. There were, therefore, questions why the “State Department” was
                            pushing for a binding international treaty before the domestic agency
                            was in a position to justify regulations at home.</p>

                                >Shultz</persName> also reflects industry’s current mood.<note n="3"

                        <p>Some other points:</p>
                        <p>—Industry is strongly dissatisfied with the nature and extent of
                            consultation with <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>. Their contacts
                            are essentially limited to one individual (Hoffman), and they have been
                            rebuffed by <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> in their proposal for
                            fuller participation in the analytical and rulemaking process
                            (apparently in contrast to the case with other environmental
                            regulations). Dick Barnett (President of the <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss> Alliance) says he has been unable to get an appointment
                            with <persName corresp="#p_TLM_1">Lee Thomas</persName> and is ready to
                            see him at home on a Sunday.</p>
                        <p>—The Department of Commerce has the same complaint; in contrast with the
                            process preceding the aerosol ban in 1978, they have the feeling this is
                            a closed game, with <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> (i.e., Hoffman)
                            not open to full collaboration.</p>
                        <p>—There is great concern over the lack of analysis of costs and
                            consequences of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> reduction, and the
                            feeling that the figures may be in process of being “cooked” by <gloss
                                target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> without adequate industry
                            participation in the analytical process.</p>
                        <p>—They are particularly worried about the U.S. sticking to the “95%
                            phaseout” in our international position, for which there is neither full
                            scientific nor economic justification. We offered “up to 95%” as
                            “illustrative” in December and February.<note n="4" xml:id="d359fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d356">Documents 356</ref> and <ref target="#d358"
                                    >358</ref>.</note> At the April negotiation, I believe it
                            essential that we now show flexibility for a lower figure (<gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> has proposed 20% in 6 years). If not, we
                            risk totally losing industry support.</p>
                        <p>—In sum, much of industry seems to feel that low-level <gloss
                                target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> staff, in consort with <gloss
                                target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss>’s and some Congressional circles, are
                            manufacturing an atmosphere for an unreasonable and precipitate U.S.
                            action.</p>

                                position outlined in the Circular 175.</p>
                            <p>—State shares the view that the basic elements of a refined position
                                should be reviewed by the <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss>
                                before the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> signs on.</p>
                            <p>—Since the <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> review will not take
                                place until after next week’s round of negotiations, however, it is
                                essential that the delegation be allowed sufficient flexibility,
                                within the scope of the Circular 175, to maintain the momentum in
                                the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>—The U.S. has played a leading role in these negotiations, deflecting
                                proposals which would have seriously disadvantaged the U.S.</p>
                            <p>—It is unacceptable for us to switch to a passive mode at this round
                                and to refuse to address the central issue of the negotiation:
                                stringency and timing of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                                reductions.</p>
                            <p>—If we are perceived as obstructing the international agreement, it
                                would lead to court and legislative action for unilateral U.S.
                                controls which would both disadvantage U.S. industry and not

                            diplomatic conference in Montreal. Ad Hoc “Chairman’s Group”, aided by
                            hard-driving and effective leadership of <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1"
                                >UNEP</gloss> Executive Direct Tolba, made considerable progress in
                            narrowing differences on control stringency and timing. Based on his
                            discussions with smaller sub-group of this group, Tolba developed a
                            compromise control article text with stringency and timing levels
                            between that of initial (Dec. <pb facs="1078" n="1032" xml:id="pg_1032"

                            subsequent meeting of sub-group (see para. 11).</p>
                        <p>—Productive discussions within trade group resulted in proposal for
                            compromise production/consumption “formula” for defining what is to be
                            controlled. However, group was unable to resolve substantive differences
                            on control of trade between parties and non-parties. Similarly, no
                            agreement emerged on treatment of developing countries.</p>
                        <p>—Scientific group, drawing on results of recent <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1"
                                >UNEP</gloss>-sponsored meeting of scientists to compare
                            ozone-depletion under alternative control strategies, gave strong
                            support for the need for broad chemical coverage. The group also
                            confirmed that a freeze would not prevent long-term depletion,
                            strengthening the view that further reductions were necessary to
                            adequately protect the ozone layer.</p>
                        <p>—Session concluded with plans for further informal meetings in June and
                            July, a formal working group session September 8–11 and diplomatic

                        <p>3. Stringency and Timing: Chairman <persName corresp="#p_LK_1"
                                >Lang</persName>’s (Austria) group, which initially consisted of all
                            heads of delegations with advisors, was supplanted by a smaller ad hoc
                            group consisting only of heads of delegation for the U.S., <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                            Denmark, Belgium, and the Commission), Canada, Norway, <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and Japan. Tolba took over
                            chairmanship of this group on Wednesday, after <persName
                                corresp="#p_LK_1">Lang</persName> was unexpectedly called back to
                            Vienna. With the assistance of the smaller group, Tolba produced a
                            compromise text for use in subsequent negotiations. Text calls for:</p>
                        <p>—(A) A freeze at 1986 levels within two years of protocol’s entry into
                            force (<gloss target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss>) (Tolba strongly urged that
                            protocol be ratified by 1988, so that the freeze would take effect by
                            1990);</p>
                        <p>—(B) A 20 percent reduction within four years of <gloss target="#t_EIF_1"
                                >EIF</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>—(C) A further reduction of 30 percent, following a periodic
                            scientific/technical/economic review, for which two options were
                            provided: (1) within six years after entry into force if a majority of
                            the parties so decide; (2) within eight years after entry into force
                            unless two-thirds of the parties otherwise decide;</p>
                        <p>—(D) A future decision (based on scientific/technical/economic
                            assessment) regarding further actions, which could be put into effect
                                <pb facs="1079" n="1033" xml:id="pg_1033"/> by either a majority or
                            two-thirds vote of the parties (both alternatives still in
                            brackets).</p>
                        <p>—None of the delegations represented at Geneva gave formal assent to this
                            control package, with some (Canada, Nordics, Switzerland, New Zealand)
                            indicating that it might be “too weak”, and others (<gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Japan) that it might be “too strong”. U.S. stated that we would
                            carefully study the details, noting, inter alia, that text may need
                            further refinement to ensure proper synchronization between scientific
                            assessment and control decisions. Nevertheless, there was general
                            agreement among delegations that the text represents the closest to a
                            consensus yet attained on the contentious issue of control stringency
                            and timing.</p>
                        <p>4. Scope of Chemical Coverage: The chair’s group moved closer to
                            consensus on which chemicals to include for control. U.S., Canada, and
                            Nordics pushed for inclusion on <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 11,
                            12, 113, 114, 115, and halons 1211 and 1301 for at least the freeze,
                            perhaps with only 11, 12, and 113 included for subsequent reduction
                            phases. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>’s opening position was to
                            include only 11 and 12, but they subsequently added 113 and—while not
                            consenting—agreed to consider inclusion of others. By contrast, at the
                            outset of discussions, Japan actively opposed inclusion of 113. By end
                            of week, however, <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> Delegation had
                            agreed to take question back to Tokyo for reconsideration in light of
                            “broad consensus” at the meeting (important element for Japan was
                            agreement by other delegations to aggregated emissions, with each
                            chemical weighted by its ozone depletion potential). <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> still opposed including halons, due
                            to legal questions of whether inclusion is allowed by working group’s
                            formal mandate. However, Soviets appeared more sympathetic to the
                            scientific rationale for including halons, and Tolba agreed to seek
                            enlargement of the mandate at the <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>
                            Governing Council in June. Overall, movement toward U.S. position on the
                            issue was facilitated by conclusions of scientific group emphasizing
                            need for broad chemical coverage (see para. 9).</p>
                        <p>5. Further, it was agreed that the chemicals would be grouped together
                            and weighted according to their ozone-depletion potential (see para. 9).
                            This would enable individual countries to “trade off” freeze or
                            reductions among individual chemicals within the basket, so long as the
                            weighted total for the entire basket met the protocol freeze/reduction
                            target. This flexibility was critical in moving Japan to at least
                            consider inclusion of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 113.</p>
                        <p>6. Control Formula: The question of the control “formula” (i.e., whether
                            to freeze and reduce national production, adjusted production, or some
                            hybrid formulation) was taken up by the trade sub-group. U.S., Canada,
                            Nordics, and New Zealand supported adjusted production (<gloss
                                target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss>) formula (production imports—exports to
                            parties—amount <pb facs="1080" n="1034" xml:id="pg_1034"/> destroyed).
                            With main opposition to it coming from the <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>’s stated reasons for
                            opposing <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> formula were: (A) It would
                            be difficult to implement and enforce; (B) adequate data to calculate
                            base year level might not be available for many countries (they proposed
                            using 1990 for base year); (C) subtracting only exports to parties might
                            put the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> at a disadvantage, since they
                            could not ensure that their existing export market would become parties;
                            (D) subtracting exports might create an incentive for some parties to
                            maintain or increase production. Based on a Swedish proposal to combine
                            both approaches, Trade Group developed an ad referendum draft text,
                            which calls for initially freezing production and imports separately,
                            and then reducing both production and consumption in parallel (with the
                            latter defined as adjusted production but with all exports subtracted).
                            Parties would subsequently assess treatment of the export term (e.g.,
                            whether it would apply for exports to parties only). Text remains
                            bracketed, however, because Nordics, New Zealand, and some LDCs insisted
                            on a provision to allow non-producing countries to produce up to their
                            allocated level of imports, providing that imports are reduced by an
                            equal amount. Japan proposed a second alternative allowing for
                            inter-party transfer of production capacity, providing that total global
                            production does not increase. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> opposed
                            both proposals. Beyond these substantive differences, full consensus on
                            this compromise formulation was not reached, because many delegations
                            expressed need to assess implications of compromise formula in more
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>—In addition, the trade group agreed that the protocol should provide
                            credit to a party for the amount of the controlled substances destroyed,
                            provided that destruction is by techniques approved by the parties. This
                            preserved U.S. interest in creating an incentive for the development of
                                <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> destruction technologies, while
                            allaying prior <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> concern that the
                            amounts reported for some countries might not be reliable until the
                            technologies are known and widely accepted.</p>
                        <p>7. Trade between parties and non-parties: <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> insistence that <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            representative be present before Trade Group could take up discussions
                            of trade article prevented Trade Group from devoting adequate time for
                            discussion of trade article. However, this tactic backfired somewhat
                            when <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> legal advisor appeared and
                            (contrary to expectations of <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Reps) stated that in his opinion
                            non-party import restrictions would be supportable under Article 20 of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d362fn4"
                                >Article 20 of the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> provides
                                exceptions to the restriction of trade in order to protect a variety
                                of causes, including environmental ones.</note> (although final
                            determination would be by <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            members). When Trade Group <pb facs="1081" n="1035" xml:id="pg_1035"/>
                            took up consideration of substantive elements of trade article, it
                            became clear that the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Commission (at
                            least at the staff level) and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> are
                            opposed to any restrictions (export or import) except for bulk
                            chemicals. Their ostensive reasons were: (A) increased possibility of
                            being challenged within the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>, and
                            (B) possible conflict with bilateral trade agreements. Other than
                            Canada, which supported U.S. out of principle, other participants were
                            non-committal on trade issue. Other than agreement to remove exemption
                            for non-party compliance (which was replaced with a more restrictive
                            provision for developing countries) result was little movement since
                            last meeting, a heavily bracketed text, with substantial differences in
                            positions of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, and positions
                            of other key players as yet unarticulated.</p>
                        <p>8. Developing Countries: Very little time was spent on the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> issue, despite somewhat greater number
                            of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> representatives present and more
                            vocal participation. Only substantive proposal, by Canada (and amended
                            by others), would exempt parties with per capita consumption less than
                            0.1–.0.2 kg/yr from the controls for the first 5–10 years of the
                            protocol, after which they be subject to the controls in a manner
                            “parallel” to other parties. Although there appeared to be sentiment for
                            Canadian approach of only allowing LDCs to be exempted for a period of
                            years (rather than indefinitely), group concluded that Canadian
                            proposal, as well as proposals from previous sessions, be assessed
                            further prior to next negotiating session. Lack of data on current
                            levels of developing country consumption continues to hamper resolution
                            of this issue.</p>
                        <p>9. Scientific Group: Scientific group issued very strong report which
                            supported <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> positions on: (A) the
                            need for broad chemical coverage of all fully-halogenated compounds, and
                            (B) the need for reduction steps beyond a freeze. Latter point was
                            buttressed by the group’s high-lighting the importance of potential
                            changes in the vertical distribution of ozone and latitudinal gradients
                            in estimates of total column ozone depletion. Group also agreed on ozone
                            depletion potential values for all of the chemicals under discussion,
                            which were recommended for use in the protocol for calculating weighted
                            emissions. In addition, scientific group reaffirmed need for major
                            scientific assessment every four years, and the need to develop an
                            improved ground-based stratospheric monitoring system.</p>
                        <p>10. Future Work: Canada confirmed that the diplomatic conference will be
                            held in Montreal September 14–16, to be preceeded by a fourth working
                            group session September 8–11. Prior to that, two informal meetings have
                            been scheduled. The Chair’s Group will meet June 29–30 in Brussels and a
                            legal drafting group will meet July 6–8 in The <pb facs="1082" n="1036"

                            maximize the likelihood of an outcome favorable to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> objectives (specific guidance will
                            follow for relelvant posts);</p>
                        <p>—(B) Timing of control article steps should be reviewed to ensure that
                            they are properly synchronized with the periodic scientific
                            assessments;</p>
                        <p>—(C) The relevant <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies assess
                            the compromise control “formula” developed by the trade group, to see
                            whether it protects U.S. interests, whether it is feasible from a
                            domestic regulatory standpoint (including the question of data
                            availabiltiy), and whether there are any simpler alternatives which
                            accomplish the same thing;</p>
                        <p>—(D) Consideration be given to how the remaining substantive areas for
                            which consensus has not been reached (e.g., non-party trade, LDCs) might
                            be moved toward resolution prior to the September working group session;
                            in particular, whether it would be useful to gauge the interest of other
                            countries in: (1) an additional informal meeting to discuss trade
                            issues, and (2) informal discussions of the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"

                        <p>The Attorney General opened the meeting by introducing Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> who gave an overview of the
                            events leading to the current round of international negotiations<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">See <ref target="#d362">Document
                                362</ref>.</note> to cut back on the production of compounds that
                            appear to reduce the stratospheric ozone layer. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> pointed out that the
                            negotiations on stratospheric ozone began in 1982 under the Vienna
                                Convention,<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3">See <ref target="#d349"
                                    >Document 349</ref>.</note> and that procedures were established
                            to develop a protocol for a worldwide reduction of chlorofluorocarbons
                            (CFCs) and other compounds that deplete the ozone layer. That protocol
                            should be presented to the Senate for ratification sometime during the
                            Fall of 1987. He also mentioned the hole in the ozone layer over
                            Antarctica discovered by the British in 1985 as giving impetus to the
                            negotiations, and said the Environmental Protection Agency is required
                            under court order to determine ways in which the domestic production of
                                <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s can be regulated. During the
                            Spring of 1987, the U.S. negotiating team has met several times with
                            representatives of member countries and are now ready to complete the
                            draft protocol in preparation for a meeting in September 1987 when
                            participating countries would sign it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> asked Mr. Watson to
                            outline scientific knowledge about the ozone depletion problem. Mr.
                            Watson described the problem, including the weaknesses and disagreements
                            in the current scientific models being used. Messrs. Graham, Fletcher,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName>, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> discussed the nature
                            of the science on ozone depletion and whether it was caused by a natural
                            phenomena or man made chemicals. No conclusions were reached. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> discussed the areas
                            in which Council guidance was being sought to develop a U.S. position on
                            the protocol. They included chemical coverage, stringency and timing, a
                            control formula and trade provisions, and participation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName>
                            <pb facs="1084" n="1038" xml:id="pg_1038"/> said that the delegation is
                            attempting to reach the broadest possible involvement of as many nations
                            as possible, pointing out that the European Communities, Japan and
                            Russia, have resisted controls but are now coming closer to the U.S.
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> said that there may be
                            other ways to control <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>’s and
                            suggested that the Germans be asked to ban aerosol products as the U.S.
                            has done. He also suggested that we look closely at how countries vote
                            on sanctions if other nations do not comply with the protocol agreement.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> stated that the issue
                            of weighted voting is still to be negotiated. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> stated that compliance with the
                            protocol should be monitored and not left to an “honor system.” Mr.
                            Graham stated that the science was very uncertain, and that the effect
                            of ultraviolet light on humans is controllable. He said that scientists
                            should continue to measure the true depletion of ozone before agreeing
                            to a required reduction of ozone depleting chemicals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> stated that if the
                            objective of an international agreement is to reduce ozone, there are
                            several ways to reach that objective. He suggested that we seek the
                            broadest possible participation, including the U.S./E.C./Japan/<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss> producing nations. Others could cut back aerosols as we
                            have done, then follow with a freeze if necessary. If our objective is
                            to protect the health of the people, then the Working Group should look
                            at ways to protect public health rather than controlling ozone depleting
                            chemicals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Wallis</persName> stated
                            that when science and technology conflicts with politics, we have
                            problems. He agreed we are facing pressure from lobby groups and from
                            Congress to control the chemicals that deplete the ozone layer, and said
                            we should end up with the position being taken by the negotiating team.
                            He felt we should support weighted voting based on <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> production. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> explained that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> is mandated by the Clean Air Act to
                            issue domestic regulations to control ozone depleting chemicals, thus we
                            may be forced to take unilateral action if we do not get participation
                            in an international protocol. Mr. Sprinkel said the costs and benefits
                            of a protocol should be investigated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWHI_1"
                                >Taft</persName> expressed concern about the inclusion of halons in
                            the protocol because of extensive Defense Department use. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> summarized the issues that
                            should be addressed by the Working Group and brought to the Council at
                            another meeting, including the science of ozone depletion, a
                            cost/benefit analysis, how halons should be treated, and what court and
                            legislative actions are pending.</p>

                            strong support for the current U.S. position in the international

                            Environment Programme, an international accord on protection of the

                            priority on the global environmental agenda. Due mainly to efforts by

                            their positions and followed the U.S. lead in considering a freeze in
                            production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), followed by significant
                            reductions. A Conference of Plenipotentiaries is scheduled for
                            mid-September in Montreal to complete the negotiation and sign the
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. position in this negotiation was developed through intensive
                            interagency deliberations (which included the Justice Department)
                            leading up to, and following, the approval by <persName

                            required to do so before further reductions are scheduled. The US in

                            the grounds that, even with the aerosol ban, US per capita use of CFCs

                            environmental risks while providing a market stimulus and a reasonable
                            time-frame for industry to develop alternative products. We believe that

                            well, and could cause needless embarrassment to the Administration on an

                            interest groups. We therefore propose that you write directly to

                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear Ed:</p>
                            <p>I wanted you to know of my strong personal interest in the early and
                                successful completion of an effective international treaty to
                                protect the stratospheric ozone layer through reducing use of
                                certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. This is a subject
                                which has attracted intense Congressional and media interest, and
                                which many regard as the highest priority environmental issue on the
                                global agenda.</p>
                            <p>International agreement is now within reach, largely on U.S. terms.
                                The U.S. position was developed through intensive interagency
                                deliberations leading up to, and following, the authority to
                                negotiate (Circular 175) which was approved on my behalf by Under
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Allen Wallis</persName> last
                                November. Implementing that authority, the U.S. delegation has
                                succeeded through three difficult negotiating rounds in turning
                                aside control proposals which would have been disadvantageous to the
                                United States, and in gaining wide acceptance of the U.S.
                                position.</p>
                            <p>I am now concerned, however, that within the Domestic Policy Council
                                process, a few agencies are advocating positions which would, in
                                effect, reopen the entire international negotiation, which is
                                scheduled for completion in September at a Conference of
                                Plenipotentiaries in Montreal.</p>
                            <p>I understand, and sympathize with, concerns over both scientific
                                uncertainties and the possible economic impact of controls. However,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TLM_1">Lee Thomas</persName>, who is
                                charged with environmental protection by the President as well as by
                                legislative mandate, has concluded, after over two years of
                                analysis, that the U.S. position is a prudent approach to risk
                                management. I agree with him. Although scientific certitude is
                                probably unattainable, I am impressed by the growing international
                                consensus on the threat to the ozone layer, largely due to research
                                by our own <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss>. This consensus is manifest in
                                the changed positions of both U.S. industry, which now officially
                                advocates at least a global freeze on production of CFCs, and the
                                European Community, which has proposed a freeze followed by a 20
                                percent automatic reduc<pb facs="1088" n="1042" xml:id="pg_1042"
                                />tion, and which last month agreed to consider a further 30 percent
                                    reduction.<note n="8" xml:id="d364fn8">See <ref target="#d362"
                                        >Document 362</ref>.</note></p>
                            <p>Based on contacts with industry, it appears that the 20 percent
                                reduction (which would not come into effect until 1992–94) could be
                                absorbed by U.S. industry utilizing existing alternative products
                                and processes. While the additional 30 percent cut would require
                                substitute products, the additional time frame for such reduction (8
                                to 12 years from now) would be within the “comfort zone” for the
                                market system to provide incentives for the needed R &amp; D.</p>
                            <p>I believe it would be inadvisable for us to delay the negotiations,
                                or to appear now less concerned over protecting the ozone layer than
                                the European Community and others who have followed our leadership.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TLM_1">Lee Thomas</persName> and I,
                                American Ambassadors abroad, and senior officials on my staff, have
                                all advocated the U.S. position in contacts with senior foreign
                                officials. This has contributed to the evolution of policy in many
                                countries. A perceived reversal by the U.S. risks an embarrassing
                                loss of international credibility, as well as domestic political
                                backlash. Moreover, it would risk the worst possible outcome from
                                the standpoint of U.S. industry and consumers: namely, unilateral
                                U.S. controls (added to our 1978 ban on CFCs for aerosol use) forced
                                by the Clean Air Act, by court order, or by new legislation. There
                                are already growing rumors in Congress and among public interest
                                groups that the Administration is “backsliding” from its previously
                                much-praised commitment to protect the ozone layer.</p>
                            <p>In order not to jeopardize the progress we have made in this major
                                international negotiation, and following consultation with <persName

                                the U.S. Representative to continue to negotiate in conformance with
                                the existing Circular 175 authority. The objective is a strong and
                                effective international agreement by September, containing
                                provisions as summarized in the enclosure, which is consistent with

                            <p>I hope you will agree that this is a reasonable position. Only a

                                environmental risks, avert needless criticism of the Administration
                                and probable unilateral domestic controls, and provide the needed
                                stimulus for industrial research into alternative products over a
                                reasonable time period. The Administration will have the opportunity
                                to review the negotiated protocol text before signature by our
                                Government. If you have any questions concerning these provisions,

                        <p>Thank you for your letter of 1 June 1987<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">See
                                Tab A, <ref target="#d364">Document 364</ref>.</note> concerning the
                            international negotiations to protect the stratospheric ozone layer,
                            currently under consideration within the Domestic Policy Council. I
                            appreciate the progress that has been made by State Department and the
                            Environmental Protection Agency in addressing this issue and negotiating
                            toward an international agreement, and I understand your concerns about
                            delay in the negotiations or dramatic change in the United States’
                            negotiating position.</p>
                        <p>I believe we can accommodate necessary progress in the negotiations and
                            also pursue on an accelerated basis the process now underway within the
                            Domestic Policy Council, which will present this issue to the President
                            in an expeditious and fair manner. As a result of the first Domestic

                        <p>The process now in place will allow the President to make the necessary

                        <p>Through three tough, and well-publicized, negotiating rounds under United
                            Nations Environment Programme (<gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>)
                            auspices since last December, participating countries have moved toward
                            consensus on a schedule for reducing emissions of ozone-depleting
                            chemicals. The issues are complex and interrelated (see May 18 <gloss

                            point of division is the extent of reductions which the U.S. should
                            support, and whether the reductions should be scheduled as
                            “semi-automatic” (i.e., reversible by vote of parties) or only
                            implemented upon a future reaffirmation by parties—in both cases
                            preceded by a scientific, economic, and technological assessment.</p>
                        <p>The debate centers on whether the U.S. should support the “Chairman’s

                            other issues, such as mandatory requirements for “verification” of

                            sufficiently significant that we should not make these points absolute

                        <p>On May 20, 1987, the Council met to discuss the international protocol
                            negotiations currently underway to limit emissions of ozone depleting
                            chemicals. Several questions were raised and the Working Group was asked
                            to provide answers. The questions were:</p>
                        <p>• What are the legislative and legal impacts of an international ozone
                            protocol?</p>
                        <p>• What are the most up-to-date scientific data on climatic and health
                            effects of ozone depletion?</p>
                        <p>• What is the cost/benefit effect of an international protocol
                            restricting ozone depleting chemicals?</p>
                        <p>The following has been summarized by the Working Group after discussion
                            of detailed presentations by experts in each area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Climatic and Atmospheric</p>
                        <p>• Since 1960 the natural variability of the total global column of ozone
                            has been about 3%.</p>
                        <p>• Observations have shown (1) a decrease in ozone of about 7% during the
                            last decade in the upper part of the stratosphere; and (2) a 40%
                            decrease in total column ozone over Antarctica in the spring season
                            since the mid-1970’s. Whether the recent changes in column and upper
                            stratospheric ozone are due to natural phenomena or in part to CFCs
                            remains an open question.</p>
                        <p>• Continued growth of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> and Halon
                            emissions at 3% per year is predicted to yield a globally averaged ozone
                            depletion of 6% by the year 2040, and more thereafter, which would be
                            greater than natural variability. In contrast, a true global freeze on
                            emissions of CFCs and Halons (i.e. full international participation,
                            full chemical coverage, and full compliance) is predicted to yield a
                            maximum global average column ozone depletion of less than 1%. Ozone
                            depletions at high latitudes are predicted to be 2–3 times larger than
                            the global average.</p>

                        <p>• A true global freeze would limit column ozone depletion to less than
                            the natural variability. A protocol freeze would fall short of a true
                            global freeze as it would have less than full compliance among developed
                            countries and would most likely allow for limited growth in <gloss

                        <p>• Ozone depletion in the upper part of the stratosphere greater than 25%
                            is predicted to occur even in the case of a true global freeze. This
                            would lead to a local cooling greater than natural variability. The
                            consequences of this cooling for the earth’s climate cannot be predicted
                            at this time.</p>
                        <p>• There is an uncertainty factor of two to three in the predictive
                            abilities of the theoretical models used to simulate the present
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>• If there is environmental damage due to CFCs and Halons, their long
                            atmospheric lifetimes would mean that recovery would take many decades
                            even after complete cessation of emissions.</p>

                        <p>—The economic benefits from a protocol freeze (at 1986 levels with less
                            than full international participation) of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss> emissions are substantially greater than the costs over
                            all plausible assumptions and ranges of uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>—The economic benefits of a protocol freeze plus a 20% reduction in
                                <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> emissions are also in almost
                            all cases substantially in excess of the costs.</p>
                        <p>—The incremental benefits of the additional 20% reduction beyond the
                            freeze are in most cases in excess of the incremental costs of the
                            cut.</p>
                        <p>—The benefits of an additional 30% reduction (beyond the freeze plus 20%
                            reduction) appear in some cases to be greater than the incremental
                            costs, and in other cases to be less. Further scientific, technical, and
                            economic review will be valuable in evaluating benefits and costs before

                            negotiations was provided. It included a review of the November 28, 1986
                            Circular 175, which was approved by Under Secretary of State <persName

                                process for the Circular 175 has been criticized by some members of
                                the Working Group, on the basis that numerous departments and
                                agencies had not concurred on the Circular, or that concurrence was
                                by individuals not at policy-making levels</hi>. The Circular 175
                            authorized the U.S. delegation to negotiate a protocol providing

                        <p>III. Periodic review of the protocol provisions based upon regular

                            change the schedule or the emission reduction target.</p>
                        <p>The international negotiations to date have resulted in a Chairman’s
                            Text, a proposed protocol to which negotiating countries have been asked

                                The Working Group also recommends however, that additional guidance
                                be given to the U.S. negotiators, based on reviews by a wider range

                                seek maximum international participation in the protocol</hi>. To
                            many, participation is the key issue, because growth of emissions from
                            non-participating countries would offset the emissions reductions of
                            those who are parties to the protocol, thereby hindering overall
                            attainment of protocol objectives.</p>
                        <p>Developing countries are an important part of the participation issue.
                            While the 48 countries participating in the protocol negotiations
                            account for over 90% of the current production, substantial growth of
                            production and consumption is anticipated in developing countries. The
                            U.S. and the United Nations Environment Program (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss>) have expended considerable effort
                            to encourage broad participation by developing countries. However, only
                            relatively few have shown the interest or the expertise to participate.
                            Parties to the protocol would not be able to prevent non-joining
                            countries from producing CFCs for their internal market or from
                            exporting to other non-parties, but, if the protocol provides for trade
                            sanctions, parties could prevent non-parties from profiting through
                            international trade with protocol parties.</p>
                        <p>A strong protocol, including the major producing and consuming countries,
                            should lead to earlier development of substitute products, <pb

                            to the protocol. Further, some believe that the very existence of a

                            increases the pressure on non-member countries to join; in essence, if
                            they continue to produce CFCs, they are exposed as behaving
                            irresponsibly on a matter of global import.</p>

                            allowed in recognition of the importance of having global participation
                            in the 21st century, and in recognition of the fact that developing
                            countries have not received the benefits of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"

                            Working Group discussed these at length.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A Freeze on Emissions</hi>. The following are major
                            questions:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">What chemicals should the freeze cover?</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chairman’s Text provides for a freeze on emissions at 1986 levels
                            which would cover CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114, and 115. Due to a technicality,
                            Halons are not now included.<note n="5" xml:id="d368fn5">An unknown hand
                                circled “113” and underlined the phrase “Halons are not now
                                included.”</note></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Working Group consensus is that the freeze should
                                include all of these CFCs as well as Halons 1201 and 1311</hi>. The
                            U.S. delegation will be seeking to expand the protocol to include the
                            Halons.</p>
                        <p>From a purely scientific perspective all chemicals containing chlorine
                            and bromine, weighted by the ozone depleting potential, should be
                            considered for the protocol, both for the freeze and for potential
                            future reductions. The Chairman’s Text is somewhat less than a purely
                            scientific perspective because only the fully halogenated chemicals
                            (CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, and Halons 1201 and 1311) are being
                            considered for inclusion. Chemicals such as <gloss target="#t_CFC_1"
                                >CFC</gloss> 22 and methyl chloroform which are only partially
                            halogenated are not being considered as they are believed to be part of
                            the solution and have relatively low ozone depleting potential.</p>
                        <p>Concern has been raised with regards to reductions in Halons 1201 and
                            1311 and <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 113 because of their
                            strategic value to the U.S., and the apparent lack of suitable
                            substitutes. This is a legitimate concern but one that can be handled if
                            controls are on the sum of the ozone depleting potential of all
                            chemicals, rather than on individual substances. This will allow each
                            individual country the flexibility to live <pb facs="1103" n="1057"

                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">When should a freeze on emissions occur?</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chairman’s Text proposes that the freeze take effect within two years
                            of entry into force. There is uncertainty as to when entry into force
                            will occur, but the best estimate is that it will be in the 1988–90 time
                            period. <hi rend="italic">The Working Group consensus is that a freeze
                                on emissions should go into effect within one to two years after

                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">What chemicals should the reductions cover?</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chairman’s Text proposes that the additional reductions beyond a
                            freeze include CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Working Group consensus is that any additional reductions should
                                cover CFCs 11 and 12; however, there are questions about the
                                coverage of CFCs 113, 114, 115, and Halons 1201 and 1311.</hi>
                            National security concerns argue against including the Halons in any
                            reductions. There is also a national defense and security concern with
                            including <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 113 in any reductions
                            beyond a freeze, especially given 113’s importance for certain
                            high-technology electrical applications. The questions regarding
                            coverage of CFCs 114 and 115 concern their potential use as substitutes
                            for controlled chemicals and their present low usage.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">How much and when?</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chairman’s Text provides for a 20% reduction to take effect 4 years
                            after entry into force (1992–94) and an additional 30% reduction to take
                            effect either 6 years (1994–96) or 8 years (1996–98) after entry into
                            force.</p>
                        <p>With respect to any future reductions, the Working Group recognizes the
                            importance of the future assessments of science, technology, economics
                            and environment.</p>
                        <p>The Working Group identified distinct issues surrounding each potential
                            reduction. With respect to the 20% reduction, some favor it because it
                            can be accomplished with existing industrial processes and because
                            reductions beyond a freeze may be needed to counterbalance less than
                            full participation in a freeze. Yet others note there are uncertainties
                            as to the need for any additional reductions.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the additional 30% reduction, some favor its inclusion on the
                            basis of judgments about the science and potential adverse health
                            effects. Others emphasize, however, the uncertainties about the need to
                            commit at this time to this additional measure. One or more scientific
                            reviews would be available prior to this reduction going into
                            effect.</p>

                        <p>The Chairman’s Text proposes an initial 20% reduction to take effect

                        <p>The Text provides two alternative implementing mechanisms for the next
                            30% reduction—6 years after entry into force if the majority of the
                            parties so decide, or 8 years after entry into force unless reversed by
                            a two-third majority of the parties.</p>
                        <p>There are strong views in the Working Group on the implementing mechanism
                            for the additional 30% percent reduction. Many do not wish to commit to
                            the reduction at this time unless it is contingent upon a positive vote
                            of a majority of the parties. Others, however, believe the evidence
                            warrants committing to this reduction at this time.</p>
                        <p>Most believe the future assessments of the science, technology, economics
                            and environment are important to these reduction decisions. There are
                            differing views, however, on how such future assessments ought to factor
                            into reduction decisions. Some believe final reduction decisions ought
                            to follow future assessments, whereas others believe reductions should
                            be scheduled now with an opportunity for reversal based upon future

                        <p>The Working Group identified several related issues that will require
                            further consideration. They include:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The relationship between international protocol and
                                domestic regulations</hi>. Since the overall objective of the
                            protocol is to avoid or reduce health and environmental risks,
                            compliance with the international protocol will necessarily result in
                            domestic regulation. There is legal precedent for such a linkage between
                            international agreements and subsequent domestic regulations.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Non-Regulatory Approaches</hi>. There is no reason
                            why the Nation’s efforts to achieve the objectives sought in the
                            protocol should be limited to a regulatory approach. The suggestion has
                            been made that if the government imposes such regulatory burdens upon
                            the people and the economy of the U.S., consideration should also be
                            given to policies which may ease the regulatory burdens, including, but
                            not limited to, <pb facs="1105" n="1059" xml:id="pg_1059"/> possibly
                            rendering unnecessary imposition of regulations beyond those necessary
                            to assure U.S. compliance with the international protocol.</p>
                        <p>Such a domestic, non-regulatory supplement to the international protocol
                            might, for example, contain elements intended to eliminate government
                            barriers to, or facilitate, the development of: substitutes for covered
                            chemicals, technology to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects of
                            chemical emissions upon stratospheric ozone, or medical advancements in
                            the understanding and treatment of the problems caused by ozone
                            depletion.</p>

                        <p>Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> began the
                            meeting by stating that guidance should be given to U.S. negotiators on
                            the positions to be supported during the final stages of negotiation of
                            an international protocol for protecting the stratospheric ozone layer.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> provided an overview
                            of questions raised at the last Council meeting about environmental and
                            health effects, legal and legislative issues, and cost-benefit data. He
                            said that while there is not total agreement on the validity of the
                            models being used, ozone depletion is occurring, and a freeze or <pb
                                facs="1106" n="1060" xml:id="pg_1060"/> reductions of chemicals that
                            seem to be causing the depletion would help prevent further ozone
                            depletion. He described the amounts of depletion reduction projected by
                            the models, including additional skin cancer deaths, more cataracts, and
                            other effects whose magnitudes are uncertain. He described Section 157
                            of the Clean Air Act which requires him to take action if further ozone
                            depletion may be reasonably anticipated, pointing out that the current
                            international negotiations have caused Congress to ease their pressure
                            for domestic regulations at this time. He said domestic action will be
                            necessary at some later time, possibly near the end of the year. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said he supports
                            agreeing to a 50% reduction from 1986 levels of production of
                            ozone-depleting chemicals, and that it is important to have an
                            international agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sprinkel described a cost/benefit analysis done by a subgroup of the
                            Energy, Natural Resources and Environment Working Group.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d369fn2">Probable reference to <ref target="#d368">Document
                                    368</ref>.</note> He said the costs are relatively
                            straightforward, and that simply put, we can look at emissions
                            reductions as an insurance policy with a specified rate of return. He
                            said the bottom line, despite some uncertainty, is that a freeze will
                            result in far greater benefits than costs; a further reduction of 20%
                            will result in somewhat greater benefits than costs; and a 30% reduction
                            beyond that could have marginal benefits over costs, but we need better
                            data to substantiate this. He recommended increasing the budget for
                            measuring other effects of ozone depletion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bauer felt the analyses are helpful, but questioned the numbers used
                            to represent values of life. Mr. Graham said the models for projecting
                            future effects extend up to 200 years, and do not assume likely changes
                            in skin care protection and other areas. He felt we should not make a
                            commitment to reductions until we have an unbiased scientific review. He
                            also opposed instructing the U.S. delegation to commit to a voting
                            scheme which may require actions not backed by science. Mr. Sprinkel
                            suggested that if we wait too long, international and congressional
                            actions will have passed us by. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1"
                                >Whitehead</persName> said his impression was that the scientific
                            community is concerned about depletion of the ozone layer and is
                            supporting freeze and reduction actions. Mr. Graham said that we must
                            accelerate development of knowledge about this situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCJB_1">Brown</persName> agreed that we have some time
                            before action must be taken, but he felt we must bring all countries
                            along in a cooperative approach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> said it is important
                            how we handle the scientific aspects of this issue, but even more
                            important how we handle the political situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said we know enough from the
                            science to negoti<pb facs="1107" n="1061" xml:id="pg_1061"/>ate a
                            protocol, and that through our actions we have brought other countries
                            to the negotiating table. He felt we should not wait, since we are close
                            to reaching reasonable agreements. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> commented on how facts about
                            stratospheric ozone are changed, citing as an example the National
                            Institutes of Health statement that cataracts will not be
                                increased.<note n="3" xml:id="d369fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> He felt we should present the President with the
                            best options possible, so that the President can instruct the U.S.
                            negotiators on what reductions to seek, what chemicals should be
                            covered, what countries must join in, and other features of the
                            protocol. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1">Whitehead</persName> said
                            that thus far the Administration can be proud of what we have done, and
                            that we must continue to take action in concert with other countries. He
                            said he would like pressure on the negotiators to get more countries
                            involved in the process. He said the U.S. is being asked about its
                            position on many of the features of the protocol.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> said he would like the
                            President to affirm that he wants an agreement, and one that will work.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> expressed fear that we
                            may sign an agreement and other countries will not. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> agreed that the President
                            should provide guidance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJR_2"
                                >Wright</persName> said it is important to give the President the
                            options now, so that negotiators will have guidance for the next rounds
                            of negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWHI_1">Taft</persName> did
                            not want the negotiators to pin down agreements on Halons, or possibly
                                <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> 113 chemicals yet. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> felt exclusions of
                            113s would be a problem at this late time. Ms. Schafer said that the
                            principle we should follow is that any reductions beyond a freeze must

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> summarized the
                            consensus of the Council that the U.S. negotiators should be given
                            guidance from the President. He directed that a series of options for
                            the President be developed by a small group of principals, and that they
                            be routed for comment by other Council members. The options would be
                            forwarded to the President and, if there are disagreements, a meeting
                            would be scheduled. Options would address country participation,
                            chemical coverage, voting, monitoring, and other issues regarding the
                            protocol.</p>

                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1"
                                >Hodel</persName> to review the stratospheric ozone issue. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> described negotiations
                            underway for developing an international protocol to protect the
                            stratospheric ozone layer. He said the purpose of the meeting is to
                            permit the President to consider guidance he may wish to give the U.S.
                            delegation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> presented
                            an overview of problems with depletion of the ozone layer, describing
                            models that have been developed for projecting results of different
                            courses of action. He discussed possible health effects such as
                            increased numbers of skin cancer deaths and cataracts, and other effects
                            on the ecology, agriculture production, and marine life. He outlined the
                            legal and legislative issues involved, and briefly reviewed costs and
                            benefits of various options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> described projections
                            from <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> models of a freeze on further
                            emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals by all or some number of
                            countries. He also commented on possible impacts of a reduction of 20%,
                            and an additional 30% reduction from 1986 production levels. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said that the 1977
                            Clean Air Act requires him to take action if a reasonable likelihood of
                            damage to the environment from stratospheric ozone depletion is present.
                            He said that in 1978, the U.S. banned aerosols partly out of this
                            concern. <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss> is now under a consent
                            decree pending the outcomes of the international negotiations, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said Congress and
                            environmental groups will be watching to see if the accord reached is
                            strong enough. He said that <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>
                            supports planned reductions of 50% of 1986 levels over ten years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> recapped the ozone
                            depletion problems as described by the various models. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJC_1">Whitehead</persName> said he felt the Council
                            members have agreed on the end results being sought, but that a dispute
                            exists over the means for getting there. He believed the outcome will be
                            a major victory in reducing destruction of the ozone layer, and said the
                                <pb facs="1109" n="1063" xml:id="pg_1063"/> negotiators should be
                            left free to get the best possible agreement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJR_2">Wright</persName> said the President’s
                            instructions to the U.S. delegation should be confidential, and treated
                            accordingly. Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>
                            agreed, pointing out that it is important that the President have the
                            benefit of the Council’s thinking, but that the discussion should be
                            tightly held while the negotiations are in progress. Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2"
                                >Thomas</persName> agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1"
                                >Hodel</persName> expressed concerns about limited participation in
                            the international negotiations thus far, and about the shortcomings in
                            the models, which in some cases extend to the year 2165. He felt that as
                            a result of these, we must reach agreement on how to address the overall
                            problems. The President asked how convinced we are about the overall
                            problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> described
                            the scientific processes that led to our current understanding of
                            potential effects of ozone depletion, including reference to the “hole”
                            in the ozone layer over the Antarctic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> reviewed the
                            negotiating issues and options developed by the Council. He recapped
                            questions about participation and entry into force of a protocol, a
                            grace period for lesser developed countries, a system of voting for
                            decisions, and monitoring, reporting and enforcement of the protocol.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJR_2">Wright</persName> said we should avoid
                            permitting lesser developed countries to use this issue against our
                            industries. The President asked what products we would be eliminating.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> described the
                            chemicals, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that are depleting the
                            ozone layer, and said we would be seeking substitutes that perform the
                            same functions but which do not cause ozone depletion. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> reviewed several issues
                            pertaining to a freeze and future reductions in production of these
                            chemicals. He also described the issue of whether the U.S. should
                            receive credits for its previous actions, such as the banning of
                            aerosols in 1978. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName>
                            said the U.S. position had been to seek credits, but because of the
                            directions of world opinion, we have decided to focus on proposing
                            reductions and not to debate who has caused the ozone layer
                            depletion.</p>
                        <p>Another issue was whether there should be trade provisions in the
                            protocol. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said
                            restrictions on imports are key to this issue. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> felt we should decide trade
                            restrictions on the merits of each case, rather than seek automatic
                            restrictions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SSB_1">Smart</persName> agreed,
                            pointing out that we should seek a flexible response. Discussion ensued
                            about trade problems that might evolve, especially pertaining to
                            development of substitutes. There was general agreement that we should
                            ban imports from countries that do not sign the protocol. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJA_1">Baker</persName> said we must develop
                            competitive substitutes so as to have leverage.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about producing ozone. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH_2">Thomas</persName> said there is too much in the
                            lower atmosphere and not enough in the stratosphere. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LRE_2">Lyng</persName> said that since the science is
                            not clear, agricultural <pb facs="1110" n="1064" xml:id="pg_1064"/>
                            scientists think that a freezing of chemicals is okay, but that we
                            should not go too far in agreeing to further reductions. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName> said that while the
                            science is in dispute, there is pressure in Congress for a strong
                            protocol. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> said he
                            hopes we instruct the U.S. delegates to get an agreement that looks good
                            and will work. Mr. Bauer asked about industry reactions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> said that an alliance of
                            industrial organizations has supported a freeze, and some of the members
                            have supported further reductions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1"
                                >Whitehead</persName> felt that the proposed ten-year reduction
                            period is reasonable.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he would consider the comments of Council
                            members and make his decisions at a later time.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Following the meeting, the President communicated his guidance for
                            the U.S. delegation in a classified memorandum to Council members.<note

                            for regulation of chemicals believed capable of future depletion of
                            stratospheric ozone?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>Beginning in the 1970’s, concerns were expressed in some parts of the
                            scientific community that continued growth in the use of certain <pb
                                facs="1111" n="1065" xml:id="pg_1065"/> chemicals would result in
                            future depletion of stratospheric ozone. Scientists’ models predict this
                            could cause adverse health and environmental effects, including
                            increased skin cancer deaths, cataracts, effects on the immune system,
                            damage to crops and materials and impacts on aquatic life. Other
                            scientists believe that some of these projections, which extend as far
                            as the year 2165, do not accurately account for numerous scientific
                            uncertainties and for future technological, scientific, medical and
                            behavioral changes that may occur. The chemicals in question,
                            chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Halons, are used commercially in
                            refrigerators, building and mobile air-conditioners, foam insulation and
                            fire extinguishers, and by the electronics industry. Some of them have
                            important national defense applications for which there are currently no
                            substitutes.</p>
                        <p>Based on their models, most scientists now believe that significant ozone
                            depletion is likely to occur by the year 2040 unless global action is
                            taken to control the chemicals at issue, even though there are numerous
                            medical and scientific uncertainties about the potential impacts of such
                            depletion. Ideally, any freeze or reduction in CFCs should be based on
                            reliable scientific evidence that use of CFCs will cause depletion of
                            stratospheric ozone. While there are differing views within the Council
                            on the reliability of the scientific evidence available at this time,
                            the long life of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> accumulations, and
                            the consequent risk assessments associated with projected ozone
                            depletion argue for strong action to secure an international agreement
                            this year, with provision for future scientific assessment. Since U.S.
                            participation in an international agreement will require domestic
                            regulations, the Domestic Policy Council will address these and
                            potential non-regulatory options as additional policy guidance is
                            needed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Congressional Interest</hi>. Concern over the predicted
                            depletion of ozone led Congress to add an ozone protection section to
                            the Clean Air Act in 1977 and led <gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>
                            to ban <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> aerosols in 1978. Some other
                            countries subsequently implemented partial bans of <gloss
                                target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> aerosol use. Currently, there is
                            strong congressional pressure for additional action to protect the ozone
                            layer. The Senate has passed a resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2"

                            Congress and the courts may require unilateral domestic reductions of
                            the chemicals in question. Such U.S. action, alone, would not protect
                            the ozone layer and would disadvantage American businesses in world

                            its leadership role in the three negotiating sessions held thus far to
                            develop an international agreement on control of the chemicals in
                            question. However, some are concerned that not all emerging
                            industrialized nations have participated in the negotiations. The U.S.
                            interagency delegation has been guided by a Circular 175 approved under
                            the authority of the Secretary of State, following approval by some
                            agencies at various staff levels. The next negotiating session is
                            scheduled for June 29, 1987<note n="4" xml:id="d371fn4">See <ref

                            effects on cancer deaths through 2165, the potential benefits of taking
                            some actions to protect the ozone layer were found to be substantially
                            greater than the costs of controlling the relevant chemicals. Cost
                            benefit analysis suggests that both a freeze and a further 20-percent
                            reduction of the ozone-depleting chemicals are economically justified.
                            Further reductions are also indicated in a majority of cases, depending
                            on information that will be acquired prior to taking such steps.</p>

                        <p>The negotiation of an international protocol for regulation of chemicals
                            believed capable of future depletion of stratospheric ozone is of great
                            importance in our efforts to adopt sound environmental policies.
                            Pursuant to this, and after considering the extensive work and
                            recommendations of the Domestic Policy Council over the past several
                            months, the following will guide the U.S. delegation in its negotiating
                            activities leading to an international protocol on protection of the
                            ozone layer, which we hope to be able to conclude later this year.</p>
                        <p>It is important that all nations that produce or use ozone-depleting
                            chemicals participate in efforts to address this problem. The U.S.
                            delegation will attempt, therefore, to ensure that the protocol enters
                            into <pb facs="1117" n="1071" xml:id="pg_1071"/> force only when a
                            substantial proportion of the producing/consuming countries have signed
                            and ratified it. I expect this to be well above a majority of the major
                            producing/consuming countries.</p>
                        <p>In order to encourage participation by all countries, it is recognized
                            that lesser developed nations should be given a limited grace period, up
                            to the year 2000, to allow some increases in their domestic consumption.
                            And, the U.S. delegation will seek to negotiate a system of voting for
                            protocol decisions that gives due weight to the significant producing
                            and consuming countries.</p>
                        <p>To achieve a majority of the health and environmental benefits derived
                            from retention of the ozone layer, and to spur industry to develop
                            substitutes for chemicals in question, the U.S. delegation will seek a
                            freeze at 1986 levels on production/consumption of all seriously
                            ozone-depleting chemicals, including chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) 11, 12,
                            113, 114, 115; and Halons 1201 and 1311, to take effect one or two years
                            after the protocol entry into force. The earliest expected date for
                            entry into force is 1988.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation will also seek strong provisions for monitoring,
                            reporting, and enforcement to secure the best possible compliance with
                            the protocol, but they need not seek a system of credits for emissions
                            reduction resulting from the 1978 U.S. ban of non-essential
                            aerosols.</p>
                        <p>In addition to a freeze, the U.S. delegation will seek a 20% reduction
                            from 1986 levels of CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115 four years after entry
                            into force of the protocol, and following a 1990 international review of
                            updated scientific evidence. The 20% reduction should take place
                            automatically, unless reversed by a 2/3 vote of parties. The U.S.
                            delegation will seek a second-phase <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            reduction of an additional 30% from 1986 levels, which would occur about
                            eight years after entry into force of the protocol, and following
                            scientific review. This would occur automatically, unless reversed by a
                            2/3 vote of parties.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation will seek a trade provision in the protocol that will
                            best protect U.S. industry in world markets, by authorizing trade
                            restrictions against <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>-related
                            imports from countries that do not join or comply with the protocol
                            provisions. It is our policy to insure that countries not be able to
                            profit from not participating in the international agreement, and to

                        <p>(A) Article 1 (Definitions and Scope)—Definitions being adjusted, in
                            particular to find non-quantitative means of defining bulk substances
                            (i.e., as a replacement for quote 20 percent by weight or volume unquote
                            expression). No major problems, although U.K. has proposed definition of
                            controlled substances that excludes <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            502, which contains 50 percent of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            115. U.S. is opposing this proposal and has offered alternative
                            definition.</p>
                        <p>(B) Article 2 Control Measures)—</p>
                        <p>(I) Base Year—Soviets arguing for 1990 base year because their 1986–1990
                            national plan calls for new <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            production capacity to meet internal consumption. U.S., <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, Nordics, Canada, New Zealand,
                            objecting, while trying to explore options which might encourage
                            accession by Soviets as well as other medium/low-consuming countries.
                            Thursday a.m. Soviets insisted on leeway to reach 0.5 kg. per capita to
                            establish their base for future reductions, which would imply addition
                            to global production of approximately 70–80,000 kilotons above existing
                            Soviet production. They argue that because of their low existing per
                            capita consumption and low historic contribution to the ozone depletion
                            problems, they should be given flexibility to increase domestic
                            consumption before embarking on phase-down schedule. Soviets are
                            adamant, but isolated. They also seem to be concerned about not signing
                            protocol, and seem generally confused by the fast and complex pace of
                            negotiations on the control article in Tolba’s quote informal unquote
                            working groups, which are held only in English.</p>
                        <p>(II) Regulatory Measures—Scenario of <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss>
                            freeze—20 percent reduction—additional 30 percent reduction appears to
                            have been accepted by all. Issue remains over timing, with consensus
                            building for 10-year period (rather than 8 years) with firm anchor date
                            of January 1, 1999 for reaching second reduction step (i.e., 50 percent
                            total reduction). <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> (pressed by U.K.
                            and France) suggests first cut of 20 percent to take effect January 1,
                            1994, rather than in 4 years after entry into force (<gloss
                                target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss>), as in previous texts. Freeze is now
                            agreed at one year after <gloss target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss> (see
                            Article 15, below).</p>
                        <p>(III) Halons—After move by <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Commission,
                            plus U.K. and France, to eliminate halons from protocol and cover them
                            merely with conference resolution calling for quote future decision by
                            parties unquote, <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> now apparently
                            willing to accept halons within protocol, with a freeze on consumption
                            after three years of <gloss target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss>, as in earlier
                            text. This would be in exchange for agreement to stretch out 50 percent
                            reduction from 8 to 10 years (see preceeding paragraph).</p>
                        <p>(<gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss>) Decision-making—After initial U.S.
                            effort to make decisions on possible reversal of controls and other
                            adjustments to protocol (e.g., addition/subtraction of chemicals;
                            further reduction steps) to require <pb facs="1120" n="1074"

                            is currently pushing for 67 percent. Debate on this not sufficiently
                            advanced to judge likely outcome, with many countries clearly favoring
                            no weighting factor at all.</p>

                            production/consumption remains a central issue, although progress has
                            been made in resolving split over adjusted production (C equals P plus I
                            minus E) as favored by U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Nordics and E.C.
                            straight production approach. Bilaterals on Sunday<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d373fn6">September 6.</note> and Tolba group discussions
                            Monday made clear that the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> arrived
                            just as committed to production controls as U.S., Canada and New Zealand
                            were to consumption controls. Nordics and Japanese favored consumption
                            controls, but made clear they were willing to accept the combined
                            controls in the seventh revised draft text as a quote compromise
                            unquote. <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> believes that proposal
                            (described below) represents sound concept compatible with U.S.
                            objectives and interests. Approach is to provide for gap between
                            consumption and production targets for individual countries (at each
                            stage of freeze/reduction scenario) which would allow the excess
                            production capacity to meet the needs of developing countries and also
                            provide for quote rationalization unquote of production among producing
                            countries by enabling, e.g. U.S. to increase production to meet Canadian
                            needs if latter closes plant which becomes inefficient after reduction
                            controls take effect. Because production increases in some countries
                            would be offset by decreases in other countries, the net effect on
                            global consumption would be neutral (except for the additional
                            consumption margin allowed to low-consuming developing countries (see
                            Article 5 below).</p>
                        <p>(C) Article 3—Calculation of Control Levels—Only issue includes concern
                            of several countries about accuracy of ozone depletion potentials and
                            suggestion that they be dropped as a factor in calculating emissions.
                                <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss> believes this will be
                            turned aside, as we and others have argued for the need to include
                            depleting potential.</p>
                        <p>Article 4—(Control of Trade)—Issues seem well on way to resolution along
                            lines of U.S. preference/guidance. However, fully-agreed text not
                            possible at this time, due primarily to Brazilian attempts to exempt

                            industry views expressed privately during these negotiations. Consensus
                            has been reached that grace period will extend for 10 years. During that

                            make further reductions during the initial 10 year grace period.</p>
                        <p>(F) Article 6—(Review and Assessment)—<gloss target="#t_USDel_1"
                                >USDel</gloss> introduced language to ensure that
                            scientific/technical/economic review, and assessments by parties, are
                            kept to main decision points of regulatory control schedule. We further
                            proposed establishment of experts panel on technological/economic
                            aspects in addition to previously agreed-upon scientific group.</p>
                        <p>(G) Articles 7–17, Data-Technical Assistance Meeting of Parties, etc.
                            With exception of Article 15, below, no major issues remain. U.K. raised
                            data confidentiality issue early in week but have not pressed any
                            language changes: and Japan questioning financial mechanism.</p>
                        <p>(H) Article 15 (Entry Into Force)—As envisioned, this remains major
                            stumbling block. <gloss target="#t_UNEP_1">UNEP</gloss> Ex Dir Tolba
                            characterized <gloss target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss> this a.m. as quote
                            the major problem, given trio of firmly held positions unquote. He
                            described these as quote famous and well-known U.S. 90 percent
                            production approach: which he observed had no support; (2) those
                            countries which favor no weighting at all; and (3) his own compromise of
                            60 percent. (Actually, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> supported
                            90 percent. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and Japan appear to have
                            no problem with 60 percent.) Problem of <gloss target="#t_EIF_1"
                                >EIF</gloss> requirement was exacerbated when <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Commission Representative Brinkhorst <pb
                                facs="1122" n="1076" xml:id="pg_1076"/> admitted that <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> assession would not carry with it the
                            ability to bring in and commit all member nations. Rather, member states
                            enjoy sovereignty of joining or not joining, so that each would probably
                            join separately, adding their votes and individual consumption
                            percentages serially. Thus, the impression of U.S. and all others up
                            until now that when <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> joins it would
                            represent over 40 percent of global production was erroneous. At this
                            point any support U.S. hoped to get for something close to 90 percent
                            requirement evaporated. Brinkhorst stated that the 9 <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> members in attendance will all sign and
                            ratify. (Non-attendees are Ireland, Greece and Portugal.) He also
                            proposed adding quote dates certain unquote to entry into force and the
                            control schedule which would call for e.g., <gloss target="#t_EIF_1"
                                >EIF</gloss> to occur by January 1, 1989 with the freeze twelve
                            months later and reduction steps as described above. (<gloss
                                target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss> would still be subject to number of
                            ratification and percentage of global consumption required.) While
                            largely symbolic, the <gloss target="#t_EIF_1">EIF</gloss> date would
                            help the Commission and more progressive <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> members to generate pressure on other <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> members to ratify (according to
                            Brinkhorst and Reps of <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, Belgium and
                            Denmark). Negotiations continuing on this issue, with U.S. holding firm
                            to its 90 percent position. This will undoubtedly be one of several
                            issues carried over into diplomatic conference. It is clear that most
                            countries willing to accept 11 country ratifications, rather than 9, to
                            bring protocol, into effect.</p>
                        <p>(I) <gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss> Issue: The <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> remains insistent that the protocol
                            include provisions which permit <gloss target="#t_REIO_1"
                            >REIO</gloss>-member states to fulfill their obligations under Article 2
                            (control measures) jointly. Their new proposal limits joint treatment
                            only to member states of such organizations that are parties to the
                            protocol and requires that such states’ joint production/consumption not
                            exceed levels set in Article 2. Significantly, the new proposal does not
                            provide for group compliance for Article 4 (control of trade with
                            non-parties). Protocol will most likely be quote mixed unquote agreement
                            for the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, that is, both the
                            organization and member states will become parties. <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Commission Representatives have
                            indicated that they expect all or virtually all <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss>-member states to join the protocol, and have stressed
                            the strong enforcement role the Commission intends to play vis-a-vis its
                            member states regarding implementation of the protocol. U.S. and other
                            delegations are studying the new <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                            proposal in conjunction with other developments.</p>

                        <p>2. Control Article: Although 1986 base year is preferred option for
                            nearly all participants, 1990 is still in brackets at request of
                            Soviets. (Soviet problem remains as described reftel.) Article calls for
                            freeze in 1989; 20 percent reduction by 1994; 50 percent reduction by
                            1999. Formula remains consumption-based with higher production levels
                            allowed. Protocol covers CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115. Halons are in
                            protocol, and frozen at 1986 levels 3 years after entry into force.</p>
                        <p>3. Entry into Force: Issue is still unresolved and percentage is
                            bracketed as 0 percent, 60 percent, 90 percent. There is appreciation of
                            U.S. view on percentage requirement, although strong opposition to 90
                            percent. Sentiment is building to base this on consumption (rather than
                            production) to symbolize stake of consumer countries as well.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_REIO_1">REIO</gloss>: Informal discussions with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and, separately with some <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>-member countries, reveal some
                            predisposition to consider changes in language of <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>’s proposal on REIOs, but opposition to
                            total deletion of provision due to their concern about restrictions on
                            trade among member states that are party to the protocol.</p>
                        <p>5. Voting: Weighted voting (Article 2, paras. 4, 5, and 5 bis) still
                            shown as quote two-thirds majority of parties representing (0 percent)
                            (60 percent) (two-thirds) of the total calculated consumption level.
                            Nordics are in lead in building pressures against any weighted voting
                            requirement here. Article 2, para. 5 still provides for weighted voting
                            (bracketed) on adjustments to reduction schedule and to calculated ozone
                            depletion potentials, which would be binding on all parties para. 5(c)
                            and 5(d). Article 2, para. 5 bis provides for weighted voting <pb
                                facs="1124" n="1078" xml:id="pg_1078"/> (bracketed) on additions or
                            removal of substances from controls. However, reference here to Article
                            9 of Convention means that individual parties would have to ratify
                            decisions on new chemicals (i.e. it is not automatically binding on
                            parties).</p>
                        <p>6. Compliance and Reporting: Article 7 bis provides that parties will at
                            their first meeting consider and approve procedures and mechanisms for
                            determining non-compliance. This protects concept that parties in
                            non-compliance would be treated as non-party, as this would, in any
                            event, need to be institutionalized at parties’ first meeting whether or
                            not it formally appears in Article 7 bis. General sentiment (Tolba and
                            other delegations) is that attempt to insist on more explicit reference
                            here would only trigger extensive and unproductive discussion. U.S.
                            intends to make declaration emphasizing that treatment as non-parties is
                            traditional practice according to Vienna Convention on treaties and that
                            we consider it would also apply to this protocol; this declaration would
                            become part of final act. Reporting of data now shown due quote nine
                            months after the end of the year to which the data relate unquote.</p>
                        <p>7. Trade and LDCs: Following hard negotiations, significant progress was
                            made. Provisional endorsement by U.S., <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss>, Japan and several <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>
                            delegations was achieved on the following package:</p>

                        <p>The U.S. delegation in Montreal and an interagency team in Washington
                            worked together to insure that your instructions were carried out.<note

                        <p>Outlined below are some of the major issues that arose during the
                            negotiations of which you should be aware:</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">Entry Into Force</hi>. The delegation was able to
                            obtain in the protocol a provision that it shall enter into force on
                            January 1, 1989, provided that it is ratified by least eleven parties
                            representing two-thirds of 1986 estimated global consumption of the
                            controlled substances. These parties would represent countries that now
                            produce over 80% of the CFCs and halons.</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">Soviet Allowance</hi>. Throughout the negotiations
                            the Soviets wanted reductions based upon 1990 production levels, because
                            of their current five year plan. The U.S. delegation and the other
                            negotiating parties were unanimously opposed to changing the base year
                            from 1986 levels. The Soviets were isolated but firm. A compromise was
                            worked out that allows any party with production facilities under
                            construction or planned for completion prior to the end of 1990 to
                            increase their annual per capita consumption of CFCs and halons up to
                            0.5 kilograms. We agreed to this because now the Soviets have agreed (as
                            did others) to report their production and consumption levels of CFCs
                            and halons—something they had opposed earlier—and are committed to limit
                            their <pb facs="1126" n="1080" xml:id="pg_1080"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> and halon production. Neither would
                            have been achieved without the compromise.</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">European Community</hi>. The European Community
                                (<gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>) proposed that any <hi
                                rend="italic">regional economic integration organization</hi> should
                            be allowed to jointly fulfill their obligations. This would, in effect,
                            allow the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> an advantage in world trade
                            markets, by permitting reductions by one member country to offset
                            increases in production by another member country as long as the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> totals were reduced. The compromise was
                            that the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> could jointly meet <hi
                                rend="italic">consumption</hi> reductions, but each country would be
                            required to individually meet reduced <hi rend="italic">production</hi>
                            levels for CFCs and halons. It was also agreed that all the member
                            countries must join in the protocol for this to be permitted.</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">Timing</hi>. Some timing changes were also accepted
                            to get more desirable features in the protocol. The freeze on halons
                            will take effect at the end of three years, instead of the “one or two
                            years” contained in your instructions. This was needed to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> to agree to include halons in the
                            controlled substances listing. Also, a ten year period for the 50%
                            reduction of CFCs was agreed to, instead of the “about eight years”
                            contained in your instructions. The first phase of a 20% reduction of
                            CFCs will occur during the fifth year after entry into force, instead of
                            the “four years” contained in your instructions. The second phase, a
                            further 30% <gloss target="#t_CFC_1">CFC</gloss> reduction, will occur
                            five years after the first phase. This timing ensured that Japan would
                            agree to the protocol.</p>
                        <p>All of the fundamental principles contained in your instructions—a
                            weighted voting system, a grace period for lesser developed countries,
                            strong enforcement provisions, periodic assessments of the control
                            provisions, and equitable trade provisions—were incorporated into the
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the United States was a leader in drafting an international
                            protocol that will reach your ultimate objective of protecting the ozone
                            layer through supporting actions determined to be necessary based on
                            regularly scheduled scientific assessments. This is a significant
                            Administration achievement on both the domestic and the world
                            environmental front.<note n="4" xml:id="d375fn4">President <persName

                        <p>The Montreal Protocol, negotiated under the auspices of the United
                            Nations Environment Program, is a supplemental agreement to the Vienna
                            Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, adopted in March 1985
                            and ratified by the United States in August 1986. The Protocol provides
                            for internationally coordinated control of ozone-depleting substances in
                            order to protect public health and the environment from potential
                            adverse effects of depletion of stratospheric ozone. The Protocol
                            establishes an obligation to limit consumption and production of
                            ozone-depleting substances and restricts trade in controlled substances
                            with States not party to the Protocol. United States ratification is
                            necessary for entry into force and effective implementation of the
                            Protocol.</p>
